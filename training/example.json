Our task was to design an \"evil hangman\" game that would covertly change the word the user was guessing every time they picked a letter so that the new word doesn't contain any of those letters. Maybe for some this would be simple, but I'm not the best at this class so it took me a long time to figure out the logic behind the game, and it wasn't fully functional until the day before it was due.\n\nThe problem is, one of my group members spent a long time designing nice-looking menus, game screens, etc. but made no effort to understand how the game actually works. She didn't attempt to understand or help with the game logic and just spent her time drawing elaborate menu screens (without considering that the rest of us were too busy doing the actual hard work to add in the bells and whistles she was building buttons for). As the deadline approached it became clear that she didn't know how to use our code to actually get her screens to draw at the right times, because she hadn't paid attention or asked any questions about what the rest of the group was doing (she did not even bother to read the code containing the actual game logic). Ultimately we tried to help her but by the time we realized the problem it was too late, so almost none of her work actually made it into the final program. \n\nI understand that she did spend as much time working on the project as everyone else, but I found it extremely annoying that she spent all of her time trying to make the game \"look pretty\" without attempting to contribute to the actual challenging parts of building the game. As a result, when evaluating the group, I reported that she had done the least work, as none of what she had done ended up helping us in any way. Ultimately this will probably hurt her grade. AITA for giving her a bad evaluation?\n\nEDIT: To add some info about the eval, all we could do was assign a percentage of the work done by each of our groupmates (ourselves not included). So my other two groupmates were given grades of higher than 33%, while the member in question got less than 33%. There was no way to actually describe each member's contributions besides just giving a number",

It sounds like she covered aspects that you and other group members hadn\u2019t considered to be important, but still needed some work."
