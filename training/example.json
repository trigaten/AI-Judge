        "title": "AITA for giving my group member a bad eval even though she spent as long on the project as everyone else?",
        "post_body": "I'm currently taking a data structures CS class in college, and we just turned in our group project for the semester. Our task was to design an \"evil hangman\" game that would covertly change the word the user was guessing every time they picked a letter so that the new word doesn't contain any of those letters. Maybe for some this would be simple, but I'm not the best at this class so it took me a long time to figure out the logic behind the game, and it wasn't fully functional until the day before it was due.\n\nThe problem is, one of my group members spent a long time designing nice-looking menus, game screens, etc. but made no effort to understand how the game actually works. She didn't attempt to understand or help with the game logic and just spent her time drawing elaborate menu screens (without considering that the rest of us were too busy doing the actual hard work to add in the bells and whistles she was building buttons for). As the deadline approached it became clear that she didn't know how to use our code to actually get her screens to draw at the right times, because she hadn't paid attention or asked any questions about what the rest of the group was doing (she did not even bother to read the code containing the actual game logic). Ultimately we tried to help her but by the time we realized the problem it was too late, so almost none of her work actually made it into the final program. \n\nI understand that she did spend as much time working on the project as everyone else, but I found it extremely annoying that she spent all of her time trying to make the game \"look pretty\" without attempting to contribute to the actual challenging parts of building the game. As a result, when evaluating the group, I reported that she had done the least work, as none of what she had done ended up helping us in any way. Ultimately this will probably hurt her grade. AITA for giving her a bad evaluation?\n\nEDIT: To add some info about the eval, all we could do was assign a percentage of the work done by each of our groupmates (ourselves not included). So my other two groupmates were given grades of higher than 33%, while the member in question got less than 33%. There was no way to actually describe each member's contributions besides just giving a number",

It sounds like she covered aspects that you and other group members hadn\u2019t considered to be important, but still needed some work."

        "post_body": "My SO (24 M) and I (21 F) started out as really good friends at first. He was a really cool guy and we hit it off. We spent a lot of time together, and he confessed he had feelings for me. However, I told him that I prefer women (I\u2019m bisexual), and he lost it. He got mad at me for leading him on, which I won\u2019t deny, because I didn\u2019t explicitly say no. He did say he had a crush on me, but I was vague about it. I told him it was okay that he felt that way, but I didn\u2019t outrun say I didn\u2019t feel the same.\nAfter I rejected him, he became suicidal and would constantly corner me, telling me that it was my fault that he wanted to kill himself, and kept berating me. Every time we spoke, it would always fall back to me rejecting him. We couldn\u2019t even say one word before we started fighting over it. I wanted to tell him it was emotionally manipulative, but he said I was no better(which I think he\u2019s right. Giving him hope was a shitty thing to do.) It was taking its toll on me, and it got to the point where my own mental health was taking a hit. So during yet another fight, I told him I did feel something for him. \nHe was elated and the fighting stopped, and we began dating. I told myself that I would fall in love with him gradually over time, but I\u2019m not feeling anything more than friendship. It\u2019s been six months. And if I end it, it\u2019s right back to the fighting and him threatening to kill himself because I led him on and don\u2019t want to date him.\n\nAMITA for saying yes and lying to his face?

        "post_body": "Back story, wife is friends with a \u201cbullish\u201d woman whom I have repeatedly asked to stop being \u201ctom boyish\u201d or physical with me, basically invading my \u2018bubble\u2019.  Nothing really sexual about it, just makes me uncomfortable and I feel it disrespects my wife, as if a male was to act like that around her and me, it would irk me to no end.  My wife thinks its funny.\n\nThis woman has a 13 year old daughter who I would say on the younger side mentally, but more mature physically, and i would say she has some of her mothers traits.  \n\nShe stayed with us, as she has previously, both have.\n\nThe incident in question was minor, I was leaving a room with food in my hand then out of nowhere a surprise punch happened in the middle of my back, it didn't hurt, but it was hard I guess for a 13 yr old, i was certainly caught off guard and shocked (I am a jumpy guy ). At this point i faced the girl and said in a stern voice, \u201cI'm serious, do not punch me again\u201d at which point she punched my shoulder, again not hard, but enough to be seen as a \u201cnot listening challenge\u201d, i then asked her to stop again and stated something along the lines about i am serious again, at which point again she punched out.  I believe it was either in response to that or another attempt is when i took hold of her wrist.\n\nI want to emphasize i was not gripping her, nor making her arm move in any abnormal  way, it was a relaxed hold.  i am at least 3 times her weight and probably 18\u201d taller, if i wanted to \u201cphysically restrain\u201d her beyond stopping her being able to throw punches I could have.\n\nNo marks, no cries out, she was giggling like it was a challenge.\n\nSo why AITA question? Because my wife took it upon herself to chastise me about placing my hands on someone else's kid, how it was inappropriate and how I should apologize to the girl.  Maybe all valid points but she did this in front of the girl, to the point of when I tried to explain myself and what i was doing what i was doing, the girl said \u201cmaybe you should stop speaking now\u201d, but my wife thinks I am completely in the wrong and I feel she has belittled and emasculated me.\n\nI freely admit i have a dry sense of humor and there is joking verbally all round in certain situations.\n\n\n**Edit 1 : wow this blew the f\u2019k up.  Couple of points. I love my wife, she is the center of my universe, this post came from an area of understanding for myself to see if I was in fact in the wrong.  It seems I would have reacted the way most people do.\n\nAlso, with regards to the bullish mother, I did not articulate that I had expressed concerns about this to her and my wife to get it to stop, and in the main it has since I addressed it.\n\nThe mother herself was the victim of abuse previously, whilst at the time of the incident (girl punching me) it did not cross my mind, she was also raised in an environment that this is acceptable. (Not an excuse)\n\nWe all tease each other verbally when around, I have made it clear it didn't need to cross into physical, the incident in question did not impact me physically.\n\nI did converse what the actual problem was with my wife was, in the end it was her reaction more so than the 13 yr old, we will continue to communicate and learn from this experience and try to get to a place of mutual understanding.  When two people are at a heads in an emotional place, its good to have independent people to bring in a non emotional perspective, so thank you.\n\nAlso anyone who went from this incident to divorce is way into the weeds of crazy town :)**\n\n**Edit 2 : I wanted to wrap this up and say a few things, firstly thank you for those who gave responses that didn't involve going overboard *(It is ironic that those who feel I was disrespected by my wife, articulated it by feeling the need to disrespect her too)*.  I spoke to my wife and the girl involved separately.  I told the girl in question that I was sorry that the situation \"after\" the incident was hostile between me and my wife, but made it very clear why I was NOT apologizing for restraining her, I explained to her as she grows up, she will understand the value of boundaries.  My wife, we spoke and I told her again that I felt she did not assist in the situation, I told her in future if there is any disagreement like that, she should either wait till we are alone or not at all.  I made it clear to her why I was upset with her (not the teenager), and her use of terminology around me and the teenager could only undermine me and could lead to an escalation of a situation which could be far worse.  I wont be adding anything more to this.**\n\n**Tl/dr - Wifes' friend daughter who stays with us from time to time, surprised punched me in the back, when i tried to adult to get her to stop, she continued, I held her wrist in a manner that just prevented myself being punched ?

Thanks again, this really helps.\n\nObviously this is a throwaway account. People know my usual account.\n\nI'll try to keep it short.\n\nMy relationship with my bf (20m) (I'm also 20) has been mostly good but going downhill recently for a lot of reasons that aren't the topic of this post.\n\nAnyway, over the last several weeks, every once in awhile my boyfriend will make sexual jokes at my expense and include \"our\" friends in the jokes; I say \"our\" because I am the only girl in this friend group and all of the other guys seem to prefer my bf. The jokes have been anything between implying I took part in a sexual act (which may or may not have been true, depending on what they joke about) to making a joke explicitly about me, saying something like \"OP must do X or act like Y in bed, hahaha!\"\n\nMy bf sometimes makes the joke, sometimes one of the other guys does. Either way he seems to think they're very funny. I do not and have either explicitly told him so (calmly and only to him) or just tried to ignore it and avoid it through body language, etc. The jokes make me extremely uncomfortable. Nothing has worked obviously since the jokes still happen occasionally.\n\nToday it happened again and something in me just snapped and I couldn't control the words before they came out. We were all at dinner at a busy dining hall at our university, and another joke was made. All the guys thought it was funny again. Suddenly I snapped at my boyfriend, but definitely not shouting, more like a very angry loud whisper (nobody else in the dining hall seemed to notice).\n\nI basically said \"Stop it. That's not funny.\" Everyone at the table suddenly looked awkward even though I only addressed my bf. My bf looked flabbergasted for a moment before he looked angry and said (kinda paraphrasing) \"you do not speak to me like that in front of my friends. that is incredibly embarrassing and rude.\" I attempted to apologize, I said \"sorry for saying that like that,\" but he didn't seem to accept my attempts to apologize so I dropped it. I think I only tried to apologize to keep him from being too mad at me. It would have felt wrong to apologize for trying to stand up for myself. Does that make sense?\n\nLater this evening, my bf said what I did is considered emotional abuse and that I have issues. None of my \"friends\" have said anything about the incident.\n\nWe are probably breaking up soon, but I want to know if I deserve my bf's frustration.\n\nAITA for snapping at my bf in front of his/\"our\" friends?

        "post_body": "My wife and I have a pretty solid routine, and I think a really good relationship.  We've never had any fights, nobody has cheated, etc. We've known each other about 8 years, been together for 5, married for 2.  We have an 11mo old daughter.    \n\nTonight, we're doing the same thing we do every night, unwind on the couch in front of Netflix while the baby gets tired enough to put to bed.    \n\nTonight, though, my wife gets frustrated with the baby, puts her on the ground and goes off to another room.  I pick the baby up.  After about a half hour, she's asleep in my arms, and I take her upstairs and put her to bed in her crib.    \n\nI come back downstairs and go to use the toilet, walking through the dining room, where our computer is.  When I open the door, my wife, who is sitting in the dark in front of the laptop with a show playing louder than usual, quickly hides her phone against her chest and looks up at me.    \n\nAll of this is unusual.  She never hides her phone, never hangs out in the dark watching a show by herself.    \n\nI ask her if she's okay.  She says yes, and has slid the phone down below the table.    \n\nI go on to use the toilet and then go back through the room out to the living room, but I can't shake what happened.  It's bothering me and I can't shake it.    \n\nSo I go back into the computer room - I am aware that I'm trying not to be heard, though not proud of it - and I'm not heard.  I open the door.  The phone immediately goes down again, and she closes a window that's in the upper-left of the laptop screen.    \n\nI don't know what to say, and make like I needed to go back to the toilet.  I didn't stay in there long, though.  I came back out and asked her again if she was sure she's okay.  She says she is.    \n\nSo I told her - I've never seen her hide her phone like that, and asked her if she was hiding something.  I want to think Xmas shopping, but I've been burned before, so there's a part of me that thinks its not Xmas shopping.   \n\nShe says she wasn't hiding anything, and do I want to look at her phone?  I say no, I don't, and that I'm sorry, I didn't think she was doing anything wrong.  Then she says, defensively, that yes, I did think she was doing something wrong, and I said I was sorry again, that she just didn't usually act like this.    \n\nShe went upstairs to bed.  That was probably two hours ago.    \n\nI don't know if I'm going to sleep at all tonight.  She's my best friend, and has never given me any reason to think she might be cheating, so I'm sure this is just me overreacting, but fuck, she was hiding something.    \n\nAm I the asshole?  What do I do now?    \n    \nEDIT: I really appreciate everyone's feedback.  It helps a lot to know my feelings aren't totally out of whack, but not to overreact, either.  It took me a while to settle my mind down enough to get to sleep last night, but when I got into bed, I told her that I loved her, and she said she loved me too.  Then I said I'm sorry, and she said it's okay.  Wife and baby are still asleep (I wake up pretty early regardless of when I go to bed, which sucks sometimes because it means I have to get through today on about 4.5 hours of sleep), but I think when she wakes up things will be okay.

I'm wondering if she's stressed by the baby and maybe she has someone she uses for social support and she was talking to them about it. Maybe a support group, or another mom or a therapist or something? Maybe she's searching the web for \"why do I feel negatively towards my baby?\" or something and she's ashamed. Birth and young babies can be stressful and really mess with your mood. But you won't know unless you talk. I would sit down when the baby is napping and she's not totally stressed and ask her how she's doing, and then bring up the topic again to see if she's willing to talk some more about it. "

This conversation about guns started because i wanted to buy a rifle, this is before she ever told me how she felt.

She then says how she wants a handgun for self defense still. I asked what\u2019s her reasoning why the handgun is less dangerous and her only reasoning was because the AR is big and not for self defense. I felt that wasnt really a reason at all but just the way she feels about it. I told her i would be fine with no guns in the house because you feel they are dangerous, but cherry picking one over the other didn\u2019t make sense. That\u2019s what started all this. I do see how I was being petty in a sense by using the argument \u201cit\u2019s only fair\u201d but that was because she gave me no reason why the rifle was more dangerous to keep in a house then a handgun. \n\nEDIT 3: I do appreciate everyone\u2019s feed back. It is interesting to see drastic views on firearms. I do want everyone to know we talked it over more, and just said no to having guns in the house for now. Also do want to say I love my wife, she\u2019s the greatest thing to happen to me. We just had different views on firearms, and both overreacted when arguing about it. We are good now.  \n\nEDIT 4: No guns have been bought. All this was a discussion about wanting to buy guns. Sorry if the wording made it seem like the guns have already been bought. I asked this because i wanted to take a step back from the problem and  see what other people\u2019s perspective were on this topic. Hearing your answers definitely helped open my eyes. Thanks for taking the time to share your input with me. ",

For many reasons, people tend to be really biased when it's about firearms (on both sides of the spectrum).\n\nLet's say it's exotic animals. Your wife says she's scared of lizards but really wants an iguana. Doesn't really matter that they're the same-ish thing. The fact she's scared of one should be enough reason not get it or to have a long conversation trying to reach an agreement on circumstances on which she can be comfortable with a lizard (the kind of cage, location of it, etc.). Don't be petty just because you're \"right.\" Respect your wife's fears and either talk it out or skip getting the lizard. "

        "post_body": "We were together for 4.5 years, and I had told him since year 1, I am not comfortable with an engagement ring. When I was a kid, I watched someone's ring get caught in the fence and this man lost a piece of his finger. Additionally, I come from a family of contractors so the stories of people getting rings caught into things are plenty (many people don't wear rings in my family, but are happily married). I have this fear my engagement ring would get caught. I offered alternatives like a tattoo, rubber rings, or just a thin band.\n\nFor years he said \"If I get a ring, you're wearing it, you're irrational, that's so stupid, I'm not wearing a wedding ring then\". I told him if it is his decision to not wear a wedding band because he is worried now too, I would respect that ( although he just said it to seemingly get even). I understand my fear my be irrational to someone else, but it is a real fear to me. Fast forward 3.5 years into our courtship, I get an engagement ring. I cry at the proposal, say yes, we are both beaming. BEAUTIFUL ring btw, and I thanked him for it. I wear the ring for 4 months, it gets caught numerous times on things. To a normal person I guess, it wouldn't bother them, but to me, it made me feel anxious. I expressed this to my ex. I stopped wearing the ring the last 6 months of our relationship.  \n\nI will also add that I wore a promise ring for a little while prior to the engagement. It rarely got caught and helped me feel better about rings, including the thought of wearing a wedding band. However, the engagement ring was another story, it would get caught a decent amount of times and its easier to remember I was wearing a ring. I'll also add that I work in a public safety related field and sometimes I wear gloves ( drugs and bodily fluids mostly), the engagement ring ripped through them. \n\nIt's not like I didn't want to wear the ring to hide my relationship status, I didn't like him, didn't really want to be engaged, or anything like that...I legit worry due to the bulkier nature of an engagement ring I could get it caught and it could harm me. I expressed it to him numerous times how I felt and it felt like it fell on deaf ears. \n\nI'm reflecting back on the relationship (don't want to make the same mistakes next relationship) and this is one of the reasons he broke up with me, citing \" YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST ACCEPTED THE RING\". I felt like I did accept the ring, I never complained about it, just didn't feel comfortable wearing it. AITA for not wearing the ring? ",

It sounds like you tried really hard to compromise for him, while he didn't care about your feelings at all."

She got a manager in &lt;5 minutes. Couldn\u2019t believe it.\nHe was very kind and actually happened to be from another nearby park and was very understanding.

However people on this sub will proceed to ridicule and be mean to the OP in what I believe is beyond reasonable. Sure sometimes someone is the rude asshole in an argument, or they do something they shouldn\u2019t. However that just makes them people (IE, you!), not psychopaths, cruel, lazy, etc. They are the asshole, and thats it.

She is going on a trip to see her parents (other side of America) and was talking about getting to the Airport. I suggested having John take her since she trusts him, even though I don't really care for me. She said \"I thought you didn't like him?\"\n\nI replied \"I don't, but I trust you\"\n\nShe then panned the camera around to him, shirtless in her bed. They were both fully clothed otherwise. I freaked out a bit. I hung up on her, and when she called back I was pretty upset. She apologized, sent him home, and explained that he was helping her wash the dogs (Shes 5' 100lbs, they are both pitbulls) and his shirt got wet, so she put it in the drier. I said \"Well, we have different morality of what's okay in a relationship.\" She tried to joke it off commenting on my having something to eat saying \"Well you have a snack in bed too\" and that's when I lost it. \n\nMy Fiance has problems sleeping. I often tell her little stories to get her to bed. I told her \"How about next time you can't sleep you call John too!\" and hung up. She called until I picked up and apologized after sending him home, and cried about how she acted. All was good until I went to work.\n\n\nDuring my work shift, it just ate at the back of my head. My fianc\u00e9 usually calls about an hour after I get off before I go to bed. When she called I told her I needed a nights rest to really get over what happened. She called me a dick and hung up.

        "post_body": "Hi folks, LTL/FTP, finally had an intriguing but not depressing AITA moment come up. I know how I feel, but I'm curious if posting this will vindicate me and get this off my conscience. Or you're all going to verify. So this should be fun!\n\nBackground: Work-wise, our office is fairly small. There is one hallway between six offices, and it's impossible not to pass pretty much all of them to get from the break room to the front/reception. Co-worker, we'll call her L, has eleven dogs. That is not a typo. I don't think she's a dog hoarder in the negative sense, so I mean i'm not going to scurry to the ASPCA or anything. I think circumstance and dying family members dropped pairs of pups on her at a time. But lordy, the smell on her clothes just permeates everything when she's in a space for a while.\n\nSo, on to the incident. I won't bore you with the details but, I didn't sleep but 2 hours last night and then had a godawful morning. I'm walking by her office and I get hit in the face with this wall of dog stink, like that smell you get right after you washed them and they're still drying, but you didn't use enough shampoo to leave the shampoo smell and instead you get vaguely clean-ish wet dog.\n\nI'm thinking, no baby Jesus, this is not happening today. Now, L hates perfume smells, and I don't really blame her. I'll get stuffy when someone lights one of those candles or whatever, too. But here I am thinking, \"L isn't here yet, so i'm going to febreeze her office. The perfume will dissipate before she gets here and everyone wins.\"\n\nI grab the febreeze can from the bathroom and walk in like a firefighter with an extinguisher, just going ham on her carpet. A bathroom bomb gets two sprays of the can? I think I was up to about eight before I headed out of her office and put the deodorizer back in the bathroom.\n\nWell, folks, here's the problem. L WAS HERE. She was just in the back office and hadn't settled in yet. I can see hers from mine. (There's a corner in that aforementioned hallway, and ours are facing each other's.) A couple of minutes later, she gets back to her office, stands outside of it frowning for a moment, then walks up to the reception area instead of going in.\n\nYa'll, AITA?  I mean, i'm kinda mortified either way, but... curious of your verdict. Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate edit:  We ended up talking later in the day.\n\nAs a semi amusing update, she has a Christmas tree in her office, and our front desk girl is allergic to pine. So she thought the front desk girl did it to kill the pine in the air.\n\nAs we were talking about that I fessed up, mostly. I told her I let one rip in her office because I thought she wasn't there and could tell it stank, so I breezed it up.\n\nSeriously small office. It went over fine and I feel better for apologizing without letting her feel like it was about her. When I am better rested, I won't mind the dogsmell wall. I just look like an overly fervent febreezer.",

        "post_body": "As a bit of a background - both my wife and I are professionals, earning a good wage and have a two year old son.  We've never been one to splash cash, or show off... and we have a variety of friends.  Most of our friends however fall into the category of professionals and I'd assume household incomes in excess of \u00a3100K were fairly common.  I.e, they aren't struggling.  This will become relevant later.\n\nNow, we're good friends with a couple who live near us, who also have a two year old (a couple of months older than our son).  So it makes sense that we hang out a bit, given the kids go to the same nursery, and seem to like playing together etc.  So we do family outings to the zoo, or go on walks together etc.\n\nEverything was fine until my son started talking.  Like a real chatterbox.  We spend a lot of the time on these outings talking to our son, and teaching him new words.  We also try and do the same with their son.  The thing is he's not a talker.  Yes, people say our son talks beyond his age, but i also know he was amongst the last to walk amongst his peers. I've always prescribed to the \"Kids do things at different ages philosophy\", and as such have never really gave it much notice.\n\nA couple of times now I've received passive aggressive comments from these friends about constantly proving my son can talk better than ours.  They even said once that my son was \"acting like a trained monkey\".  This pissed me off.  A lot.  I am not showing off, he asks questions about what things are called, and repeats them, and understands them.  He enjoys it.  It's also what's best for my child.\n\nWe have now also started to get comments about the price of things, and whether we should really be getting our child a certain toy, or take him to so many places as he'll be \"spoilt\".  This is also something I'm acutely aware of and yes my son gets gifts, sure... but we have never, ever brought him something when he demanded it in a shop, and have taught him manners.  From when he was a year old we let him look at toys in the shop, but made him say \"bye bye\" to them, and put them back on the shelf himself.  Going back to one of my first points... they have plenty of disposable cash themselves it's not like I'm sending my kid of horse riding whilst they're struggling to buy food.\n\nI can see where they're coming from, and my wife seems to think we should dial our communication down with our son when we're with them, and maybe hide some of his toys to prevent comment from them.\n\nBut I absolutely refuse to. I talk to my son the same way when we're alone, and I'm not going to cater to their wants.  If this was a normal \"be aware of others feelings and circumstances\" things, I'd think I was being an ass hole.  But as this will limit my son's enjoyment of things I simply refuse to cater to it.\n\nSo, am I entitled to my views?  Or am I blinded by my son, and being an ass hole?",

It was good. It would continue to happen at least once a week, sometimes more. I could always tell I was more interested in initiating it than she was. She always seemed to enjoy it, responding in the right ways, but she would show a lot of concern as to whether I was enjoying it, even asking me to be more audible. \n\nWe moved in together about three months ago and did it maybe two times in the first month. Then it all fell apart when she had a really bad ptsd episode. I asked for sex and she said yes, but when we were done she started crying as I comforted her and she kept saying sorry and that she couldnt figure out why she was so \u201cbroken\u201d. It was horrible and scarred me significantly to see her like that and know that I caused it. It was a month before I even thought about sex in any way again. \n\nNow Im beginning to feel very lonely.

        "post_body": "Okay so this is a really complicated situation but I\u2019ll try to simplify as much as possible. \n\nMy friend (let\u2019s call her Jill) is dating a guy (Jack, let\u2019s say). All three of us went to a party at an apartment that belongs to mutual friends. At the party Jack introduced us to his friend that was visiting from out of town (I\u2019ll call him Bob). \n\nJack ended up leaving the party early. I forget why he left but I thought Jill would go with him. She ended up staging at the party. \n\nOkay so the plan was for Bob to stay over at the apartment where the party was being held. (He wasn\u2019t going to stay w Jack bc Jack lives in the dorms, and there\u2019s like no space, and the apartment has a couch and living room). So it just was supposed to be the girls that live in the apartment and Bob. That\u2019s it. \n\nFor some reason though my friend, Jill decides she wants to stay over too. This made no sense at all because the dorms where we live are less than a block away and, again, Jack is no longer there. But I was like okay, whatever. I ended up leaving by myself to go back to the dorms. \n\nFast forward like 3-4 hours. Jill comes to my dorm room (it must have been past 3 am at that point because I left before midnight). She\u2019s all upset saying we need to talk. I asked what happened and she pulls off her scarf and shows me her neck. I asked if the marks were hickies and she said yes. So I\u2019m like uhh wtf happened. And she tells me that she and Bob had sex. She breaks down and starts crying about how Jack is going to dump her. I\u2019m trying to be comforting but I really don\u2019t know what to say so she ends up leaving. \n\nThe next day, all hell breaks loose. Jill went back to the girls\u2019 whose apartment the party happened at and says Bob raped her. Now, I should mention, these girls are more friends with Jack than Jill \u2014 so I imagine they would have said something to Jack eventually. Anyway, they end up calling her a liar and saying that they are in the apartment too and that didn\u2019t happen, and on and on. (One of the girls apparently walked in on Jill and Bob by accident and them getting it on, I guess). They\u2019re texting Jill in a group text and Jill is sending me all the screenshots. \n\nSo I end up going to Jill\u2019s room because I\u2019m totally confused now. I asked her to explain to me what actually happened. \n\nJill ends up now saying that she said no and the guy forced himself on her. Apparently this happened in the living room and the girls were in their own bedrooms. I asked why she didn\u2019t yell out for one of the girls but she didn\u2019t have any answer. I also asked about the marks on her neck again and she said they were actually choke marks. \n\nOkay I know this is f\u2019ed up but I honestly have my doubts about this story. In the back of my mind I\u2019m wondering if she cheated on Jack and is now saying she was forced to cover it up.\n\nStill, I went with her to the ER to get the rape kit done (I was at the hospital basically all night so forgive me if this post isn\u2019t the most coherent). There was no real evidence because she\u2019d showered and whatnot. \n\nI\u2019ve been checking in on Jill a lot today. She\u2019s not doing too well (Jack dumped her). I told her I\u2019ll walk her to the mental health clinic tomorrow if she needs it. \n\nWe\u2019ve also discussed going to the cops. The problem is if they question me...what am I even gonna say??

        "post_body": "So my wife has an apartment in canary wharf near where she works; in case either of us have projects or deals close to deadlines and we have to work absurd hours, usually we live out in Surrey in the countryside outside of the big city. \n\nSo one day after work, she goes to the apartment and the key snaps in the lock of the main door (not her apartment). The services refused to come out as it was something like 11PM and she had no choice but to get a train back home to where I was even though she had to get to work at 6am the next morning, which meant she had very little sleep and was exhausted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day the services rang and their handyman came over and inspected the lock and said that he couldn't fix it and that we would have to call a locksmith and pay for it ourselves because it was her fault. Okay, fair enough I guess, she did break it after all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe both finished work at like 10PM and we book an appointment for a locksmith for quarter past. He charges double due to the late hours but that's fair enough as we don't have enough time. It takes him 2 hours to fix the lock. He says unfortunately its going to cost \u00a3450. Given the time, complexity, we don't think this is unfair. He then says bill it to the services as whoever did maintainence on the lock broke lots of regulations and took massive cost cutting measures and the lock would have broken at any point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we ring the services and explain the next day and demand they pay. The handyman then rings us and is aggressive saying we're lying, the locksmith is lying, he didn't cut corners etc. We then send an invoice to the services. The handyman replies to the email and in his footer is his address (which is important later). Anyway, there's a dispute. I get my lawyers involved and we win after getting multiple experts and statements etc. The services company pays out \u00a3670 to us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months later (Last Friday), services ring us and tells us someone is coming to make sure all the gas/electric meters in the apartments are working. We make nothing of us, we weren't busy with work and were living in our Surrey house. We go out for drinks in the city and we decide to stay in our Canary wharf apartment as no trains were going to our main home that late. We go back to find the place trashed. Fridge smashed, food all over the place, furniture broken, sofas slashed, TV smashed etc etc. My wife installed a camera in the kitchen and living room because we don't go to that apartment often and so we were extra careful. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe look on the cameras. Shock horror, the handyman comes in with his friend to check the meters, then proceeds to trash our flat. We're so angry. My wife is about to call the police but I tell her not to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI call my brother in law, who is the dodgiest bloke I know but he likes me. He gathers his friends. They go to the address the next day at 1Pm and we trash the place worse than they trashed ours. He lives out in Essex but my in laws friends do a great job and sent me photos. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is now fuming at me and her brother for taking it in our own hands. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "post_body": "I don't want a baby. I never wanted a baby. We are 24 and 25. She is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact I don't want one wasn't an issue. Now she is looking into other methods that could work. \n\nThis woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \n\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE. Just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby I never wanted with a dead mother. \n\nMy father died when I was 3, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I don't want that for my child. I watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.\n\n I know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. Is it selfish that I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? \n\nI just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, I don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. \n\nAs you can probably tell by reading this, I can be a bit of a prick. But I don't think I'm being a prick right now. Let me know.\n\nUPDATE: first of all i'd like to apologise, I mislead you, my SO and I are recently engaged, not yet married. I said, wife, because i realise that a very large section of the people who read this would tell me to leave the relationship because being in the same headspace is essential for marriage. if she leaves me because she wants a family then i understand, but it's not an option I'm considering. \n\nI love her massively, I don't think she is interested in heading back onto the dating scene, and oxygen tanks can put some guys off. I've promised her i will look after her and I'm not going back on that. - im really sorry about that guys, i was trying to narrow down the advice to just yes or no rather than reading through loads of comments telling me to GTFO, but i accidentally made some people question if this was real - and by extension question their faith in humanity.... \n\nSecondly, when my SO and i met shortly before she was diagnosed and told that a baby was off the table, so we headed towards our future assuming that we were on the same page. \n\nthirdly, many people are asking what her illness is, i wasn't going to say because i was worried she would find the post and get upset. but because this thread is becoming so popular i think its a good opportunity to raise awareness about a very rare illness called pulmonary hypertension. you can read about it here: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pulmonary-hypertension/causes/\n\nfinally I would like to thank all of you. Almost without acception, you have been incredibly kind and supportive. some of you think I should have the baby, some of you think its a terrible idea, but all of you are being honest, supportive and kind.

        "post_body": "I went to a concert last weekend and had an interaction that is still nagging at me. I truly don't know if I was the asshole. Sorry for the length, I want to include all the details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl:dr A shorter guy at a concert tried to prevent us from standing 4 feet in front of him to protect his view, but we stood there anyway because we felt his request was ridiculous and entitled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a general admission show, where the entire ground floor is just standing room. My partner and I arrived about 5-10 minutes before the band would be starting. We are both on the tall side (I am 5'9\", he is 6'1\"). We found a decent spot to stand about 3/4 of the way back from the stage, but as I was looking around, I saw a pocket of empty space up ahead that would put us 10-15 feet closer. So we maneuver into that pocket of empty space. Immediately a guy behind us taps my bf on the shoulder, and asks us to not stand there because he can't see over us. I would guess the guy was maybe 5'4\" or so (I'm going to call him \"the short guy\" from here on out, which I don't mean as an insult, just a description). And he was not especially polite, but rather kind of bratty about it. My bf was rather surprised by this request, and he responded \"um, alright, would you like to switch spots and stand in front of us?\" To which the short guy replied no, he can't see over the people that were standing in front of us either. **Important note:** there was at least 4 feet of empty space in front of the short guy that he was trying to protect for himself. Meaning, when we went to stand in that spot, there was no one immediately behind us, just the short guy, 4 feet behind us. It is not like we pushed through the crowd and parked ourselves a few inches directly in front of a much shorter person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen he also refused to switch spots with us, my bf was sort of flummoxed, so he grabbed my hand and started to move us to another spot behind the short guy. Up until that point I had just been a confused observer. But when my bf tried to actually move us out of this guy's way, I had to stop us. I said to the short guy (rather incredulously I'm sure) \"hold on, excuse me, so you are you really expecting no one to stand in this space in front of you for the entire show???\" He kind of shrugged like yep, so what. He then also gestured to some people seated in chairs several feet behind him (in the ADA section) and said \"they might like to see better too,\" but I suspect he was only using that to further his cause, since there were already other people standing in front of them, himself included. I stared at him and he stared at me for a few tense seconds, then my bf was like alright, sorry, we're doing this - and we returned to our spot 4 feet in front of the short guy. BF turned around and said \"sorry man, you're still welcome to stand in font of us, but we're standing here.\" Short guy looked annoyed and pissed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not normally confrontational but something in this situation ignited me, and I spent the rest of the show feeling like the short guy was staring daggers into the back of my head and wondering if I just pulled a major dick move. But it's a general admission show - is someone really entitled to a bubble of space because of their height? Am I not allowed to stand in certain spots because of *my* height? Obviously I think the answer is no, but curious to get others' perspectives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, that bubble of space immediately behind us stayed empty for quite a long time after that, until we decided to leave and get a drink at least, so either truly no one else tried to stand there, or he was successful in his campaign for anyone else who tried. Which also made me wonder if we were the only assholes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: Feeling better about this situation now, thanks for your opinions. I never want to be the asshole, and confrontations like this give me so much anxiety (for days after they happen). Hopefully this was a total fluke, but I'll certainly be more aware of our shorter friends in the future anyway!",

She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything.

        "post_body": "Throwaway account. Originally posted in r/AITA and I deleted the original post and reposted here once I realized this is the correct subreddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis happened to me back in high school. One of my classmates, let's call him Tim, was this really innocent, sweet-looking school kid. He was an average student, was deferential to teachers and adults, and was generally liked by the popular kids in my school. Tim was about 5'2'' in height and had a generally pleasant appearance/demeanor. He was a bit of a class clown in that he'd make jokes in class and was generally regarded as this fun-loving, do-no-wrong kid by many.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't meet Tim until high school (he had gone to a different elementary and middle school in my town) but it was no secret that Tim was a cancer survivor - he had brain cancer when he was in elementary school and sported a buzz cut all throughout high school that would accentuate this large scar (possibly scars?) on his scalp. A good number of kids in my high school went to elementary school with him and remembered him going through chemotherapy and would frequently tell anybody who didn't already know that Tim was a hero for beating pediatric cancer. Tim had achieved this cult hero status by high school and it was cool to be friends with, or friendly towards, Tim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI, on the other hand, was pretty unpopular. I wore hand-me-down clothes from my much-older brother and had really strict parents that didn't let me go out much, so I was socially awkward. I was nice (or I think I was?), so people generally left me alone, but it wasn't unheard of for people to openly bully me for being the weird guy. Tim decided to piggy-back on this general sentiment of making me a punching bag, and openly ridiculed me in front of his popular friends. In private, he started hitting me (main example I can think of was him hitting me pretty hard with weight room equipment - always when the PE teacher wasn't looking, so the teacher didn't believe me). He started picking on the few friends I had and even turned some of the friends I had against me, because it became cool to make fun of me because Tim did it. Being my former friends, I had confided some embarrassing information to them and they therefore had even more fuel to add to the fire. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of my best friends, Sarah, stood by me and quietly endured the insults he lobbed at both me and her until our junior year of high school, when her mom died. Her dad took her out of school for a month because it really shattered her world. During that month, Tim continued to taunt me and would say really messed up stuff, like asking me if I missed my friend, who was at home missing her dead mom. Sarah finally came back to school and it was pretty clear that she was still going through a rough patch. Tim saw her distress and asked her if \"she missed her mommy\", then cackled with laughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally snapped and socked Tim so hard in the face that he fell backwards onto his back. He started crying and ran and told the teachers that I had punched him. I got sent to the principal's office. The principal called my mom and told her that I had \"punched a pediatric cancer survivor\" in the face and that she needed to come get me because I was going to be on a one week suspension while the district considered expelling me from school. My mom was pissed off at me because she had to take unpaid time off work to get me (remember, poor family), and all the teachers/principal/classmates told me I was an asshole for hitting someone who survived cancer. Tim's mom came in screeching at my mom about how I probably gave her son a concussion, and a condition for my eventual return to the school was to write him an apology for hitting him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr My high school bully, who survived pediatric brain cancer, bullied me and my friends for years.

The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \n\nEdit: Could I have given him more points? Sure. Why did I give him a 7? Just to make sure that the other judges wouldn't make him win. \n\nEdit2: Damn, so many of you 'calling me out' for making this up. Well I don't know what to tell you, I have just had terrible luck my entire life. I feel like I'm living Larry David from Curb Your Enthusiasm's life. Believe me, don't believe me, I don't care.

I was relatively new to drinking, having only had my first alcoholic beverage 4 months previous, and only having drunk a handful of times since then. I'd never been seriously drunk. She was an experienced drinker who drank several times a week (because college I guess) She asked me to bring a bottle of tequila, limes and salt, which I got from another friend.\nI'd also recently had a breakup, like 2 months previous, with a girl that I'd swore up and down was my soulmate, having dated for 2 years up to that point. the ex was the only person I'd had sex with at the time. My friend, we'll call her Sara, had helped me get through it. We'd been friends for (I think) 7 years. It's hard to remember exactly how long because I have terrible memory for a lot of my childhood/adolescence. We'd always had a lot of fun together- we made each other laugh more than anyone else I've spent time with, and she helped me with a lot of personal problems. (We'd never considered a romantic or sexual relationship up to this point, though)\n\n\nWhen I first got there, Sara's friend, we'll call her Amanda, was also there, but wasn't going to drink. Sara and I did a couple shots while shooting the shit, talking about dumb stuff that people make small talk about. When Sara invited me, she said said she'd make dinner but when I got there she just wanted to start drinking. Amanda left after about an hour and we started watching New Girl on her couch. She wanted to do shots, so I did more with her. In the course of just 4 episodes+the time that Amanda was there, I personally had done 7 shots. I think she did 5. I'm a 200 pound guy and she's a 160 pound girl, just to give an idea of how drunk we were.\nIt had been a really long day for me, so I kinda leaned on her while we watched NG, and at some point I fell asleep. We had always been pretty comfortable with consensual touching like hugs and light cuddling etc (but nothing sexual)  so I don't feel this was inappropriate of me. I guess she kept watching New Girl, but I woke with my head on her lap and her hand in my pants. Being very drunk, I took this as a sign that she wanted to get frisky. So I sat up and we sloppily made out. Since her hands were all up in my business, I assumed that reciprocating would be okay, and clumsily tried to start fingering her. She grabbed my hand and pulled it away, but kept making out with me. I thought she was teasing me, as she was still playing with my bits, so I tried to do it again a few minutes later. She pulled my hand away again and kept laughing at me. I'm really confused at this point. Does she want to have sex with me or not? So I kept kissing her, and she kept kissing me. I should mention she was biting and sucking my neck, which left EIGHTTEEN different hickeys (yes, I counted the next day. I was absolutely humiliated at work). After a while, she says \"I can't have sex with you Jared\", so I stop kissing her, stumble over to another room, and fall asleep on the floor.\nThe next day, everything seemed fine when I woke up except I had the worst hangover I'd had up to that point or ever since, so I woke her up. she kicked me out as soon as she woke up. \nWe didn't talk for a long time. We had one short conversation a year later over text where everything seemed fine. But whenever I've seen her around, she gives me a nasty look then ignores me. I regret this event deeply- it ruined a strong friendship that I'd had for a long time. It's also ruined friendships with mutual friends that we had, one of which thinks I tried to rape Sara and won't even listen to my side of the story.AM I the asshole for trying to have sex with Sara?",

        "post_body": "Happened about 2 months ago, but still bothers me how everything turned out: \n\nI'm an ER doctor who works occasionally at a pediatric ER locally. I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. ",

        "post_body": "So I was eating alone at a coffee shop the other night. Please note that I am generally a reserved and quiet person who always minds my own business, but I am very observant of my surroundings. I was on my laptop, wearing earphones, and doing some work. After about 20 minutes, I noticed a family enter the coffee shop. Both the mom and the dad looked like they were in their mid-30s, while the kid looked  like he was no more than 10 years old. I actually even smiled at them when they got in. Not to be judgmental, but I kinda got the vibe that the dad was a prick because he lightly shoved the kid when they sat on the table.\n\nThe problem started when the parents left their kid at the table while they were ordering. The kid straight up unplugged my earphones from the jack violently and pulled the entire thing from me. I simply smiled, and politely told him \"Hey kid, I kinda need my earphones for work.\" He then threw it at me. I shrugged it off, suspecting he may be on the autism spectrum (not sure about the politically correct term).\n\nI never meant to eavesdrop on them, but I heard the mom and dad arguing about serious stuff (I heard the mom accusing the dad of cheating on her). It was one of those room voice arguments coupled with big hand gestures so you know it's intense.\n\nThe whole time, the kid was playing in front of my table. I was trying really hard to ignore them so I could focus on my work, but then he spilled his drink on my phone and laptop. I was sure the dad saw it, but he just gave a smug smile. I then turned to him and said, \"Sir, your kid spilled his drink on my laptop.\" I was then shocked because instead of apologizing, he even laughed and said, \"Yeah? Well dry it with a napkin.\" The mom did not say anything, but also had a smug smile.\n\nThis really angered me because I could have lost all the work I was doing. I approached the manager and told her about the incident. She then asked the family to leave (the kid was crying nonstop at this point). The dad argued with her and gave me the finger, but then I was also so angry that I cursed back at him. The mom even called me a jerk for having a kid with autism kicked out (that was the first time I confirmed he has autism). The kid then tried to come near me (I think to apologize), but the dad dragged him back. I even got up and did a slow clap while they were leaving.\n\nIn retrospect though, I felt really bad for the kid for being stuck with such parents. So, AITA in this situation?\n\nEDIT: Wow thanks for your insights! A lot of people called me out for the slow clap, and I agree with them. It was uncalled for and wrong of me to do. I just felt like the parents were ganging up on me and I was really upset and worried for my phone and laptop. Still, I shouldn't have done that.\n\nEDIT2: English is not the primary language in my country, so I obviously translated our words.",

I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat...

I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there.

So that\u2019s the situation. \n\nI was raised to believe abortion is wrong, although I did consider it anyway. In the end, I couldn\u2019t go through with it. I\u2019m 18 now and started college in August. I live at home. My mother hasn\u2019t worked in years (my dad supports the household on one income) and she\u2019s currently watching my child while I\u2019m at school.

        "post_body": "So I just had a very infuriating conversation with my mother this morning about how she will start punishing me for not taking my brother to school, even if it makes me late. So let me explain a little bit:\n\nMy brother takes the bus every morning and that bus comes to his bus stop around 7:15am every morning. He has a tendency to miss the bus due to him being very slow to get ready in the morning. Now we live around 3 minutes from the school, but it easily adds up to 5 or even 10 minutes because of the awful traffic that we encounter when getting to school. So the latest we can leave without either of us being late is around 7:20 because the middle school (my brother) and the high school (me) that we respectively go to are across the street from each other. I park fairly far away from the entrance to my school so it\u2019s another 7-10 minute walk to get to my class from my car. So if I leave around 7:20 with my brother, I am able to drop him off at around 7:25, and then I get to my spot around 7:28. And then I finally get to my class around 3 minutes before the bell rings (class starts around 7:40). \n\nSo this morning it was around 7:25 before I even leave the house so I don\u2019t have enough time to take him to school and also not making me late. So I had to leave the house. Then I get a few very pissed off texts from my mother saying how I should have waited around for my brother and taken him to school, even if it made me late to class. \n\nSo I am wondering if I am being an asshole by not waiting for my brother to leave the house, even if it causes me to be late to class? Obviously if we can both make it on time, then I would be more than happy to take him, but it seems like I have to sacrifice my attendance for him being so slow getting ready in the morning.\n\nSo am I the asshole?\n",

While that's possible, I wouldn't put much stock into that theory unless it makes sense within the context of your relationship.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold.

I harbour such a dislike for this man it\u2019s unreal, here\u2019s a few reasons why: he\u2019s alluded to a threesome between me, my cousin and him (This was a few months ago my cousin was 17 and I was 16), he already has two kids that are almost my age, he does drugs and has tried to pressure me into doing them at his place, he\u2019s living at his parents house as he gambles away all his money, he has threatened to murder me before if I ever hurt my cousin and there\u2019s even more than I can\u2019t list. \n\nSo anyway, my mum invited my cousins family round as usual and she said that my cousins boyfriend could come too (baring in mind she doesn\u2019t know half of the stuff he does) and he\u2019s coming round now.

However , the current opinion of the family is that it\u2019s better just not to get involved as my cousin is considered an adult now. Also, the question was more about AITA for falling out with my cousin about this and maybe a little less about AITA for not wanting him there. Also I should point out that he is outwardly a really friendly guy, which fuels my guilt about the situation because his actions suggest he\u2019s a scumbag but he is a generally friendly, outgoing guy (I\u2019m not sure this would sway anyone\u2019s argument though I just forgot to mention it in the original post)* ",

My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\n**Edit:**\n\n*So I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting this post to get this much attention. I\u2019ve actually cried reading some of the comments. I wasn\u2019t expecting people to go out of their way to offer resources and support to a complete stranger, so that\u2019s really humbling. I\u2019m doing my best to read everything you all write.*\n\n*For those asking, my son is seeing a child cognitive behavior therapist on a weekly basis. We were advised by another doctor that the cognitive behavioral therapy would be a good long term option. We are re-evaluating that advice now for obvious reasons. The problem is that it\u2019s very difficult to find someone qualified to deal with intense behavioral disorders in a child my son\u2019s age and we were lucky to find the person we did. Relocation is an option (although we would lose most of the family support we have here, which has been one of the only things keeping us going).*\n\n*As far as meds go, he\u2019s no longer taking anything except for a mild sedative to make him sleep. That\u2019s a long story. In short, he was misdiagnosed with ADHD and early onset bipolar disorder and given meds he shouldn\u2019t have been given. So now it\u2019s just the sleep aid.*",

        "post_body": "So here's what happened, at least from my point of view. I go to my hall's bathroom to take a shower a week or so ago, and one of my hallmates comes out right as I am about to go in saying that there is a drunk girl passed out in one of the stalls. My immediate thought is that she's probably drunk. I go back to my room and put my shower supplies away and then join my hallmate in the bathroom trying to rouse the girl (who was on the floor with her head on the toilet seat). We decide to call the RA on duty, as the girl hadn't responded to us talking to her under the stall door. It was actually my hallmate who called the RA, since she had her phone with her. We can see that she is breathing, but she hadn't said anything in the few minutes we'd been in there. The RA shows up, shoos us out, and I take my shower in a different bathroom. When I get back to my room, my roommate reports hearing a struggle going past our door and multiple people saying things like, \"Let me go!\" and \"I don't want to hurt you.\" I was pretty sure that the RA had called the police or something and had bathroom girl taken away. \n\nI felt like I had done the right thing. Sure she hadn't been disturbing anything by being passed out with her face on the toilet, but I was still concerned that she could be in trouble as she wasn't responding. \n\nNow comes what happened today. I'm washing my hands in the bathroom and the bathroom girl comes in about to take a shower. I don't recognize her at first (I'm bad with faces/names) and try to make small talk, asking her if she's going to bed soon. She answers that she is just taking a shower, but asks me why I thought she was really passed out drunk on the toilet. I told her that she wasn't responding to us trying to talk to her, so we wanted to play it safe and call the RA. If she wasn't passed out, the she should have been able to respond to us somehow. She then tells me that it had really messed up her life and that she can take care of herself. I didn't really have a response to that except that I didn't want someone in our hall to die of alcohol poisoning. She asked if I had known anyone who had that happen and I answered truthfully that I hadn't, but knew plenty of stories where that did happen. Then she says that if I really want to be an RA next year then I should think twice about it. I tell her quickly that I don't want to be one next year. (It was incidents like this that scared me away from the job, I hate confrontation.) After that I leave and go to a different restroom to calm down and wash the tears off my face  (like I said, I hate confrontation). \n\nI assume that she got in trouble with the campus police and probably got a mark against her from the college about being drunk in the dorms. I admit, it probably did mess up her life a bit. I felt at the time it was the right thing to do since she wasn't responding and seemed to be passed out, but now I'm conflicted. \n\nAITA for calling the RA on this girl?

OkCupid is an inclusive environment where transgender and nonbinary people may express themselves however they\u2019d like. Some people may not conform to how you personally view the gender(s) you\u2019re searching for.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but I think that\u2019s bullshit. I can filter by race, religion, height, body shape, etc - but not gender? It\u2019s ok for someone to decide they don\u2019t want to be matched with someone black, or republican, or under six feet (all choices that could be \u201ccontroversial \u201c), but there\u2019s no way to filter for trans. I get it. They\u2019re saying people are allowed to identify however they want - but I feel like there\u2019s a bigger issue not being addressed - your right to be attracted to who you are attracted to. I\u2019m not interested in dating a trans person and that\u2019s ok. I\u2019m fat. There\u2019s plenty of people turned off by that, and that\u2019s ok. But I feel like this is some PC bullying bullshit. \n\nAnd what a waste of time! I guess I could post a doctored photo that makes me look svelte, but nobody would be fooled once they saw me in person. And being vague about gender is both a shitty thing to do and can be dangerous (plenty of male-to-female people have been victims of violence because of this). \n\n It also seems like a poor business decision. If a dating app becomes so inclusive that there are no filters, you lose functionality. Imagine not being able to choose gender at all? Or age (don\u2019t want to be ageist!). Eventually your just in a huge pool of people. Then what\u2019s the point?\n\nSo? Am I the asshole for just wanting my matches to be the gender I prefer?",

        "post_body": "My mother passed earlier in the year after a long bout with breast cancer. For about the last 8 or so months before her passing, I decided to leave my job as a HS teacher and take care of her. I have a house with my husband and daughter: I spent nights there, but days with my mom (alongside my husband and daughter did the opportunity arise). I was the one who found my mother. \n\nI was a teacher for 4 years when I resigned, and finding a teaching position local is extremely difficult; generally you wait for years for a local opening, although positions open up in neighboring cities frequent enough. I knew this beforehand and had no problem since it's, well, my mom.\n\nAfter the estate paid her mortgage as well as other outstanding debts, I learned the remainder was left to breast cancer charity. Additionally, in her will were instructions to sell her house and pay that money forward to charity, too. Nothing was left to my family or anyone else for that matter. Nothing to her granddaughter. To note, a lawyer was executor of the will although my family was present at the reading. I'm not responsible for any of the work involved, including selling the house.\n\nAITA for being upset with this outcome? While I knew full well what I was doing by leaving my job, and I did it with no expectations of reimbursement, I never would have imagined an outcome like this. I had just assumed I would get everything from my mother when she passed, like it seemed obvious that's how families function when one passes. \n\nWe're not destitute by any means, but I have a mortgage myself. My husband makes more than enough to support us and my working was half to keep a comfortable safety cushion and honestly, partially out of boredom. We never needed the money, but I just anticipated an outcome other than this.\n\nEdit: Just so there's more info, I have one brother. I haven't seen or spoken to him in maybe 15 years, he's not on Facebook or anything, or if he is, he's blocked us all. Suffice to say we're not on good terms and AFAIK he's not aware our mother passed. He's been basically excommunicated from our family due to decisions he's made (theft, assault, drugs, etc).\n\nMy mother was divorced and was not seeing anyone new. My father passed years ago and didn't have any kind of leftover assets after bills, etc were paid.\n\nI was told in passing maybe a decade ago, prior to marriage and having a child, that I'd be inheriting everything, since when my grandparents passed, they left us (my brother and I) a small $10,000 inheritance, all of which my brother \"wasted\". His money to do what he wanted, but my mother didn't appreciate how he spent it foolishly. It was a more a dig at my brother than any kind of serious talk. We never talked financials or plans after death or anything. It's my fault for not being proactive but it was a touchy subject I guess.\n\nEdit2: I rewrote the post with more detail.

It was after dark by the time I was done and the parking lot for this restaurant is poorly lit and the lanes are only one car width wide. Basically, it's one way through the lot entrance to exit, with a small side lot behind the restaurant that you can circle.\n\nI was leaving the parking lot and drove towards the exit. A car was stopped in the lane, blocking the way out. The reverse lights then came on and the car started backing up. I honked and it stopped, but was still in reverse. There was a parking space that it looks like he wanted to get into, but he'd gone too far forward. He didn't have to backup to get to it, he just had to drive about 10 more feet and turn left to get to the spot from the other side, since you could park from front or back in this single row of spots. \n\nSo, we sat like this for a few minutes. Him in reverse, not moving, and me in drive, not moving. It was pretty obvious he wanted me to back up to let him in the space, but in order to do that I would have had to back up in a dark lot in a narrow lane -- not straight back, but around a curve. I didn't want to do this and risk hitting anything or anyone. The lot was pretty crowded and there were people  going to their cars.\n\nI got out of the car and pointed to where he needed to turn to come at the space from the other side. He said I should just back up so he could get the spot. I said that I didn't want to back up, that I wanted to continue driving forward. I don't know why I used such odd phrasing, that's just what came out of my mouth. We were both visibly annoyed, but civil. \n\nI got back in my car and waited. A couple of minutes later, he moved out of the way and I left the lot.\n\nFWIW, there were no cars behind me. I could have backed up, and might have done so if it were daylight or the parking lot was better lit, but it was too dark.  ",

It's a tradition for us. At the production last night (nutcracker) there was a small family seated next to us. The hall in which the event took place wasn't very well heated and because of recent terrorist threats no coats or bags were allowed inside. \n\nSo we all sit in the freezing hall and the family gets next to us. They consist of a mother, father, older kid daughter and a very, very sick baby. The baby was so young that it didn't even have its own seat, it was always handled from parent to parent during the play. \n\nAnyways: during the whole first act the child cried and cried and coughed without pause. Moreso: once the rat king in his terrifying costume showed up he got really upset and started screaming. The mother did not leave the hall with him but instead calmed him down (very loudly), earning a lot of annoyed looks from the other guests. The whole first act was ruined for us because the baby's cries prevented us from enjoying the production. Once the break between first and second act started and the lights came back on I could see that the child's face was red and glowing and the hair on his head was so sweaty, it got stuck on his forehead, meaning the child definitely had a fever as the hall was freezing as mentioned before. I got over to the mother and asked her to leave the production since her child was obviously sick and upset and did not enjoy the ballet, which caused half of the hall to not enjoy the ballet either.\n\nShe got very very angry with me, saying that I should not question her parenting if I wasn't a parent myself and that it was none of my business how she took care of her child. The father came over and scolded me as well, saying that I was rude for constantly giving them dirty looks during the production. A third, not related older woman also told me that I had no right to ask them to leave since they payed their tickets just like I did. \n\nI once again told them that a sweating, coughing baby does not belong into a freezing hall but should instead go lie down in a bed and that it was rude to the dancers to have the attention taken away from them because half the hall had to be annoyed by their crying coughing child.\n\nThe second act was just like the first with the exception that the child got very upset again and did not want to sit still anymore. The father then actually did decide to take him home. The mother touched my shoulder and very loudly and very rudely asked me if I was happy now and that I had ruined their first ballet production as a family.\n\nAITA for wanting to enjoy a family tradition that we payed a lot of money for in peace??

        "post_body": "A more accurate title would be: Am I The Homophobe. So here\u2019s my situation; \n\nI\u2019m an indie film Writer/Director, based in Australia. Myself and my crew have recently completed a short film, and have just launched our festival run. For this film, I was the Writer as well as Co-Director (important). It\u2019s also worth note that our crew is full of very close friends, and there was no negativity or tension on-set.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m a straight male. My Co-Director is female, and currently in a serious relationship with a woman. My Producer (male) is gay, and engaged to his partner. And my Assistant Director identifies as a lesbian. The four of us have the say on where the film is entered, festival wise.\n\nWithin the crew of roughly 20 people, I\u2019d estimate that 6ish people openly identify as LGBTQ+. Like I said above, I\u2019m the only person in one of the executive roles that is straight. \n\nThere\u2019s a particular festival that caught the other threes eyes when we were shortlisting. The festival is specifically for LGBTQ+ films or filmmakers. One of the entry rules is that your film must have some kind of LGBTQ+ themes/context OR you as a filmmaker must identify as LGBTQ+. Our film has absolutely nothing in it relating to the LGBTQ+ community, and this fact is something that all four of us agree on.\n\nSo the only way we\u2019d be accepted, is if the key people identify as LGBTQ+. The problem is I don\u2019t. Now the other three are fairly keen on the idea of entering the festival, but my concern would be that I\u2019d either be assumed by the festival organisers/audience/media to be LGBTQ+ or that I\u2019d be excluded from receiving awards, based on my sexuality. If my Co-Director were to win awards for OUR role in the film, and I wasn\u2019t eligible, I feel like that\u2019s somewhat discriminatory. Obviously this doesn\u2019t sit well with me.\n\nSo AITA for opposing entering the festival? Should I support something that I can\u2019t really be apart of?\n\nEDIT: I feel like a bunch of you guys all made super valid points, so thanks for the constructive conversation! As for the people calling me transphobic or comparing LGBTQ+ to terrorist groups, you\u2019re fucking idiots.\n\nJust for clarification, my concern about being labelled gay was two fold. 1-I\u2019m straight and I don\u2019t want my identity to be misrepresented (but this happens to people all the time and I can live with this). 2- more importantly, I don\u2019t want to receive huge, potentially career ending backlash for jointly winning an award meant for LGBTQ+ people\u2019s only, when I\u2019m a straight guy. \u201cStraight man lies about sexuality, steals awards from the LGBTQ+\u201d is what I\u2019d be afraid of, all because I wasn\u2019t clear about my sexuality. \n\nUltimately the best answers you guys gave was to check with the organisers if I can legitimately accept an award with my colleges, should we win anything. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being selfish for wanting recognition for the work I did, and I wouldn\u2019t want to enter festivals where my colleagues/friends couldn\u2019t accept awards for the work they did, based of their sexualities. \n\nAgain thanks to the people who commented who could have a civil discussion about a fairly divisive topic. \n\n",

He told me I was everything he wanted in a partner, which I found sweet but he froze up when I told him I loved how safe he was. He got unusually serious and asked me what I meant by that. I explained that in my teens and early twenties I had a habit of choosing guys who were fun and passionate but really unpredictable - like the bad-boy type or athletes, but now I was getting older I wanted someone who would be a good father, have a good steady job, and would get along with my family. He seemed to take this as an insult and asked \"exactly how many men have I been with\"? I told him it was none of his business and then he started throwing a list of questions like \"Do you even find me attractive\", \"How long have you felt this way\", etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese questions were insulting and he was being a dick but after arguing about this for half an hour, I gave him the whole summary that he should not be jealous of my previous relationships, he had no right to pry into my past, that I do find him attractive for his qualities not necessarily his looks, and that he should be proud that he's the first guy I was with that ever met my parents. This seemed to make him more upset and then he had the audacity to ask him if he was first \"Asian guy\" I've ever dated (we're both Asian). I told him the truth, that yes he was, but that it meant nothing. He suddenly stormed out of the living and shouted that I'm using him as a safety net to please my family. The truth is  my family is strict and conservative, so yes I wouldn't bring home anyone who wasn't Asian, but in the heat of argument I told him that's not true and he didn't believe me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe packed a bag and told me he was going to be staying with a friend for a few days before slamming the main door. I still don't understand why he's so insulted and I'm pissed off at him for asking all these prodding questions about my past.

So when you said he \"should be proud that he's the first guy I was with that ever met my parents\" what you really mean is that he \"should be proud that he's Asian\".\n\nHonestly, you fucked this one up pretty hard.  You may not have meant to, but you've essentially told him that you don't think he's attractive or passionate or fun, but that you like him because he's someone with a steady job who's Asian (two things that are *what* he is, but not **who** he is).  That probably felt super objectifying to him, and made him feel like you just see him as a means to an end, and not as a person."

Flash forward about six month, during casual conversation I mention an actor that I found attractive - she agreed, one thing led to another and she admitted that over the past few months she had realized she was bi.

She is driven and one of the most determined people that I know of, and I could never tell her how I feel. I hear about how all these artists come out of school and are unable to find work. She has these dreams of coming out school and being able to say she could support herself if she wanted to doing her art. The thing is... she isn't that good. Our friend group is mainly graduated artists that are so much more talented than she is, have gone to a top 3 art school, and still they can not find work. Most of them are still living with their parents 2-3 years out of college.\n\nLuckily I have a job that can support us both. The problem is, I'm no saint and I get really bitter about it at times. Never to her face. I'm the one who found us a house, got a decent paying job, will pay for both of our student loans, and will pretty much provide for us while she works for this degree that I believe will only put us in more debt and give us nothing. My fear is that she will come out of this intense years of art school, after putting years of long distance stress on our relationship, with nothing. I try and will always tell her that I support her choices, but watching our debt increase and knowing i'm going to be the one to pay it back is really stressing me out. Especially when I 100% believe she will not be making any substantial amount of money to help pay it back.

        "title": "AITA for moving someones car who illegally blocked me in my private property parking space?",
        "post_body": "I live in an apartment building [which has tandem parking with two spaces per per apartment](https://i.imgur.com/EVJncQ3.png), and access to the parking levels (1-5) are done via a locked automatic roller door which people can only get through if they have a remote for it (or sneak through behind someone else). I only have a single car, and sometimes I let my friends park in the space in front of my car if they give me notice, so I generally park at the back of the double space (plus it's easier for my neighbours who have two cars).\n\nEarlier this year a random car began parking in front of mine on Friday afternoons, meaning I couldn't go out with my car on Friday nights, annoying, but not the biggest issue when you live super close to the city. This continued nearly every week over about 5 weeks when I didn't park my car at the front of the bay (which I began doing), but times I planned to leave the space free for friends coming over or whatever, the car appeared again. I made repeated attempts to stop this behaviour by leaving notes, which escalated into leaving print outs of a photo of the car with the license plate clearly visible and an explanation that if it happened again I'd press charges and/or have the vehicle towed.\n\nIt happened again and this time it was still there Saturday afternoon when I had been planning on going away with a group of my mates. My guess is, someone went out on Friday, got drunk, and decided to pick up the car \"later\", not concerning themselves with the inconvenience it caused anyone else. It clearly hadn't moved, as my aggressive note telling them to fuck off was still there sitting limply under their wiper blades.\n\nI figured enough was enough, it was time to have the vehicle towed, so I called building management and eventually calling a towing company, who refused to help because the space was on the third floor, and they can't get any trucks up to that level because of the height and space restrictions. I had previously called the police when other vehicles had blocked me in and the response was some variation of \"Unless it's been there for long enough to be considered abandoned there's nothing they can do, however I am welcome to have it removed sooner.\".\n\nFortunately for me however, my parents only live 30 minutes away, and have a garage where I work on one of my cars that's getting at the tail end of a minor restoration. One of the things I use pretty often is a set of [Vehicle Positioning Jacks](https://www.kincrome.com.au/vehicle-posi-jack-300mm-5pc), to jam my project car right up against the wall of the garage to minimize the space it takes up. [For anyone that doesn't know, Vehicle Positioning Jacks are basically devices that slot under each wheel, then lift the car up on hydraulics so you can free wheel it in any direction.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=its2Kh-HKi8) Whilst I hadn't originally gone to retrieve them, when I had to take my project car off them, a bright idea came to my head.\n\nNone of my mates minded spending an extra hour to screw someone over that had interfered with us, so we grabbed the jacks, and went back, propped the car up, and wheeled it out. Six guys can easily move around a small hatchback, so we pushed across the level slowly and carefully, to an area where there isn't parking, but is a load supporting pillar with space enough for a car behind it, in a little section of the garage where it isn't lit and is completely out of the way. Typically there's a guy on my level that parks a motor bike there, but he isn't meant to, and I doubted he minded. We dumped it between the pillar and the wall, with the nose pointing towards the wall, I took back my angry note, the jacks, and we left to enjoy our weekend. [This is how the car ended up positioned.](https://i.imgur.com/x7S2B2T.gifv)\n\nWhen he came back Monday afternoon after the long weekend the car was still there, which was no real surprise considering there was only about a foot of space for movement between the pillar and car, and another foot or so between the car and the wall. From the fact the front wheels had changed we're guessing they did try to get it out, unsuccessfully. It eventually went later in the week, though I'm not exactly sure how they managed it.\n\nAm I the asshole for moving his car away from mine, and putting it in a position where it wouldn't inconvenience anyone else?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**TL;DR:** Jackass repeatedly blocked in my car by illegally parking in my private space, including over a long weekend when I had plans to go away  with a group of mates. We used vehicle positioning jacks to move the car and place it between a pillar and a wall making it extremely hard to  get out, from a secluded, dark and out of the way corner of the parking  level where most people wouldn't have thought to look but also didn't significantly impact any other tenant. AITA?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEdit: To avoid me having to repeat this, I am the [original poster of this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/a2xvqf/repeatedly_block_in_my_car_in_private_parking/) where you may have seen it in r/ProRevenge.

He said the other guys bought it for him and he was super drunk, and that he was sorry. He also said he got up after a minute and she didn't finish the dance. I appreciate that he told me the truth, but I'm still really mad that he disrespected that boundary after agreeing to it. He didn't have to accept the dance, he could have stood up and left.

We never got along until recent years, and it\u2019s still a bit rocky due to him being an \u201cex\u201d drug addict, and now an alcoholic. \n\n6 months ago he totaled his truck, due to reasons unknown to us, he says the brakes were going out and finally quit when he was taking a corner. At the same time, I had gotten a real good deal on a car at the dealership I go to, but I already had a car loan and didn\u2019t really want to take on the extra payments.  I was talking to him about it a few days after his crash, he said he really needed a new car, and offered to take over my payments and I could get the new car. \n\nNow, at this point I DID have enough money to cover both, and I know he isn\u2019t as financially stable or able as I. I considered the deal, and eventually accepted. Under the preface that if he ever got into financial trouble, to let me know before anything, because I could handle paying the payment on both cars for a few months if absolutely necessary.  He told me he was all good, working more than usual, and earning more spending money. \n\nFast forward to last week, my other brother called to ask if I check out original brothers new car yet? Wtf? Call him up, says he ended up getting his girlfriends grandparents to give him a down payment and cosignature on a brand new truck. Ok cool, but whatabout the payments on the car I gave him? \n\nTurns out, according to my original loaners, he hadn\u2019t made a single payment since I gave him the car, and was $1700 in the hole, they were sending it to collections and attempting to repossess it unless I got them $1500 up front. Now, the money isn\u2019t a big deal to me. I put up the money to cover it, and the other brother wants it, but that\u2019s a story for another day. \n\nThe issue for me, is I am so close to being married, buying my first house, and starting my life, and he had no issue with letting my credit get rocked for the $8000 left on the car and not saying anything to me about it. He was 100% willing to continue on with letting the car get repossessed without even calling or sending a warning text to me. \n\nI\u2019ve lost all respect and trust for the kid, I\u2019m definitely not allowing him to be a groomsman anymore, which sucks, because I thought it would help us bond, but I\u2019m also considering just not inviting him whatsoever. \n\nSo, reddit, AITA or would I be for not inviting him, or making him a groomsman? \n\nEdit: just wanted to add the fact that I was able to save this from impacting my credit, as its in-house and they never reported, and I talked with the lot owner to make sure it doesn\u2019t go into collections. \n\nBad decision on my end credit wise, but I came out of it so far unscathed. \n\nEdit 2: Thanks for all of the insight everyone. I think I\u2019ll allow him to show up (if he can afford to drive here without me helping) just no involvement in the wedding. \n\nAlso, this wasn\u2019t about money, but more about trust. ",

Because he works so much, his 2 cats and his dog are here in his room alone A LOT. the cats are typically fine, but his dog is young and in a kennel.

I just have to figure out if he's gonna be home or not and deal with his dog accordingly - such was the case this morning. He should have been off work this morning and home by about 8 to let his dog out. He never showed. When I finished working I realized he wasn't home and texted him if I needed to let the dog out. He said he forgot to text me and ask.  No problem... except it's getting to be a problem. I go down to let his dog out... his cats dont have food or water.

I have tried foreplay, sometimes for hours. It doesn\u2019t seem to help. \n\nThing is though, whenever she drinks, she\u2019s totally fine with penetration. She\u2019ll even get on top and ride me, which is just not a thing if she\u2019s sober. I\u2019m starting to feel bad.

        "post_body": "So my friend I have known since kindergarten ( I\u2019m almost 40) married my wife\u2019s sister. Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\nEdit: I really don\u2019t feel like the Asshole. I just wanted to bounce this off a bunch of people to see if the creepy feels are justified.  \n\nEdit2: Clarifications and additional detail.  My wife is fully on board with him not seeing our daughter she just hates losing her sister. \n\nBIL and SIS in law  will have their first child in A few months. \n\nYes I think there are developing mental issues with BIL. Depression seems most likely but it\u2019s no excuse for the strange behavior. \n\nHe also has been very standoffish to me and my wife lately. \n\nBIL also didn\u2019t want to have a girl because he didn\u2019t want it to take away from his love for my daughter. SIL actually told me this like it was so sweet and endearing. I feel sick writing this. \n\nOh ya. I was tactful and calm when talking to him.  I might have been pushy at first but it\u2019s Hugh tension convo. I repeatedly ask why he did not see that it was wrong. He did not see anything wrong with his behavior. Annnnnnnd I recorded the conversation since it was such a serious discussion. No I will not share it for obvious reasons. \n\nEdit: thank you for the feedback. As a small\nMajority have pointed out it might be harmless (albeit still creepy) and I have thought about that.  It sure does suck for everyone involved if that\u2019s the case. The consequences of not addressing this and something actually bad happening , I could never forgive myself. \n\nFinal edit: Thank you again for the advice everyone. A lot of you shared your personal experiences with abuse to assure me I did the right thing and that in itself is not an easy thing to extend to a stranger. He\u2019s a creep any way you look at it. There have been a lot of questions asking for more details and I don\u2019t really want to write out more because this situation sucks. There is even more disturbing instances me and my wife drug back up today and look at them\nWith new clarity after reading your comments  ( I took off work today because I have been a basket case since speaking with him yesterday) from this year that are even worse. We are very confident this had not escalated to a physical stage yet. I wrote this around 4:00 in the morning laying awake(I apologize for the bad phrasing).  \n\nTo be clear, he will never be around my daughter again. \n\nThat\u2019s all I feel like sharing on this topic.

I get that--I'm crazy about my little nephews.  But when he purposefully waited until you were gone to sneak over to the MIL's to see her, that ramps up the creep factor.  If he *appears* to have an inappropriate infatuation with your three year old, you cut him off at the knees.  Period.  If his interest is purely innocent (like hell it is) then perhaps he should do a little self-evaluation to understand why his actions and behavior are suspicious.  Who cares if you're the asshole?

Being in a foreign country navigation can be a bit difficult. My girlfriend was adamant we had to catch the bus numbered 21 to our destination because she had seen it on a sign at the main bus depot. I suggested we call the bus provider and ask just to be certain. She was very anti this idea for reasons I cannot comprehend and was certain this was the bus we had to catch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to sneakily give the bus provider a ring as I was genuinely unsure if this was the right bus stop and I didn't want to end up going to the wrong place. Turns out the bus we needed was not number 21 but number 22! I said to my girlfriend we needed to catch the 22 not the 21 and \"luckily I checked\". I did not mean this in a nasty way but I must have sounded condescending. She replied with \"You're such a sexist pig\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was honestly shocked. I have never considered my self to be sexist and asked her to explain. She said I was a chauvinist because I would not have double checked if it had been one of my friends (presuming she meant male friends). I thought this was really unfair as I have always tried to treat her with respect, I have even moved across country for her to pursue her career. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was so upset by what she said I decided to treat her like a male friend for the remainder of the day. This started when we got on the bus with only one seat being available. Normally I would let here take the seat while I stood. Not today, I decided to grab the seat and let her stand which is what I would have done with a male friend. This continued for the rest of the day as I proceeded to not get the door for her, carry her coat etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it came to dinner I generally order and take care of the bill when we are on holiday. This time I decided to ask her to grab the bill as I had paid for dinner the previous night. I could see she was upset by this point but at the time I thought I should make my point. By the next day i had gone back to normal but I could tell she was upset by my behaviour the previous day. I didn't do anything nasty, I just treated her with equality as if she was my male friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for behaving this way?

Which is a pathetic cheap shot and is patently false, calling for bus information is in no way a gendered interaction.\n\nWhile I approve of the pettiness of \"well if you think this treatment is a double standard you are suffering from, let me remove all the double standards you demonstrably benefit from\" in that it is a good reality check/kick up the ass, you acted like a childish asshole by taking it too far and dragging it out through dinner etc. You should have made the point with the bus seats, and then had an adult conversation about the issue, and moved on.\n\nThat said, who the fuck takes issue with splitting dinner on holiday in a long term relationship?

Due to the circumstances I am unable to legally work for a couple months while we work on getting me my employment authorization document, adjustment of status, etc. I have a lot of time to myself since my husband often works long hours but I've been enjoying the time to re-immerse myself into old hobbies, volunteering, and re-decorating the house. It's very relaxed but I had a super-stressful job beforehand, and, coupled with the move, it's really nice to finally have a break.\n\nMy husband's sister has children (1.5y &amp; 3y) who are wonderful -- but who I suddenly felt expected to babysit whenever. Since I am not working currently his family seems to have the impression that I am just sleeping the days away or otherwise doing nothing -- which my husband and I have told them was not the case. A lot of times I would barely get any notice. Like maybe a text an hour or 2 before she's at my doorstep dropping off the kids. However I do not enjoy playing babysitter at all. I don't even want kids of my own and watching someone else's every other day is starting to drain me. \n\nMy husband and I talked it over and he agrees it's a bit much -- after all, watching the children cuts into our own personal time that we get together. So recently I've told his sister that, no, I wouldn't be around as an on demand babysitter anymore. Unless it was an emergency I wouldn't be available to watch her children every other day. This wasn't taken well by the family. In their view she's a struggling single mom and I'm just a lazy person who rather sit on my ass than help out family. I've put my foot down though. I've told them even though I am currently not working, I do have ways to spend my free time and do not want to spend that time babysitting. I have my husband's support but I still feel really bad for making things awkward for him with his family. Also despite feeling like I've been taken advantage of by the SIL I sympathize with her situation -- and his family are good people for the most part.  \n\nSo AITA for not wanting to babysit my SIL's children, even though I technically have the time and space to do so?",

My husband could no longer stomach our plans since his mother was supposed to be there. We cancelled them. He hasn\u2019t been in a good place mentally since. I realized a wedding reception wasn\u2019t going to happen, and I\u2019m okay with it. I\u2019m 30, I don\u2019t care.

I joke they\u2019d trade him for me, but I do know it\u2019s semi-true.\n\nI decided we should just tell them we eloped and get it over with, especially since my mother has been getting particularly cruel lately. Our relationship has always been strained, and she loved to call and tell me that my husband clearly didn\u2019t want to marry me anymore and he was going to dump me and take all our resources at any moment. She doesn\u2019t understand why it was hard for my husband to watch his mother die. Her only words of comfort to me were, \u201cAre you going to cry this much when I die? I hope you\u2019ll cry more.\u201d\n\nAnyway, we told my parents during Thanksgiving. My dad was PUMPED. He hates weddings and spent a lot of money on my brother and sister. My mom was very polite and upbeat, but I knew it was a sham. She has not spoken to me since. My husband sent her a handwritten letter apologizing (again) for the secrecy, and acknowledging that she was allowed to feel hurt, and we wanted to hear those feelings.\n\nWhen she\u2019s mad at one of her three children, she takes it out on the rest. She won\u2019t talk to my siblings either. She would do this stuff when I was a child, and my dad would force me to apologize over and over, even if I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. He said it didn\u2019t matter, but we had to appeal to her ego for family harmony to be restored.\n\nI\u2019m tired. I\u2019ve called almost daily to make her feel special. She won\u2019t call me back. I think I\u2019m done calling. My sister thinks I should keep calling her daily, like she has been. I\u2019m sure eventually she\u2019ll decide to stop \u201cpunishing\u201d me, but I don\u2019t really feel like enabling her manipulative actions anymore.

Maybe I'm wrong and just very sensitive to high people or something.  \n\nHe does get annoyed sometimes about frequency of sex since I will turn him down a lot of the time during the week since in the evening he has pretty much always smoked. I do explain its because he was smoking. I just really can't get in the mood if I've been trying to talk with a space cadet all evening before we go to bed.

        "title": "AITA for storming out of a family gathering because I'm tired of being used as tech support?",
        "post_body": "This post may be a bit long as the issue was the culmination of years of behavior that all came to a head the other night.\n\n**The Background**\n\nAt a very young age (about 8 or 9) I was already more tech savvy than anybody else in my family.  Shortly after this \"gift\" was discovered I became the go to person when anything computer related would have issues.  Now when I was a kid in the 90s and there were only a few computers between all my extended family this meant the occasional reboot, antivirus sweep, or OS reinstall a few times a year.  No big deal.  I was happy to help my family, and I was building a skillset that would land me a career in IT that I happen to enjoy very much.\n\nThe problems started about 8-10 years ago as more and more members of the family started getting computers, internet connections, and game consoles in all their homes.  Suddenly the standard greeting for my family was \"where is OP?  we've got some things we need him to look at while he's here.\"  So instead of joining in on the fun I would have a laptop, xbox, and a couple phones thrust into my arms as they went back into the other room to have fun.  As shitty as that sounds at that time in my life I still enjoyed learning about the tech and was still happy to help.  Just a bit less happy than before now that I was missing out on more of our family functions.\n\nSoon after this pattern began a few of my relatives started giving out my contact info to their friends and neighbors whenever they'd complain about some technical issue.  So I start getting texts and phonecalls several times a week from people who want me to drive out to their house and fix their stuff.  After a few times I actually started quoting rates for my services.  This caused some drama with a few of my relatives who claimed they were ashamed and embarrassed that I would dare try and charge for my time when all I did was \"hit a couple buttons and bam it works!\"  My response of \"if it is so easy then why don't you guys go do it?\" was met with silence for several weeks.\n\nAfter this I started to distance myself from these family gatherings and pushing back a bit on the tech support front by telling them they need to take it to a shop or something for more complicated issues.  This mean I would only be doing a few quick fixes and then I would join in on the party for the gatherings I chose to attend.  Sadly this was a temporary improvement as a few of my pushier relatives (the drama queens from the previous paragraph especially) demanded I take a closer look and \"stop being so lazy\" because they didn't want to pay a shop to look at their issues.  This was about 2 years ago and I simply told my parents I'd be going home and will no longer be coming to family events.  My father wasn't happy about it, but he seemed to understand and accepted my reasons.\n\n**On to the potential asshole event** \n\nFast forward to this weekend and my father is hounding me to go to an event at my grandfather's house.  It is my uncle's birthday and he specifically was asking if I'd be able to attend.  I was hesitant as I didn't want to deal with the drama from other attendees when I suddenly \"reappeared\" after 2 years.  Eventually they wore me down and I agreed to attend on the condition that I not be turned back into tech support for the day and simply left to enjoy the time with my family.  They both enthusiastically agreed so I went.\n\nHonestly the start of the party was great.  I got to see family that I had only briefly seen in the last 2 years, and I got to hang out with my grandfather and uncle both of whom are my favorite relatives to hang out with at these things.  I even got my uncle a couple bottles of his favorite beer that is pretty hard to find so he was pretty excited about that.\n\nUnfortunately this all came crashing down later in the evening when one of my drama queen aunt's was in a nearby room with my grandmother and a few of my female cousins.  I overheard the following said loudly enough that I know she knew I'd hear it.  \"Sure is a shame OP thinks he's too good to help his family with their computers now that he's a big shot IT nerd huh?  I brought my laptop just in case he decided to be an adult about this, but (my dad's name) said to just leave it in the car since he won't fix it.\"  (I know this isn't word for word since I lost some of it in my moment of rage, but it is pretty close I am fairly sure to what was said.  \"IT nerd\" was definitely used as that moment is burned into my memory now.)\n\nFull transparency here.  I lost my cool.  I know I should have just walked away, but I was seeing red here.  I stormed into the room and basically whisper yelled at her.  The basic breakdown because I only clearly remember the very end of my outburst here.\n\n\"I was this family's tech support bitch for almost a fucking decade.  It was fun when I was a kid, but after a few years of not getting to spend time with my family because you are too fucking dumb to take care of  your devices I was sick of it.  I was sick of you giving random people my number thinking I would spend my limited free time fixing their shit too.  I came out to spend time with (Uncle, and Grandfather) not to spend that time sitting in the garage working on your piece of shit laptop.  (Aunt) you are a massive entitled cunt, and I hope I never have to see your disgusting face ever again.\"  I then grabbed my things and went home ignoring the barrage of texts and calls I received for a few hours following my exit.\n\nThe aftermath is that though most of my family can sympathize with how I have been treated, and even got some apologies for past behavior...a good chunk of my family including my grandfather say I should apologize for the outburst even if I was in \"the right\" on it.  I disagree, but I am not really upset at them for thinking that.  I've been accused a few times of ruining my uncle's birthday which I apologized to him for.  And he seemed to accept the apology and still wants to hang out with me outside of family things so I am happy to hear that.\n\nProblem is I can't help this nagging feeling that I was way out of line for going off on her.  Like I know her behavior was shitty, but was my response a few steps too far?  Should I have just said a few quick goodbyes and gotten the hell out of there instead?  I honestly don't know now.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nSo I am getting a mix of NTA and ESH judgements and based on the responses here is where I am.  My aunt was definitely an asshole and I was an asshole for the harshness of the language I used, but not for being upset at the way she treated me and passive aggressively insulted me at the party.  I am officially no contact with the aunt and a few other relatives who were nasty to me, but if I were not I would apologize for my use of words like \"cunt\" in my anger.  I would not, however, apologize for getting angry and calling her out in front of the family for her behavior.\n\n**EDIT 2**\n\nI completely glossed over it in the OP, but when I say I \"Pushed back\" on tech support I mean a combination of telling them the problem would need to be looked at by a shop or the company as well as a few more polite discussions explaining that I was spending too much time doing repairs and not enough time actually hanging out with the family.  This had a short term improvement, but a few of the more aggressive relatives just went right back to it shortly after causing me to stop going to things because it wasn't worth the fight.  So yes aunt was made very well aware that I was unhappy with how many problems I was being expected to fix.",

        "post_body": " \n\nLittle background, I'm a 5th year senior who's graduating in December 20th (so like eight days). Me and three other fraternity brothers were taking a course together. This course was notified early on that there would be a group project worth 65% of our grade and that we should pick 1 - 2 partners accordingly. I asked one of brothers who I will call M to join my group since I know he's a smart person and we were friends. He agreed to be my partner and I thought that was the end of that. The project gets released a month later and it turns out M asked another fraternity brother to join our group and now it's a three person project. The projects difficulty scales according to how many people are in each group. I was surprised but he assured me it was no big deal and that we would be fine. Fast forward to a week before the deadline and zero progress had been made by the other two partners and I had done a fair amount of the starting work. Decided to hit them up and tell them we need to finish it as it's a large chunk of our grade. We meet up lets say on a monday and nothing was really done so I decided to go home and complete it on my own. I didn't end up completing it but luckily it got extended by three days. Great, I hit up my partners again and they both claimed they'd work on it again.... nothing had been done. The last day i'm scrambling to get even a 40% of the marks, but i did not finish. I e-mailed my professor after he had graded it (as i got a 20/100 originally). He emails all three of us to come to his office hours and to present the project, we all agreed today to go. But yet again the same theme, I'm the only one who went. I cannot possibly pass with a grade under a sixty ( The weight of the project is way too big), and I fail I would have to take another semester, pay thousands of dollars, and retake the course so I decided to tell him that I did the majority on my own and that I wanted it to be graded as a single person project instead of a three person. He ended up settling on giving me an eighty instead of a forty five.\n\nTLDR: Did entire project on my own, screwed over friends to save my grade and to graduate on time.\n\nThis happened earlier today and these guys are my friends (though not really that close). I feel really guilty but I did what I had to do in my opinion, my other two friends contributed nothing significant at all. They are younger and can retake the course without having to extend their educating. But I still feel guilty, I want to hear your opinions. AMTI?",

        "title": "AITA for lying about an allergy at a restaurant and ending up at the emergency room?",
        "post_body": "I met this girl on Tinder and we really hit it off. I asked her out on a date to a cozy restaurant in our small town (Gainesville, FL). \n\nI had to take the bus there (my moped broke down last week which is another story of its own) and she lived close the restaurant so it was convenient. \n\nThe date was going ok. It was kind of awkward at first because we just talked about the cold weather for 5 minutes -- so I decided to break the tension. A while ago, I heard about a life pro-tip where  if you order French fries at a restaurant  without salt, they have to make a fresh batch for you. I've been to this restaurant before and the guac is really good on some days and ok on other days. \n\nWhen the waitress came in, we ordered chips and guac. I then asked the waitress, \"Does the Guac have onions?\" To which she responded, \"Yes, it does\".  I then proceeded to tell her, \"I have an extremely severe allergy to onions, can we get guac with no onions?\" I told her I have an extremely severe allergy so she doesn't just take the guac they currently have and remove the onions; this forces them to make a fresh batch from scratch. After the waitress left, my date asked me, \"are you really allergic?\" To which I said \"no :D, but this way, we get fresh guac\". She was pretty impressed like \"damn, I'm stealing this one\". When the guac came in, I asked her to give us onions on the side for my date. \n\nThe rest of the date went well. We ordered some drinks first and then food later. What I forgot to do when I was ordering food was to tell her not to put any onions in my food. When I got my dish, I took about 2-3 bites and the waitress came running to me frantically saying that there are onions in the food!! She thought it was her fault for not mentioning it to the chefs. I didnt know how to react so I just kind of dropped the food from my mouth and into the plate. Her superior walks in during this time and he's asking if everything is ok so I tell him that I forgot to mention not to put onions and that I have a severe allergy. \n\nThe first thing the manager does is apologize profusely and then ask if he should call an ambulance.  \n\n(Side note: I don't have any allergies at all and neither does anyone in my family or any of my friends. I have no idea what a severe allergic response looks like, but I know that it like swells up your face and for some reason, I thought it makes you cough a lot, I don't know why I thought that.) \n\nCutscene to now: I start kind of coughing, but assure him that everything is going to be fine. I tell him, \"I barely got any onions in the bite\". My date at this time went from kind of giggling a bit (when the waitress came in) to just straight up serious after all the attention just turned to us. I told them not to worry about calling an ambulance, and that I'm okay enough to go to the emergency room myself. I asked for the check but they insisted on me not paying. (Not like we ate anyway) but I still left a $20 for the waitress and assured her and the manager that it was only my fault and not the waitresses fault at all. \n\nAfter leaving, my date was half-wtf and half-laughing at the stupidity of this whole thing. I shot my shot and asked her if she'd just like to grab pizza over at her place, but she said she has to study. Now it is important to note that the bus stop where I grab my bus to go home is RIGHT OPPOSITE THE RESTAURANT. I'm sitting there looking at cats fetching stuff on Reddit when the supervisor pulls up in his car at the stop. He thinks that I am taking the bus to the emergency room.  \n\nHe kept insisting that he drop me to the emergency room. He felt responsible and didnt want anything to happen to me. I finally gave up and told him , \"Okay\". In my head, I thought I'd just let him drop me there and then I'll take an uber back home. However, we get there AND HE WANTS TO COME IN TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OK.  I'm like hey man, trust me, IM OKAY. Nothing is going to happen to me. You can leave. It was so awkward. We were parked and he kept asking if I'm sure and I'm like yes I'm sure don't worry, please leave you dont have to come in with me. \n\nAt the end he said he'd just walk me in, use the restroom and leave. We walk in the emergency room and I'm the only person there. Great. I had to walk to the nurse and tell her that I might be having a slight allergic reaction. Supervisor uses the restroom and asks again if everything is fine and I'm like yes, everything is going to be okay. \"Thank you so much for everything.\" He gives me his number and tells me to inform him once I'm out. \n\nHere I am. A healthy 25 year old adult. Having to pay $500 to visit a fucking emergency room for no fucking reason: http://imgur.com/tfU3k5g\nAnother nurse came up to me to take my vitals and the doctor asked what was wrong and I had to sheepishly tell him, \"I think I might have been having an allergic reaction\". He says, \"Are you allergic to anything?\" And I go \"No\". \n\nHe gave me a benadryl and sent me out. I then spent another $25 to Uber home. I told what happened to my friend and she said I was the worst kind of asshole. I learned my lesson and will never pretend to have an allergy, but I don't think I was an asshole because I did try to avoid as much confrontation as possible, and even ensured the waitress and supervisor that it was all my fault.

        "post_body": "So for general context I am 22, and the cousins are 7, 9, and 11.  I live at home with my parents, and I pay rent.  My room upstairs is mine to do with as I please per agreement with my parents and it has a lock on it that only I have the key to.\n\nSo for the last several years my family hosts Thanksgiving and Christmas because we are pretty close to the halfway point for a lot of our relatives that live in different states so it makes sense for everyone to go here.  We have plenty of space and my mom loves hosting so it works out great.  The only issue I have is with 3 of my younger cousins who all see me as the \"cool\" older cousin.\n\nNow don't get me wrong.  I love these kids.  I love hanging out with them and playing games.  I even put my Switch in the shared living room so they could play Mario Kart and stuff with or without me.  The issue is that they also want to play with all the electronics in my room.  This includes my laptop which is used almost exclusively for work, and my PS4 which is not something I let other people play with.  \n\nWith past consoles I've kept in my room I used to just let them play to shut them up, but after a few hours I'd come back to saves erased, sticky controllers (Most from the younger 2.  Oldest is actually relatively well behaved.) and one time a broken TV because one of the kids tried to pull the console out of the TV stand and ended up bringing down the whole stand and TV with it.  Their parents paid for the TV to be replaced and nothing else was damaged so I am not mad about it, but I decided from then on I didn't want them in my room playing with my stuff.\n\nI brought this up with my parents, and they agree I have every right to lock up my room and keep the kids out, but they think it will cause drama with the kids and the parents making the kids feel unwanted and hurt their feelings.  I can see that point of view, and I definitely don't want to hurt their feelings.  The issue is after bringing up their destructive behavior my parents think its just \"kids being kids\" and that I need to accept that things are going to break.  They cite examples of things around the house that I broke when I was younger that they just accepted as well as things my cousins have damaged that they aren't mad about.  And even argue that my aunt and uncle are happy to pay for replacements if anything gets broken so why be mad about it?  This makes me feel a bit guilty honestly.\n\nNow my plan for avoiding the conflict is to wait until the day before they get here and take my PS4, Laptop, and anything else they would want to play with and hiding them in my trunk until they leave.  I could say that my laptop is in the shop for repairs, and my friend is borrowing my PS4.  That way I can leave my room open so we can hang out up there, but there isn't anything for them to play with so they will go back downstairs and maybe play the Switch.\n\nSo I guess what I am trying to figure out is is it shitty of me to hide things from these kids that they enjoy just so I can avoid potentially getting them dirty or damaged?  Should I hope that they are better behaved this time, or should I maybe instead just have a talk with their parents and set ground rules instead of this trick I'd be playing on all of them?  Is that the less assholish way to approach all this?",

Through my husband's job he had $300 worth of bonus credit that had to be spent before the end of the year, otherwise he would lose it. It had to be spent at this auction.\n\nSo we had $300 to blow. The auction stuff was mostly artsy crap. But Hubs spotted a 3D printer, unopened, and said \"I've seen this on Amazon for around $300 so it will probably go for less than that.

He said he was OK with not getting the printer but he was apparently lying.\n\nSo a week after this, my mom gave me a $200 Amazon gift card for Xmas.  I was looking for a gift for my sister. First thing that popped up on Amazon was a 3D printer for $170.\n\nI had already bought Hubs his present (a TV for his man cave in the garage, bought Black Friday so no returns).

I'm a bit stunned because this feels super insensitive considering the stress I'm already under, and is very unlike her. I know that I often don't help alleviate conflict, but in this case, I really don't think I'm in the wrong, so please correct me if I am.**\n\n\\----\n\nMy GF is British. I live in the UK with her, but I'm in Canada now where my family is from. I should mention that we BOTH have problems letting fights sometimes last longer than they should and allowing things to escalate.\n\nMy mom was battling cancer for years and in recent months she took a sharp decline. I quickly came back to Canada to spend her last month with her. During that time, my girlfriend (who is genuinely the most loving and caring person I know) would ask me every day how she was. After a while, this became very difficult to know how to answer, as my mom was barely conscious and the only answer I could give was \"she's dying.\" I told my GF to stop asking me because it was difficult for me to answer, and I told her I would let her know if anything major happened. I appreciated her thinking of me, and I'll admit, I was a little blunt in how I said it (I was under stress but it's not an excuse, I know) and she understandably didn't take it well. We got past that though and everything was fine for the next few weeks.\n\nMy mother finally passed away last week, her funeral was a few days ago. I called my girlfriend for the first time in a while; we chatted, and eventually she asked me how my family was doing. Again, this was difficult for me to answer, because we're not fine and I just wanted to talk about other things. I gave her a very basic answer and probably sounded like I didn't want to be talking about it. She took this as me telling her off again, which I absolutely was not doing. I immediately clarified and said it was just difficult to answer, but as I previously mentioned, we have trouble letting things go, so she kept going. She insisted I was making her feel stupid. I asked her to please listen to me, told her it was just difficult to answer, and to just drop it and let's move on (considering the circumstances I really didn't want to fight), but she kept going. It then obviously escalated into a full fight. It ended when we had to go to sleep.\n\nThe next day she messaged me like nothing had happened, but I felt like she had  crossed a line, starting a pointless fight days after my mother's funeral, when I had begged her to just let it go. So I explained this to her; how it made me feel and asked if she could acknowledge that. The conversation kept going all day, heated at times, but she eventually apologized, and it ended with her telling me she would \"leave me alone.\" I didn't ask her to leave me alone, but she then proceeded to ignore my messages for 40 hours (I was no longer trying to discuss the situation, just trying to talk about her day and other regular stuff because she had already apologized, so to me it was over). But ignoring me made me feel awful again, especially considering what I'm already going through. When she finally did respond, she told me she was worried about our relationship and that she might cancel her plans to come out to Canada (I've paid for the flights already).\n\nI still want her to come, and I don't want our relationship to end over this. But I feel like I have to stick to my values here. To me, she's being unnecessarily heated and petty on an awful week for me. If she decides not to come, I feel like that might be the end of our relationship. I do try very hard to be self-critical, so if you all think I'm in the wrong here, need to just let this go or even apologize to her to prevent things from getting worse, then please tell me. Or else am I justified in feeling this way?",

If they decline for any reason, even if they say they\u2019re busy, then you must accept it as a lack of interest on their part. Obviously if they say they\u2019re busy but offer a date and time that works better for them then it can be considered an acceptance but if they say no or that they\u2019re busy (full stop), then you are not allowed to pursue it further.\n\nThere is a fairly attractive woman that worked in a department located near mine and we met in the break room a few weeks ago. She is cute however I have a strong policy of not dating coworkers. Full stop. (I have had horror stories happen to me and friends with office relationships and drama).\n\nShe sent me an email about a week and a half ago asking if I\u2019d like to grab drinks after work.

I cut her some slack and said \u201cnot really to be honest but I appreciate the invite!\u201d\n\nI thought that would be the end of the situation, but on Saturday morning at 2:45am I got a text message that said \u201care you sure you don\u2019t wanna grab drinks with me? \ud83d\ude09 \u201c\n\nI responded in the morning when I actually read it and I said that thanks but I\u2019m good Ann\u2019s have a great weekend.

Was it something I said? I\u2019m so sorry but like, I feel like I should know why it was?\u201d\n\nI ignored the text message and on this Monday first thing I did was walk straight into my bosses office.

Also I should reconsider maybe dating her and if not then I should at least be flattered and not pissed.\n\nThis caused me to wonder why my boss would have taken HER side and not her own employees (she is not the girls boss). So I looked at the members of one of the extracurricular social groups for Latin women, and I think they know each other through that group.\n\nShe\u2019s trying to protect her friend.

Currently, he has broken ribs, dislocated shoulder, he is on breathing support etc. He is in rough shape. As it came to be, it was not just any old car accident; he was drunk at 8:17 in the morning and lost control of his car and was gravely injured. Now, after hearing my mother and sister talk about this mishap, I chimed in with a little of my two-cents. I told them that I feel he should not be alive after his accident. Him still being alive is too good for what damage he has caused in his time, as well as what could still possibly happen. For years, he has been driving drunk due to his alcoholism and has little to no regard for others around him as long as he has a cold one in his hand.  He has put his hands on his family or basically been a dead beat dad for the entirety of his children's lives. My mom informed me without being so straight forward, that it is not my place to judge. I got a little heated saying his injuries were too good for someone who drives drunk frequently and hope he learns his lesson.\n\nNow,  I work in customer service for a phone company, and come across many men who cannot drive due to not having a license.

He was friendly, looked to be in good shape and seemed well fed.  I assumed he was just a neighbor's who was visiting.  We have a fixed calico who often invites boy kitties over.  It was very cold that night, around 18 F.  Cat freezing weather for sure.  So I told him I was fine with him spending the night.  I really thought he would go home when it got warmer.\n\nHe didn't.  We put a collar on him with our phone number and the words \"Call us.\"  No call.  We called animal control.  No one had called about him.  We took him to the vet to get scanned for a chip.  No luck.  And that's about it.  We don't use facebook, and we didn't put up flyers or make a newspaper help wanted ad.   We got him his shots and chipped a couple of weeks later.  He goes outside sometimes to sunbathe or chase squirrels, but mostly he just cuddles with us and claws up his toys.  The other cats get along with him pretty well.  He is part of our family now.\n\nHe obviously was never feral.  I doubt that he was outside for that long since he would have froze pretty quick.  My husband says he thinks he was dumped on our property, but we have no way to know that.  \n\nIt's clear that he doesn't think we're assholes for keeping him, but his original owners might if they didn't dump him.

A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it\u2019s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I\u2019ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I\u2019m not gonna say the name because it\u2019s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they\u2019re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we\u2019re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it\u2019s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it\u2019s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I\u2019m really not inclined to split the money.

We generally take precautions to keep them apart and safe. \n\nBut I messed up. My boyfriend usually deals with the bird. But he was away on a work trip so it fell to me. He texted me reminding me to clean the cage, which I really didn\u2019t wanna do without him there. But he was insistent that it was gonna be smelly and gross by the time he got back so I said okay. I put the cat in the carrier and went to take care of the bird. \n\nThe bird is usually pretty calm but today it freaked out and started flying. I wasn\u2019t too worried because there was nowhere for it to go. But I guess its movements must have triggered my cat because she went crazy and broke out of the carrier (which she has NEVER done before and I didn\u2019t even think it was possible). \n\nBefore I could do anything the cat climbed up the back of the couch and managed to snatch the bird. I started screaming and tried to get the bird away and ended up getting all scratched up and bloody in the process. It was too late anyway because the bird was dead.  I\u2019m grateful it didn\u2019t suffer too long but of course I\u2019m hysterical.

And because I fly so often I have status with Southwest and I am usually first 30 to get on the airplane. \n\nOn my flight to Kansas city this eventful day I walked into the plane as I usually do and looked for an emergency exit seat because I'm 6'4, have long legs and can't really fit in the regular seats. So I reach the emergency exit row and I see there's a backpack sitting in the aisle seat, and a man in the window seat and an open middle seat. Me not wanting to sit in the middle seat grab this unknown persons backpack and move it to the middle seat and basically take their aisle seat, all this knowing Southwest has an open seating policy where you can't claim seats. I know this person hasn't really sat in the seat because I was with A group and we all entered the plane at nearly the same time. \n\nAbout 2-3 minutes later a woman shows up coming from the direction of the bathroom on the plane, I'm assuming she had just put her backpack down to claim her seat and went to bathroom. She looks at me (I'm a young guy only 24) and doesn't even attempt to talk to me, just goes straight to the flight attendant saying I took her seat which I technically did. So the flight attendant comes and questions me about why I can't sit in all the other open seats. I'm a very confrontational type of person not someone who backs down easy, so I start arguing with the flight attendant that I am too tall to fit in a regular seat and don't want to sit in the middle seat. I tell her it's open seating and people can't claim seats and continue arguing with this flight attendent. At this point a scene has been caused and people are getting jammed up in the aisle, a second flight attendent who was listening in the line makes her way through and says \"Sir if you don't move out of that seat we will have to escort you off the plane\"\n\nAfter hearing this I momentarily thought about standing my ground and actually getting kicked off the plane but thought it wasn't worth it so I moved to the middle seat. As soon as I start moving the man in the window seat was so fed up and annoyed of me that he said you can have my seat and grabbed his stuff angrily and moved to a different row. I ended up sitting in his window seat and it made for a very awkward plane ride the rest of the flight. \n\nAm I in the wrong for taking someones seat, or do you think I'm justified in using the open seating policy and not allowing someone to claim a seat that they never sat in? \n\nTL:DR Southwest has open seating policy, you can't claim seats. I move someone's backpack and take their seat. Flight attendent threatens to kick me of the plane. ",

We recently bought our first home together after living in an apartment for the past 3 years. She\u2019s going to school for a PhD in biology and is doing great, and I just landed a job as a CPA while I finish my military contract. Everything is perfect... well, almost.\n\nWife has always had reptiles. She had them before I met her, and it is something she is extremely passionate about. She had about 5 snakes, 5 geckos, and a group of communal frogs. She takes great care of them and dedicates a good chunk of her time to them each day.\n\nI was never a huge fan of her creepy crawlies, but she never made me care for them and paid for them all herself so I didn\u2019t mind. I had absolutely nothing to do with them. \n\nThat brings us to our current issue... Wife is pregnant. It\u2019s not unwanted and we\u2019re both very excited, albeit nervous. \n\nI don\u2019t want to bring kids into a household with so many reptiles (possibility of bites, diseases such as salmonella, etc), she is adamant that her reptiles are staying. She said that our kids do not have to interact with or be around the reptiles if I didn\u2019t want them to, but she isn\u2019t getting rid of them because they\u2019re her \u201cpets\u201d and she\u2019s attached to them. We had quite a big argument about this. \n \nShe argued that her reptiles are kept in enclosures that the kids can\u2019t access, in a room that is easily locked, and she is very careful about hygiene and washing her hands after interacting with her reptiles. She also claimed none of her reptiles are dangerous or venomous, so they pose no threat.\n\nI simply don\u2019t feel comfortable with our kids growing up in a house full of reptiles.\n\nAfter our argument, I was angry and ended up putting all of her reptiles on Craigslist to be rehomed. She went away for a few days to take care of something for school and bada bing, bada boom... her reptiles were gone.\n\nShe came home, blew up at me, broke down crying, and asked how I could do this to her. She asked me if I rehomed her first snake, which she\u2019s had since she was 17 years old and raised from a baby. I told her all of them had been rehomed. \n\nShe acted like I killed her dog. She demanded I give her the info of the buyer, and I did, but it seems unlikely that she\u2019ll get any of them back.\n\nShe\u2019s threatening divorce over this. I am at a loss. They\u2019re *reptiles*. They\u2019re not cats or dogs, they don\u2019t bond with their owners. She\u2019s refusing to see my side of the situation and is treating me like some sort of monster.\n\nReddit, AITA? Should I have handled this differently?\n\n**EDIT/UPDATE**: Wow, I wasn\u2019t expecting this much of a response. I never viewed what I did as an asshole move because I guess I viewed her reptiles more like items/belongings that pose a threat to our children, rather than actual living things (which doesn\u2019t make it right, but that\u2019s thought process). I figured most people would agree that reptiles aren\u2019t safe to be in a house with children, and thought I could rally support on here so I could show my wife that I wasn\u2019t alone in my thinking. \n\nBut it\u2019s abundantly clear to me that I fucked up.\n\nI don\u2019t want my kids growing up in a household with reptiles. It was something I should\u2019ve talked to her about before she got pregnant.  I shouldn\u2019t have given her reptiles away behind her back, and yes, it does make me a monster. It was selfish and heartless of me to do, no matter my intentions. And I admit, I am nervous about becoming a dad. I wanted to wait until she finished school, and I\u2019m scared.\n\nI\u2019m likely going to be divorced within the next week or so. I seriously fucked up. I ruined my life and I don\u2019t know what to do. I contacted the buyer this morning and offered to buy all of the reptiles back for double the asking price, no response yet but I explained the situation and have my fingers crossed.\n\nI tried to talk to my wife and apologize but she wants nothing to do with me. She\u2019s inconsolable. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s really going to divorce me yet, but I don\u2019t doubt it.\n\nThanks for calling me out, Reddit. I was a fucking idiot.

I believed this until my mother popped in to ask if she put the right number of pills into my tea. I flew into a rage, poured my tea out and yelled at my friend for doing that to me. I also might have locked myself in the bathroom and starting punching myself to get the anger out (a bad habit of mine) but I managed to convince my family I was punching the wall. After that I continued yelling at my friend telling her I didn't appreciate being lied to. She tried to bite back saying I lied to my grandmother about doing my work soon when I actually have a problem finding motivation to do tasks no matter what they are. Then she left to go to bed and my grandmother said that I'd hurt my friend's feelings even though she didn't give a rats ass about my feelings when I was lied to and basically drugged by the person I care about the most.",

        "comment_body": "ESH \u2014 Your friend is definitely an asshole for drugging you. That\u2019s absolutely not cool. But you also seem like you have some serious emotional and psychological problems, poor/unhealthy coping mechanisms, and a tendency to not get help. It\u2019s less likely that your mom, grandmother, and friend are just randomly conspiring against you and more likely that you have some serious problems and they\u2019re just trying to help. You also seem to be (irrationally) afraid of medications that actually may help you.\n\nYou should consider ongoing therapy and working closely with a psychiatrist to find the best medications to support your rest and emotional health, while minimizing the side effects. It takes time, patience, and a willingness to give things a try with the knowledge they can always be changed slightly later. You should trust that you wouldn\u2019t be prescribed these things if a competent professional didn\u2019t think you could benefit from it. Get a second opinion if needed, but it\u2019s time to get help and not refuse the tools that will help you get better."

We have our ups and downs but hey who doesn\u2019t. \n\nRecently she invited me to go to a concert with her in a town that\u2019s 4 hrs away, I said of course I would go and everything was fine, we booked tickets, parking, etc. (our plan was to drive down and back home straight after the concert) flash forward 4 months to 2 weeks before the concert and she turns around and says I can\u2019t go anymore because she wants to go with her other girlfriends, so I\u2019m like that\u2019s cool, I\u2019ll just stay home. \n\nBut she asks me if I will drive her and her friends down to this concert 4 hrs away, then sit in the car and wait in the car park for her for another 4 hrs and then drive 4 hrs home. I say no and she looses her mind, saying that I\u2019m a horrible boyfriend and why won\u2019t I take her down to this concert and sit in the car, in a car park and wait for 4 hrs with nothing to do. \n\nShe goes on being cranky at me for a week about it until eventually I give in and say I\u2019ll drive her and wait, but her and her friends have to chip in for fuel. But then she gets cranky all over again saying no. I \u201coffered\u201d to take her so I should pay the fuel. \n\nSo now I\u2019m sitting in a car park, it\u2019s 8pm.

It has just been too much for me. I'm happy to see them occasionally and do my duty so to speak, but it's just been too frequent for me. In no universe do I want to prevent her from seeing them, but I feel that I need to be opting out more often than not recently. She has gotten frustrated with me whenever I opt out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer family are genuinely great people, but it is exhausting being with them. We connect politely, but I don't really have much in common with her parents or her sister. When we're over there she is enjoying her time, chatting, doing whatever -- but I'm always left twiddling  my thumbs (and I try to make small talk, connect, etc.). I swear I have tried, but the experience is 9 times out 10 just immensely boring - and I feel that I need to be sort of \"on my best behavior\" - which is exhausting. What can be frustrating too is that she'll go off with her sister and literally ignore me when I try to continue a conversation with them -- or just hang out. I get that seeing her family is a part of the deal, but spending time with them is killing me and I don't get why I have to be there along with her so frequently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCase in point: we went to her family's for Thanksgiving. We were there for the day, awesome, cool, normal Thanksgiving. Then, it's like 7 pm - about time to leave right? Great to see you, hugs, bye - then, she decides to sleep over. She poses this as a question to me - but it's not really a question, it's an answer yes or I'll get teary eyed, pouty, and become a mute for the rest of the day. So 7 pm to 11 pm is spent watching fucking America's Funniest Home videos with her family, who I've already spent \\~10-15 hours with that week -- and literally just kill me. The next morning we are then still there until like 1 pm - she's talking to her parents about different things, while I am twiddling my thumbs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, this sort of a came to a head today. She's going over her parents to make perogies for Christmas. I offered to come for 4-5 hours to help out. She was less than content with this idea. She told me she doesn't know when she wants to leave (read: we will be leaving at 10 pm and the entire Saturday will be spent with me attempting to make small talk and twiddling my thumbs). I offered to drive my own car and leave after the 4-5 hours. Same answer.

        "post_body": "Throwaway because people know my main account. \n\nHello all, this is a situation that happened about a year ago but every time I think about it I get upset and I really want to know, AITA? \n\nI\u2019ll try to keep this as short as possible, but this requires some backstory. I\u2019m a student at a university and I was looking for a place to live for a year when one of my friends said she needed another person in her group, so not having any options lined up I jumped on the opportunity. I didn\u2019t know any of the other girls but we met and they seemed nice so I agreed to move in with them. Something happened with my friend and she had to back out of the deal, leaving me with these four other girls that I didn\u2019t really know. However, we had already been looking at houses together so I figured we might as well go through with it, this ended up being a terrible mistake. It should also be noted that I was the only one who had not lived in a dorm so I had a lot more furniture than everyone else which was put in the common areas. \n\nWhile I am aware that I am not a perfect roommate (who is?), some things happened throughout the first semester of us living together that made it very hard for me to be at home. To start off with, I have a very busy major which requires me to work in a studio most of the time so I tend not to be home very often, especially as the semester kicks into gear. I already felt kind of weird because the other girls knew each other and with me not being around a lot I felt a little isolated. \n\nAt first everything was okay, but then things started to get out of control. One of the girls was apparently fed up with being the only person cleaning (which no one asked her to do - she was very anal about her level of cleanliness and was scrubbing floors and all kinds of surfaces) and she made a chore chart for everyone and had a meeting (at a time I was in studio) with all the roommates about it except me. I was not aware of the chore chart so I didn\u2019t do my chores for the week, and when I came home one day I was confronted about it. I am not a very confrontational person and I got upset because I literally had no idea what my roommates were talking about (which apparently didn\u2019t matter). I grew up in a family of 6, so I\u2019m pretty clean but I\u2019m used to living in a mess. I do try to keep the common areas clean and do things like my dishes, but I\u2019m not as worried about something like scrubbing down the bathroom every week. Which I don\u2019t mind helping out with chores, but again I had no idea that a chore chart was even a thing. \n\nSituations like that happened more often, which I think is mostly due to the fact that I wasn\u2019t there which resulted in me getting blamed for things as I wasn\u2019t there to defend myself. I would get yelled at for leaving dishes in the sink (most of the time that weren\u2019t mine) for a day, and for other small things. One time I left the door unlocked one night when I got home late (around 3 AM) from working on a project and I went straight to bed and simply forgot. The next day I was confronted by all of my roommates sitting on the couch when I got home saying that I needed to apologize to them for leaving the door unlocked and how I didn\u2019t care about anyone else except myself. Now, to be fair, around this time there were stories of someone breaking into houses (not where we lived but still) so people were a little on edge. However, they are saying how selfish I am while sitting on my couch, watching my TV, using my Fire stick. \n\nThe thing that really made me mad though was whenever I brought over my boyfriend. My boyfriend didn\u2019t live in the same town (he went to a different university) so whenever he would come over he would usually stay for the weekend. We had agreed at the beginning of the year it was fine to have guys over as long as you told people. However, I would come home multiple times to my roommates having their boyfriends over, which wasn\u2019t a big deal, but they would always chew me out if I forgot to give them a few days notice of my boyfriend coming up. \n\nAt the end of the semester, I brought my boyfriend over to stay for the week of finals because he was done with school and I wanted to hang out. I forgot to tell my roommates he was coming because I was spending a lot of time working on a project and it slipped my mind. When I was heading out the night he came over my roommates ambushed me and told me that my boyfriend couldn\u2019t stay over for the week and were telling me how disrespectful I was and all this stuff. I started crying and left to hang out with my friends. I got pretty drunk and my sober friend told me that we should just take all of my stuff in the common spaces into my room if my roommates thought I was so selfish. So, me being drunk, I agreed expecting my roommates to be asleep and that I could just move my stuff quietly. When we got to my house however, my roommates were watching my TV and I didn\u2019t want to chicken out (liquid courage I suppose) and I began moving all my stuff upstairs without saying a word. My roommates realized what was happening and started screaming at me and calling me all sorts of names saying how my parents must be so proud of me and all this shit. They kept saying how loud I was being and the only thing I said that night was, \u201cYou guys are the ones screaming at me right now.\u201d \n\nLong story short, I moved all my stuff into my room (couldn\u2019t fit the couch, so I just took the cushions) and my roommates wanted me to leave. I agreed but they wouldn\u2019t agree to a sub leaser (All my roommates had to agree per the lease) so I had to stay for the next semester. After I cooled down I offered to move my stuff back downstairs but they declined. So, Reddit, AITA?\n\nTLDR: I moved into a 5 person house with 4 girls I didn\u2019t know who confronted me about petty things constantly even though I wasn\u2019t the only one who wasn\u2019t doing all my chores or having my boyfriend over without telling people. One night when the confrontations came to a head and I was called selfish, I moved all of my stuff out of the common rooms (which was pretty much everything except for kitchen stuff) and into my bedroom. \n\nEdit: Fixed acronym",

In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner was such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and wet, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it.

So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still).

To save an argument I eventually relented and apologised, although they at no point actually mentioned whether it not they'd checked if he had it.\n\nThe time of year peer pressured me into what I feel was an unjustified apology, but it was something I did to avoid Christmas drama nonetheless. It's also noteworthy that it wasn't originally my assumption, it was my dad who first thought of it but he wasn't comfortable asking them, so I was the one to make the call.\n\nSo Reddit, if I'm missing anything out you'd like to know please feel free to ask, but AITA in this situation?\n\n\nEDIT: fixed phone autocorrect mistakes",

My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.\n\nNose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.\n\nThis really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do.

        "post_body": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my 19 year old nephew is back from his sophomore year of college. He\u2019s a great guy and I could sing praises about his character all day. He\u2019s everything I would wish for if I had a kid of my own. We\u2019ve generally been close as uncle-nephew. We text each other once a week or so, we play games together, I speak to him in Korean because he wants to learn our family\u2019s native language better (we all live in America), and he has always seen me as an older brother. \n\nIn August, he called me to ask me for advice about women, which is not a topic that has not come up very often but it\u2019s something I\u2019m comfortable discussing with him. He told me that he\u2019s having no luck with girls in college, no hookups, a couple of unsuccessful dates, and that he\u2019s a virgin. None of this seemed strange to me, some people are just late bloomers and I don\u2019t see a problem with that. But he confessed to me that these things really weigh on him, and that he knows even though he shouldn\u2019t measure himself by his success in fucking, he can\u2019t help but feel like society pressures him to be that way. Then he dropped the real reason for the call, he was wondering if I could help him get a prostitute so he knows what sex is like and won\u2019t be so nervous for when he does find a girl who genuinely likes him. Now for a little bit of cultural context, purchasing sex in South Korea is more common than you\u2019d think, but rarely is it ever spoken about publicly. And my nephew knows that people I know in the Korean American community would be able to find him a girl here in America who would be willing to undergo STD testing before meeting up with him (so long as we pay for it). \n\nI told him that while I\u2019m not against seeing a hooker, I know that his parents would kill me if I helped him and that going to see a hooker is something that\u2019s going to follow him for the rest of his life. Either he has to lie about it when he does find an appropriate long term partner, or he\u2019ll have to hope she accepts that about him. Sometime around the beginning of November, he tells me that he has decided to go through with the hooker if I could find him one. He even tells me he could pay the full cost with the money he has earned through his part time job\n\nSo I contact my friend and we found him a sex worker who lives about an hour away from his house. The girl is also a Korean American and she\u2019s going to college just as my nephew is, she just needs some extra money on the side. My nephew sent me money through Venmo to pay for her to get tested at Planned Parenthood, and after the results came back we make plans for him and her to meet up yesterday. I got him a hotel room near her house with a whole box of Trojans and some lube, and my nephew went and saw her. After the two hours, he came out and thanked me, he said it was super awkward and strange for him to be naked in front of a girl, but that he didn\u2019t regret it. He admitted that he was totally spent after 40 minutes and just spent the rest of the time cuddling and talking to her about each other\u2019s lives (which he said was almost as awesome as the sex itself). \n\nThen my nephew, ever the considerate guy, asked me how I was feeling knowing that this was strange for me too. I told him I was fine, but I asked him if he was ever going to tell this to his parents, or anyone for that matter. He told me that there is no chance he would ever tell his parents about this, he\u2019s fairly close to his parents and they\u2019re not very conservative, but they are church going Christians nonetheless. \n\nA part of me feels like an asshole, but my nephew is a legal adult and the girl we hired was not some trafficked woman.",

L was being a typical 3 year old - getting into stuff, whining, tantrums, etc. Sis in law told me that it was because she wasn\u2019t getting the  attention from me that she usually gets. She asked if I\u2019d take L on a day date, just the 2 of us because she was feeling jealous. I said no because I was recovering from a really traumatic labor and taking care of a newborn baby. Sis in law got mad, Christmas dinner fight, the whole shebang. Anyway, that was 4 years ago and it\u2019s the same thing, constantly. L is feeling jealous of my daughter, B. Sis in law doesn\u2019t think that L gets enough attention. \n\nBecause Bs birthday is so close to Christmas and we always had something going on, we never had a big birthday party for her. Just cake and a few balloons on her birthday. L has always had huge Pinterest inspired parties and I\u2019ve only missed one of them because my mom had to be admitted to the hospital the day of and I was the one who took her. Anyway, this year B turned 4 and wanted a party with all of her friends. I scheduled it for beginning of December so all of her friends could come and it didn\u2019t interfere with holiday stuff. Everything went great, B had a great time. Sis in law has decided against a birthday party this year for L because they\u2019re taking her out of town next month for a big celebration. \n\nYesterday was my daughters actual birthday and even though we already celebrated with a birthday party, I still wanted to make it special for her. We had a full day planned: breakfast at her favorite spot, movie, manicure then home to get ready for a Christmas party with some close friends at our house. Sis in law calls me. She\u2019s decided that L does need a birthday party and it\u2019s going to be that night (last night). I told her that we couldn\u2019t make it because (1) we had plans and (2) it\u2019s my daughters birthday, not hers and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that my daughter has to share her special day.\n\nSis in law called me multiple times during our Christmas party, niece called multiple times and left messages, asking why we weren\u2019t there.

I live in an apartment complex that comprises of several buildings scattered across what used to be open farm land. I live on the second floor of a building thats at the very end of said farmland. So you need to drive a bit to get to my building and climb a large noisy set of stairs to get to my apartment. Furthermore, I have blackout curtains. They don't filter out everything but you have to be seriously scoping out my apartment to know if the lights are on.\n\nI also used to work door to door sales for several companies. The first rule of door to door sales, is to identify yourself the moment you get a response at the door. Not doing so increases your risk of having the cops called, or worse, being shot. Not even exaggerating, it's happened. \n\nThis happened awhile ago and I'm wondering if I was the asshole for how I reacted. It's 6pm on a Sunday night, and I'm half way through a bottle of wine chilling in my living area when I hear a loud engine pull up to my building below. Someone gets out of the car and absolutely charges up my staircase to my apartment door. At first I think it's my neighbor next door. We get along well and sometimes when she's coming home from a party she uses my stair case instead of hers (our porches connect).\n\nBut this isn't her. She runs up my staircase which my neighbor has never done, and starts banging on my door like she's trying to break it down.\n\n\"Hello!?\" -- it's a womans voice\n\n\"Hello? Who is it?\"\n\n\"Hello, can you open the door?\"\n\n\"what do you want? And who are you\"\n\nno answer. but also no footsteps back downstairs so I know this person is still at my door. after a few seconds she starts banging at my door again. \n\n\"Ma'am you need to identify yourself!\" -- still no answer. Alarm bells are going off in my head. Again, I've worked direct sales. This person is refusing to give at least a name, then they're not police and they're not a salesperson for any company. I'm also at that level of drunkenness where you're nice and warm and very aware of your limitations. If this person forces their way in I won't be able to hold my own in a fight. \n\n\"Lady you need to tell me who you are or I'm calling the police. This is not okay.\"\n\nThreatening to call the police must've scared her because she starts charging back down my stairwell at this point. once i can't hear the footsteps anymore I grab the small knife from my cutting block and run downstairs. I get to the bottom just as the woman is getting in her car. I call out to her but she doesn't respond. finally right as her car is in front of my stair well again she gets out of the car and addresses me. \n\nShe's looking for building 5. \n\ndafaq really? Building 5 is two buildings up the drive way and it's where the laundromat is so it's well lit. I point here in the right direction and head back upstairs hiding my right hand from her. I'm still not completely calmed down right now, and I'll be definitely sleeping with the boot knife I keep on my night stand. I guess I just need to know if I over reacted here. \n\nEdit: now that it's morning and I've slept off the alcohol i agree with everyone saying I was a moron for confronting her. I make no excuses for that, and honestly it kinda scares me how fast i went from \"I can't defend myself right now\" to \"fuck it just grab a a knife and go out there\".

She argued back that she could arrange with him that he's not allowed to come around when she is babysitting, but given his past behavior I told her that I can't trust that. She basically made me feel like I'm taking her granddaughter away from her because I don't like her boyfriend. I resent her for putting me in this position. \n\nI could go into lengthy detail about their relationship history to illustrate how wretched he is but I'll spare you that, at least for now. ",

        "post_body": "Let me know if this isn\u2019t the exactly right place, but I figured the discourse fit and I\u2019d like another point of view. \n\nSo my gf a year and a half has become friends with a lot of her coworkers which is a great thing. However, I found it strange just how much she talks to one coworker specifically. This coworker texts her nonstop from the time she wakes up until she goes to sleep, even when we are spending time together. Anything short of the two of us getting intimate has her with her phone in her hands. I could be trying to cuddle with her or share an emotional moment and her phone is in hand texting this guy. I know there\u2019s nothing sexual going on because my gf doesn\u2019t turn her phone screen away when we are together so she has nothing to hide.\n\nHowever, this allows me to easily look over and see what he\u2019s saying and I gotta say it makes me uncomfortable. One time he was talking about how he doesn\u2019t understand fetishes, which looked to me like he was listing a bunch of fetishes and waiting to for my gf to say, \u201chey that one\u2019s not that bad\u201d so he can see what she\u2019s into. Another thing I\u2019ve seen him say is, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t hold it against me would you? Not that I wouldn\u2019t want you to\ud83d\ude08\u201d (context unknown). My gf always segues away from these attempts but never outright tells him it\u2019s inappropriate, despite my saying that he\u2019s flirting with her. She just denies it and says they\u2019re not like that. \n\nOne day more recently, she went out to dinner with her apartment mates that she lives with without inviting me (I have no problem with this as I understand the need for a girl\u2019s night). I asked who all went along and she listed them off including this male coworker who is definitely not one of the apartment mates. At this point it became incredibly obvious that I had not been invited for some reason. I said have fun and told her I was going to bed. \n\nThe next day we had a conversation and I said I thought the way she treated this other guy in favor of me was inappropriate in my opinion and it made me feel insignificant when I would do anything for her. I said it made me feel bad that I didn\u2019t get to enjoy time with her but this other guy who likes her too gets to be happy spending time with her. She told me I was being manipulative and making her feel bad for being with her friends. I believed this for a long time until recently when I noticed that I didn\u2019t do anything manipulative. In my opinion I was just saying how I felt. In my opinion if you feel guilty for making someone else feel bad they aren\u2019t being manipulative, maybe you acted in a way that you should feel guilty for? \n\nAm I the asshole here? I\u2019ve tried to recreate this as best I can from my point of view. \n\nEdit: I want to thank everyone for giving their honest opinions. I formatted this in a way that made us appear to still be together to try to avoid a bias. However, she broke up with me on the day we talked after going out with friends. I blamed myself, because she did, for a very long time until recently when I started feeling like I didn\u2019t do anything wrong and her actions were not how you treat someone you really love.

        "post_body": "This one is a little interesting\n\nA little backstory first.\n\nI am a manager (m 19) at a movie theater, in a rougher part of a major Canadian city.\n\nWhile cleaning a theater to prepare it for the next showing, a 16 year old looking kid came into the theater trying to find his hat. No problem, stuff gets lost all the time, and I know exactly where to look; (stuff almost always finds its way under the seats). The whole time we were looking, he was cussing under his breath, \"son of a bitch\" \"fuck me,\" to me it seemed a little excessive but i understand people get frustrated when they lose things. I would expect this reaction if someone had lost their phone, but he had only lost his hat. Anyways I find his hat (under the seat), he takes it, says thanks, and goes on his way. The hat was a black hat with a Dos Equis logo on it. After he leaves, I think to myself \"wow that interaction was weird,\" and go on with my day without thinking anything of it. \n\nfast forward about an hour\n\ni was at box office when a guest informed me there was a disturbance by the vending machines. I thank her for informing me and start heading over there. Immediately I see a man throwing punches at another individual. I intervene and tell the man to leave now. He turns around (he appears to be a teenager) and very smugly chuckles and says \"oh thats my mom.\" I say \"doesnt matter, you need to leave now.\" To me it seemed like he thought he could get away with doing whatever he wanted to his mom, judging on his response. regardless, I was going to kick him out no matter what his response was. He requested to leave out of the front doors, which I thought was an odd request considering what had just happened. I said no and escorted him out of the side doors. He kicks the door on the way out.\n\nI go to check up on the mom, she is okay but has tears in her eyes. Behind her is her younger son who was holding onto his eye and crying (he had gotten a black eye from his older brother). I ask if she is okay, she says yes, she says that her son is autistic and is 16 but has the mental capacity of an 8 year old. That explains it. She was completely silent from when i approached the situation, until I asked if she was okay, she had not said anything while I was kicking the kid out. Regardless, we give her a refund, a few passes and send her on her way (this took about 10 minutes from the time i asked her if she was okay). I apologized for kicking him out, saying that when I saw violence i had to act. She says not to worry.\n\nAfter a few minutes I realized the kid was the same kid who lost his hat (i had recognized the hat). this explained his behavior to me. \n\nFast forward about an hour, I was coming back from break.\n\nAs I walk in the doors, a fellow manager says to me that the cops are here, looking for someone. (he shows me a picture of the individual). its the kid. fuck. \n\nI go up to the cops, they asked for my story, I told them i saw someone throwing punches and kicked him out. They said he was autistic. I told them the mom told me until thereafter. They said not to worry, but that he had gone missing. \n\nTurns out that when i kicked him out he kinda just kept walking instead of waiting for his mom or whatever, and again, this is in a rough neighborhood. \n\nSo am I an asshole for kicking out an autistic kid, leading to him going missing? I feel like perhaps I should have waited and asked the mom before kicking him out, but she never said anything while i was doing it. I have no idea what happened to this kid, and I feel really bad that my actions led him to going missing. Then again, I also feel justified in this situation because the dude was beating the shit out of his family, what else could I have done. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone needs any extra details or clarification just let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.",

My daughter only told me about this yesterday so of course I\u2019m a little annoyed already because this mean I am actually the one buying the stuff (paying); which as I\u2019m sure most of the rest of you, I\u2019m hit up this time of year for $20 every time I step into a room. \n\nAnyhow, we come up with two different gifts for these two parties and one gift was right at $20 and the other was $17-$18.

A $5 blanket (literally tag was on) and a pair of fuzzy socks from the dollar store. In other words- $6. \n\nSo l am annoyed.

While I see where my SO is coming from, I still agree with my family. My SO is on the side that we should let the past go and move on with what we have now. My SO has a different point of view because there have been divorces in that family but nothing that involved cheating like this. \n\nI guess my question is; am I an asshole if myself and my family continue to not respect my uncle's decision?

        "post_body": "Growing up with my parents, I never had any privacy. My mom would say that me wanting privacy was just me being up to no good. She would frequently kick open my door when she knew I would be getting dressed for something, and she would stand there stare at me, and call me fat, ugly, repulsive, etc. And I wasn't allowed to get her out of my room, I just had to get dressed as quick as I could at that point. This went on from puberty until I moved out of the house this past August for college, a university 3 hours away that I got a full ride to attend.\n\nLast week I came back home from my first semester in college. As you can probably already tell, my relationship with my parents is very damaged and could very well be categorized as abusive, most of this stemming from the cultural difference as they were born and raised in a Muslim country while I was born and raised in the US (this applies). I already did not want to spend the break at my parent's house but was pretty much obligated to.\n\nI left all of my bags in my room and went out with a friend I hadn't seen in a while. I was only gone for about an hour and when I came back, my dad sits with me in my room and says my mom went through my bag and found my pipe. I smoke weed occasionally, about once a week, even less sometimes. I told him that it's not a big deal, I finished this semester with good grades, and that everyone gets out of line in college- most of my friends get shitfaced every weekend while I choose to smoke a little with friends and hang out on the weekends. This did not process well with my dad. \n\nHe started to tell me that him and my mom were going to check me into rehab to try and \"reverse the addiction\" that I have with marijuana. As he was saying this, I looked around my room and realized that every single one of my bags had everything taken out and thrown back in. This sight infuriated me, so I zipped up my bags and I left. \n\nIt's not about the pipe or anything. It's about the fact that I feel completely violated as a guest. I am a financially independent adult living in a new city, on the road to a science degree, but my bags still get searched by my parents. One person I brought this up with said my parents should have the right to know whats in their house, but in that case, they should be able to search through all of their friend's belongings too when they come over. But my mom started texting me that I was a shameful daughter and a disgusting person for leaving, and that she has every right, as my parent, to go through my things no matter how old I am because \"that's what other parents advise online.\" \n\nSo, AITA for leaving my parent's house for winter break after they looked through all of my shit?",

        "post_body": "Not sure if this is the right sub but I needed to tell my story and get an unbiased opinion. Using a throwaway account as I am not interested in Karma and the details are very private so I wish to remain anonymous. Warning this is long, as I am a very detailed person. This is just one issue in a very hard year, as there is much more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo start off I guess, my son is dead. My little boy was 13 months old. A pillar of health. We cherished and looked after that boy with all we had. His perfect on Tuesday and Dying on Wednesday, and passed 7 days later. This is a whole other story unto itself.  I got along well enough with my in-laws. my mother-in-law acts very immature and erratic. My wife told her mom used to an alcoholic. As I got more confident in my relationship with my wife I told her \"I think your mom might have alcoholic brain damage\"\n\nWhere I need help is this...\n\nMy son needed emergency surgery as his brain, for unexplained reasons, was swelling. They had to remove part of his skull to allow for the expansion. My parents arrived within an hour of my call. My in-laws (whom this post is about) arrived much later even though they live 30 mins closer.\n\nMy in-laws left as quickly as they arrived. My parents however stayed.  They slept on waiting room coffee tables waiting to hear if our little boy would live. He made it through that first surgery, only to pass away the day after mother's day.\n\nMy parents never left our side. Even though they had brought no clothes or supplies. My in laws on the other hand did not reappear until it was time to say goodbye. My mother-in-law arrived in Pajama shorts and a t shirt that was too small to hid her girth. She began to ask the nurse if they ever treated any murders.\n\nAs we took our time saying our goodbyes, she noisily played games on her iPad.\n\nThe nurses arranged it so we could take him outside one last time even though he was on life support. You see our son rarely cried but whenever he did we simply took him outside. It cheered him up instantly. Being outdoors was his favorite place in the world.\n\nMy wife went first, and held him one last time beneath the stars to say goodbye before I even had my turn my mother in law asked us to hurry up. I was furious. I told her in he calmest voice I could muster \"leave\". I meant for her to go home. She took it as permission to go inside. She stopped to clarify and I just said \"Go!\"\n\nWe brought my son back inside and they disconnected him from the machines that kept him alive. It was the hardest thing ever. (I have been diagnosed with depression, severe anxiety and PTSD and I am on anti-depressants as a result.)\n\nWhile we were waiting for him to pass on he slowly was turning grey my mother in law decided to clean up his hospital room. Problem with that is as you know she wasn't there, so the stuff she was throwing out was our paperwork from the social worker for grief support etc.  My mom stopped her from throwing it out. While I yelled at her to stop. All the while my father-in-law and sister-in-law sat there doing nothing with annoyed looks.\n\nWhen he was finally gone, my wife had to wait for the nurses to remove him from her arms, which is quite difficult as he was limp. My mother-in-law left immediately. When my wife got up she asked crying \"where is my mom? I need a hug\".\n\nWe did not see or speak to my in laws for 2 days. We couldn't bear the hurt on top of the grief. I decided to clear the air and invited just my father-in law for lunch. He arrived and made idle chit chat and then got up to leave. I said what about lunch? He said he needed to get home. We told him to wait; we needed to discussed somethings.\n\nWe described how hurt we were by my mother in laws behavior and he said she just didn't cope well. We said we would do our best to understand, but while we are sorting out our feelings please ask her not to disturb us, and also if she is struggling that she has the option not to come to our son's visitation, we would understand. His response was \"well I guess I'll go home and kill myself\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no clue what he said to my mother-in-law. Next thing we know she phones and says \"I hear you are upset with me. TOO. FUCKING.BAD. I won't be at the visitation.\" 'Click'\n\nI was furious. I feel like I had just failed as a father, I was not going to fail as a husband. I immediately called her back and tore her a new one. Her response was \"I am not going to talk to you if you are going to use that language\".\n\nI said \"Fuck you! you don't get to swear at my grieving wife and then claim some kind of moral high ground!\" She hung up on me. She immediately phone my wife who has said and done nothing at this point. She calls my wife a fucking bitch and hangs up. She begins to phone us every 2 seconds. The she starts sending threatening texts that she will harm us.\n\nI call my father-in-law and told him to get things under control or I am calling the police. He begged me not to call the cops and took away her phone.\n\nThe calls stopped.\n\nWe did not receive any support from my wife's family. They did not attend any events prior to his Visitation. My father in-law showed up late to my sons visitation in cargo shirt and an old golf shirt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days pass. I call my wife's aunt who I have gotten to know a little as they are not a close family.\n\nI asked her for some perspective on the my mother-in law. She said they had a falling out over 20 years ago. The aunt had apparently cancelled a sleep over between my wife and her cousin. The cousin didn't want to go anymore.\n\nMy mother-in-law told the aunt \"I hope you die\". She then drove over to their home knocked on the aunt's door and told her again face to face \"I hope you die\". Apparently My wife's family disappeared for 3 years. the extended family had no idea where they were.\n\nThen we spoke to my Wife's grandmother. She told us that my mother in law was diagnosed as bi-polar years ago and has a history of violent behavior, including smashing the grandmother in a car door, repeatedly.\n\nThe grandmother says re-iterates that they lost track of my wife and in-laws whereabouts for 3 years. She feared that she would be violent towards my wife. My wife broke into tears saying that her mother had beaten her repeatedly in her drunken stupors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we have a clearer picture. my Mother in-law is mentally ill.\n\nMy father-in-law knew this and hid it from his children. He knew how unstable his wife was and still brought her to the hospital. He completely mismanaged the situation by keeping everyone in the dark. My wife asked him very respectfully for a break in communication(advice from her therapist) as she needed to heal and her family was hurting more than helping.\n\nIts been a few months and we finally heard from him again. I have copy and pasted his email below\n\n \"I hope you are doing well, you are always in my thoughts. I'm   \nwriting this email because we really need your help with mom.  \nShe has been in the psych. ward in the  hospitable twice, once   \nfor 6 days and then for over 2 weeks.  \nThe root of this problem was her reaction to your son's passing and how her   \nreaction to this was treated. As her therapist says, everybody reacts to   \ndeath differently and no two people grieve the same. I think it would be   \nhealthier if you two could\u00a0 get past this and start a healing process.  \nAt the present your mother is sliding back into her very depressed   \nstate, brought on by two things: the absence of your son and the absence of   \nher eldest daughter. She said this to her therapist at her latest session.  \nI'm sure mum miss's you and thinks of you often but is nervous to reach   \nout to you as you may not be ready for this.  \nMoms therapist is very concerned with your moms mental state so........I   \nthink a phone call or set up a visit ( just you ) to see if you two can   \nreconnect at some level, even if it's meeting at a coffee shop or at   \nmom's therapist's office. Whatever you are both comfortable with.  \nIt may or may not work but I see this as a good viable option to whats   \ngoing on now.  \nSo, mull this over and please let me know if us getting together is a   \npossibility. We would really like it to be.  \nLove Dad. \"\n\nIn her response my wife told him everything we had learned and pointed out how he had failed as a father, including this email which was void of fatherly concern for her well being. She did offer to meet with mother in laws therapist, if it would help.\n\nHis response was \"Sorry to have disappointed you. Have a nice life!\"\n\nI was furious with this email. Not only did he not care about my wife's mental state, he did not try to reestablish communications first before making an ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife has made the decision she is done with her parents. I have supported her decision as they have been toxic to both our recovery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: removed some personal identifying details form FIL email.\n\nThank you for my first Silver even though it's a throwaway.",

        "post_body": "This couple I\u2019m not very close with but the wife is a long-time family friend so I felt that I should invite her. To be clear, all of my invitations stated that there were to be no children at this wedding. But she and her husband showed up with their infant and toddler (who I think is like 3-4). \n\nAt the actual wedding ceremony, I let it slide. I was preoccupied for obvious reasons. I also thought that maybe they planned not to attend the reception or to have someone pick the kids up before it started. (My niece, who was our flower girl, and a few other kids who had to be at the wedding for one reason or another we\u2019re getting picked up/dropped off after the ceremony ended). \n\nAnyway the reception rolls around (I\u2019m fast forwarding through irrelevant details about the wedding but it was beautiful and everything went as smoothly as could be expected). The couple comes and, lo and behold, they still have their children.\n\nI had many other guests and didn\u2019t really feel like dealing with it so I asked our event planner to go over to them and discuss whether someone was picking up the child as the reception (and wedding, frankly!) were not supposed to have children. \n\nI mean, everyone was drinking and loud and rowdy and  a crying child and another little one running around was not part of the plan. (The infant  already had to be taken out once during the wedding ceremony because of fussiness and the toddler was, from what I could see, already appearing cranky). \n\nMy event planner went to talk to the couple. I could tell they were arguing with my event planner though so I went over to help him. I think they thought I came to rescue them because they started going on about how rude my event planner was. I explained that I had actually sent him over to discuss the children. I reiterated that the event was child-free and said that I had stated so clearly on my invitations. \n\nThe wife gave a sort of apology and then assured me that they were capable of minding their own children to make sure they didn\u2019t get in the way of anything. I said that wasn\u2019t really the point. That\u2019s when my now-husband comes over and he and the other woman\u2019s husband begin going back and forth and things got a little heated. \n\nFinally I snapped and said that they just needed to go, which, thankfully they did without much more noise. Still, the whole scene was incredibly embarrassing which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. \n\nI really hate that my wedding day had to be somewhat marred by this incident. According to my mother, everyone was talking about it and I guess enjoying a little dramatic entertainment. \n\nWas I the a-hole for making them leave?\n\n**Edit 1: Wow um this kind of blew up out of nowhere. Thank you all so much for the feedback. What I\u2019ve gotten from this is that most people think that the couple was rude. There are also a select few who feel that it\u2019s assholish to have a kid-free wedding at all which is...interesting.**\n\n**By way of an update, I have now learned that a few family members felt that it was inappropriate of me to kick out the couple. (The wife apparently is still angry about getting kicked out and the husband is FALSELY telling people that we threatened to call the cops on them). No one has said anything directly to me though.**\n\n**Anyway the feedback here has helped me not to feel guilty about that and just realize that not everyone has the same ideas about tact and manners.** \n\n**Edit 2: Well apparently this went somewhat viral and has now been in articles on Fox News, DailyMail, and Yahoo News. Many thanks to those in the comments who let me know! I had used a throwaway account to stay anonymous and lowkey, but I guess that\u2019s out the window lol.

That was fine because I knew what I was getting into with her. \n\nBut what irks me is that it\u2019s like she regresses when she gets around her parents. I don\u2019t know how to even articulate it.

        "post_body": "I'll try and keep this short.  Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\n**EDIT** We did mention early on that she could use a calculator, but she declined saying she could do it herself.  No idea why she declined that option tbh.\n\n**EDIT 2** Adam spoke with Sarah at work today and she apologized for the outburst and wanted to come back and play with us.  We added her to a group chat and apologized for not communicating better the issues we were having with her.  She agrees she was stubborn and will just use a calculator going forward.  We agree we could have been clearer on the impact the slowness was having on our enjoyment of the game.  We also made it clear we don't judge her for being bad at math.  We just want her to use the tools she needs to help her keep up the pace we need to enjoy the game.\n\nI can accept that I was a bit of an asshole in this exchange.  I don't think I was wrong to want her gone if things wouldn't improve, but I was wrong in the way I handled the events leading up to the outburst.",

You put unnecessary pressure on her to improve her mental math in a week, a skill that takes months/years of practice to noticeably improve, which was the worst way of going about it.

        "post_body": " I personally don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole, but my other friends do.\u00a0\n\nSo, I\u2019m a college student and I used to be friends with this person, let\u2019s call her Amy. Amy and I met through mutual friends and we hung out together pretty often. We also had a class together, and we both took a foreign language class. The thing that annoyed me, though, is she would ask me for help with things, and then criticize me and basically say I\u2019m wrong, then complain about not doing well and blame me and the world for not helping her or for being unfair. We also had a group chat with all of our friends, but it was mostly Amy spamming it and complaining about not doing well in classes, not wanting to study, how her sister got a kitten but she only got a bunny, etc. Annoying, but whatever.\u00a0\n\nThen one of our classes had a paper due, and Amy asked if I could help her. I invited her own to my dorm room, and she brought her ESA animal with my permission. At this point I was already contemplating how to explain I didn\u2019t want to be friends with her anymore, but I wanted to try to help her one last time. That\u2019s when things got really downhill. I regret this decision.\u00a0\n\nShe invaded my privacy by opening my drawers and making fun of what I had. She made a mess in my room and didn\u2019t clean it up. She would ask for my help then criticize me and whine and make excuses. She started blasting YouTube videos and reading stuff out loud. I told her to please be quiet, that she was irritating me, and I wanted to get this paper done. I really wanted to kick her out, but I knew if I did, she would throw a fit and cause drama, so I stuck it out.\u00a0\n\nThe final straw was this though: she went to leave, and the RA was in the hall doing things, which she came back in my room and panicked. That was when she informed me that her ESA animal was not supposed to leave her room, otherwise she and I could get fined. She never mentioned this before, and of course I was shocked and very upset. Amy told me to keep the animal in my dorm, then left quickly, so \\*she\\* wouldn\u2019t get in trouble. I\u2019m pissed at this point. I wait a few minutes then text her to get her animal, which she does a few minutes later.\u00a0\n\nI clean up the mess, try to calm down, and breathe. I wait a few days mulling my feelings over and decide that this friendship would not work. I text her a respectful message stating my feelings and shortly after blocked her on everything. I thought that was that.\u00a0\n\nBut now my other friends are calling me an asshole because:\u00a0\n\n\u201cAmy\u2019s always been this way,\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has depression, it affects her differently than it does you,\u201d (I have depression also but I don\u2019t use it as an excuse to be rude)\n\n\u201cSo many friends have dropped her without warning, she\u2019s bad at social cues.\u201d (In my opinion, if so many people before felt the same, that\u2019s a Strong hint that the problem is you)\n\nShe\u2019s a grown woman. Her behavior was and is unacceptable to me, and the fact that she refused to take responsibility for her actions as well as her ESA animal (and throw me under the bus) only proves my point.\u00a0\n\nI wholeheartedly feel I am not the asshole, but I just want to be sure.

My father in law offered to loan the money at 0% interest if we paid it off in three years. We found a car for $9K. That means $250/ per month for three years.

I ended up getting a settlement for $160K. I paid off all of my debts, except my mortgage, including what I owed my father in law.\n\nAfter paying all of my debts, we had around $75K left. My father in law texted my wife and said that \"it was a shame that we couldn't give them any money\" when they helped us out in our time of need.

This can really screw up people waiting for seats to open up since there\u2019s a wait list for some grades.  Last month we found out they got their oldest into a different public school in a different neighborhood that has a very good reputation, is attended by a lot of very wealthy families who support the school beyond regular funding, and also has specific programs for kids with learning disabilities e.g. dyslexia.  They are telling most people they were able to get into the school because their oldest needed the special programs but told us and a few others that they really got in by using a work address that they had started sending credit card statements too to seem legit.  It pisses me off that they gamed the system and cheated like that and the parents seem to thing they did nothing wrong and are entitled to the seat in that school.  Their other kids will now be able to go their too because there\u2019s a sibling policy.  There\u2019s also one less seat now for a kid who really lives in that zone or needs the special services.

        "post_body": "I've been dating this girl for 5 months, and last month, we decided to to make it official. However, she only revealed to me that she has depression last week.\n\nOne thing you have to know about me is that I'm a 22-year-old guy who can't handle negative emotions very well. She knew about this even before we started dating, because I was known as the quiet, carefree guy with a dry humor. Whenever there's drama, I'm usually ten feet away from it. She also knows I have A LOT on my plate (health, personal, financial issues), but we pushed through with the relationship believing it would be good for us.\n\nI've also previously dated a girl with depression about 2 years ago. It ended with her almost slashing her wrist in front of me (I don't know if it was a guilt trip tactic or if it was real, but I didn't want to find out), so I pretty much avoided girls with mental illness since then.\n\nWhen my new gf told me she also has depression and is also suicidal, I was speechless for about two minutes because I was really shocked. She seemed pretty chill and fun when we were hanging out, although there were times she was really down (I chalked it up to work stress), which I thought was pretty normal for people our age. I then told her I could not go through with the relationship and explained why. I tried my best to speak calmly and in the nicest possible way. I was also careful with my words, in the hopes of not triggering her. She was also pretty calm during the conversation, although I could tell she was holding back her tears. Her best friend also called me up to ask if we could give it another chance, but I told her I need time to think\n\nI really thought at the time that I had no choice but to break up with her because I couldn't give her the emotional and physical support that a person with depression demands. However, I'm now having second thoughts because she might do something harmful to herself or others as a result of the breakup, and I care enough to not want anything bad to happen to her.\n\nSo, AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend after finding out she has depression given my circumstances?\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the responses! Just so everyone knows, I am working with my ex's best friend to seek professional help for her (and maybe for me as well, because some of you think I could also use the therapy to deal with the emotions). However, seeing a therapist is hella expensive where I'm from, so we're taking our time.\n\nEDIT2: I don't know what the protocol here is, but to anyone reading this for the first time now, I've already posted an update here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a8anv0/update\\_after\\_breaking\\_up\\_with\\_girlfriend\\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a8anv0/update_after_breaking_up_with_girlfriend_with/)\n\nAgain, thanks for all your insights!",

I googled my states law and it states:\n\n&gt; Florida Statute 366.94\u2003Electric vehicle charging stations\n(3)(a)\u2003It is unlawful for a person to stop, stand, or park a vehicle that is not capable of using an electrical recharging station within any parking space specifically designated for charging an electric vehicle.\n(b)\u2003If a law enforcement officer finds a motor vehicle in violation of this subsection, the officer or specialist shall charge the operator or other person in charge of the vehicle in violation with a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as provided in s. 316.008(4) or s. 318.18.\n\nI was stuck waiting here since I didn\u2019t have enough to get me to the next one (which could be broken or in use) and it was the only one working since AAA was broken and not just busy. \n\nI called the non-emergency line to complain, I even asked two workers if they knew whose car it was, they didn\u2019t know.

Now I have to pay to park and charge in that spot, this was not a free charge while you eat/shop kind of thing. Cop comes out to say that I am right, it is illegal to block the spot and he also cannot ask me to leave because I am paying for the spot and I have a contract with ChargePoint the actual owner of the charger. \n\nSo AITA for this?

That wouldn\u2019t bother me if she was only going to stay one or two nights, but she called my dad yesterday and we don\u2019t know how long she\u2019s staying. She\u2019s already started the drive out here (she lives in another state less than six hours away), and she\u2019s making plans for her fianc\u00e9\u2019s grandmother to visit us while they\u2019re here. Presumably it\u2019s going to be at least a week. \n\nAm I the asshole for thinking that they should take the blowup bed in the loft, not me? I\u2019m going to be here until the 3rd of January, and during that time I got a part time job as an event worker, so I\u2019ll be coming home very late some nights extremely tired, and wanting to just sleep somewhere comfortable. My sister is on vacation and supposed to only be here 1-2 nights. \n\nEdit - We have a queen sized blow up bed for her to sleep on. I\u2019ve also already been kicked out of the room once this vacation, and the person who slept there was polite about coming into my space. That said, I worked unexpectedly that night and no one set up anywhere for me to sleep. I ended up having a very uncomfortable night on the couch with the only blanket I could find, and I was freezing the entire night. I guess I\u2019m still upset about that. \n\nTl;dr - I don\u2019t want to move out of the guest bedroom for someone whose going to be there for less time than I am, but I know it\u2019s going to cause a fight if I don\u2019t.

        "post_body": "I made an account to specifically ask this because I am unsure if I was an asshole last night .\n\nOkay, so yesterday while I was at work , the first guy I ever had sex with texted me that he was in my city . I had messaged him earlier this year saying that he could visit me the week of the the 24th , but it seems like he came to Nyc early . This is my finals week and my job has lots of intense days so I\u2019ve been putting in lots of work both inside and outside of the classroom. When I got his text I responded that we could meet up for a few hours as I have work to do. He agreed and met me at my apt at 7:30pm.\n\nThe context was clear : we both were interested in having sex with each other . It had been 4+ years since we\u2019ve seen each other but we\u2019ve been in contact every now and then we would be in contact hence why I told him he could visit me the week of the 24th.\n\nSo we hang out a bit , have sex and cuddle for a little. I start putting my clothes on so that I could get some work done . I ask him what his next move was and he told me he was just going to stay with me. I was shocked because I had not planned for him to stay over and very much wanted my space to study in peace for my finals and just be in my own space alone. The Sex was great but I love alone time and I was very much craving that after he fucked the shit out of me. I expressed this to him and he responded, \u201cI won\u2019t get in your way, I\u2019m just going to be chillin here \u201c\nMe: \u201cno, but that is in my way. I wasn\u2019t expecting you to sleep over because you didn\u2019t tell me you were\u201d\n\nHim : \u201cwell, I don\u2019t have anywhere else to go\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI thought your frat brothers were in the city ? If you needed to sleep over why didn\u2019t you tell me in advance ? I would have arranged for us to meet at another time when I didn\u2019t have so much work to do. I was about to cook for myself , take a shower, study and do my own thing\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be here this late , and now that I am , I was just going to stay here. I won\u2019t be in your way \u201c\n\nMe: \u201cyes, but I was not expecting you to stay here ...I\u2019m waking up early and am working late ...\u201d\n  \nHim: \u201cI can also wake up early , have no where else to go\u201d\n\nSo I let him stay over but I was very annoyed . I stayed up extra late and left all the lights on in my room in hopes that he would eventually figure it out and leave. I listened to class recordings and tried so hard to be a nuance because I very much wanted to be alone. I cooked for myself and did not offer him any food , as I had not gone shopping because, again, I was not expecting him . It\u2019s bad enough that I have roommates that I feel crowd my space , but now this guy was literally all up in my space . \n\nI was finally ready to go to bed. He\u2019s 6\u20192\u201d ex football player so he\u2019s taking up most of my full size bed . When I get in, he tries to cuddle with me but I actually don\u2019t like cuddling . I had my alarm go off at 5am to get him out early so I could at least enjoy some sleep alone in my bed . When the alarm went off I told him it was time for him to go. He responded , \u201cI\u2019ll leave when you leave \u201c  but that\u2019s not what I wanted ! I wanted him out of my bed . I tell him I have yoga at 6 and want to get ready. He says ok , gets ready and head out.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to be by myself after coitus? For trying to put him out even when he expressed he had no where else to go?

Upon asking about it she said she liked to think of me and her as the people in porn she watched. No big deal there, they're actors or anonymous couples. She then continued to explain she also likes to visit sites like Omegle or ChatRoulette and pretend to be other people and talk to other people. Word for word she said \"it gets me horny, idk\". She explained that it's basically like porn, she's just using it to get off and since she's just having sexual talks with strangers and pretending to be someone else it's not bad. She also explained it's only at times I'm unavailable and that she \"thinks of me when she's talking to them\". I told her no, she shouldn't continue to do that, and that the difference is that she is interacting with another person, and whether she's pretending to be a different person or not she's still sexting someone else to get off. \n\nMy issue is that if she needs someone to sext or whatever she can just wait for me to get home from work and message or call me, and I explained this and how it amounts to emotional cheating, but she seemed kind of dejected by the whole thing. I also explained that I'm not super hurt or mad over it because I can see how she came to the conclusion that it's okay, but it's too weird and seems to easily escalatable for me to be comfortable with.\n\nSo my question is, am I the asshole for not approving of my GF's weird fetish when it's online, distanced from her actual self, and is with people she is incredibly unlikely to meet, with no video or other real info exchange.

        "title": "AITA for thinking a mentally disabled student is ruining my college games club?",
        "post_body": "**The neutral explanation**\n\nThere is a games club that I am a member of at my college. Its members consist of about 20 members, both men and women who meet about once a week (usually not all 20 at once) to play various board / table top games. Since my joining the club 2 years ago, I have risen in the ranks to being someone who helps organize the game nights now every third week or so. (The specific game I run will be discussed later). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently (this past semester) a student who is mentally disabled was encouraged to join the club. I was in no way opposed to his joining, because I genuinely enjoy introducing the fun of tabletop games to people. I often see people that think board games only go as far as monopoly, so its great to expand their horizons into thinks like Munchkin, Zombicide, Sycthe, etc etc. The main game that I run is Dungeons and Dragons about once or twice a month (It\u2019s actually a different game system, but everyone knows D&amp;D, so let\u2019s go with that for simplicity)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo describe this student (let\u2019s call him Jim) I\u2019d say he is not completely unable, he\u2019s mostly just slower than the usual person and has a bit of a temper. He is often accompanied by a \u201cbuddy\u201d around campus who helps him with stuff. He is easily upset if something doesn\u2019t go his way. He doesn\u2019t throw tantrums exactly, but he gets angry, loud, and very occasionally, will throw something in frustration (small objects. He doesn\u2019t flip tables or anything). So with that explanation, you might see where this is going.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, so to get into the meat of my issue with Jim, I decided to split the explanation up into two versions. A simple, non-nerd version that gets the point across and a full on nerd explanation of the situation. I suggest reading the first one, but I wanted to at least write out the full version somewhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Non-Nerd Version**\n\nI\u2019ve been running a longer story with my players (5 people before Jim) for about a year and a half now. Sessions require some prep time on my part, making sure I know the player characters, where the players are planning to go, and trying to think of interesting ways to get everyone involved in the story. About mid-way through this past semester, Jim was invited into the game. We played a few practice games with him that went okay. I genuinely enjoy seeing a new player get invested in their character and come up with interesting ideas on how to progress, but issue started to arise when Jim actually joined the campaign. He wouldn\u2019t allow his character to be hurt or be challenged in any way. This lead to parts of the game being derailed completely because his \u201cI can\u2019t lose\u201d character would just effortlessly win every time because his \u201cbuddy\u201d and other sympathetic players would insist that I \u201cjust let it slide. We\u2019re all here to have fun and this is fun for him.\u201d This finally boiled over in the last session before winter break where a plot twist a player and myself were building up to was \u201cruined\u201d because Jim\u2019s character pulled a \u201cI can\u2019t lose\u201d move. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst and foremost, I just want everyone to have fun. I\u2019m not going to flip the table and throw a tantrum just because the players aren\u2019t following the story I wrote. I\u2019ve read and seen those kinds of Dungeon Masters and that kind of behavior is embarrassing and just not fun to be around. I\u2019m not going to just stop running the game, but I\u2019m starting to wish I could.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m not alone in this feeling. Two of the players also feel like the game is lesser now that Jim has joined. (one of them was part of that failed plot twist). We are quiet about it because we are concerned about being labeled as assholes for being upset over a disabled student. I used to look forward to the game sessions over winter break, but now I\u2019m just putting together the prep work as more of a chore now. The player who had his plot twist messed up is even thinking of leaving the game since it leaves him a convenient out now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm mostly just curious if we are being entitled assholes for being upset over our tabletop RPG being run differently as to how we want it to be. As I said, some people are having a lot of fun, but there are others who are considering dropping out of the game entirely because it has changed so much now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou don\u2019t need to read the longer version below, but it does go into more explanation about me and my players specific issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nMentally disabled player doesn\u2019t want to play games by the rules. Makes me and other players not want to be a part of the club anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The (far too long) Nerd Version**\n\nBefore getting into Jim as a player, I\u2019ll explain a few things about how we played our games:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, so as a Dungeon Master I try to get as involved with my players as I can. Each of their character\u2019s backstories are woven into the pre-written campaign through various methods (flashbacks, custom Non Player Characters, etc) . I work with everyone individually as much as they want, through email or in person hang outs to get an idea of where they want their character to go, or even if they want to retire the character to play as a new one. (Characters are retired either through death or other plot stuff. It depends on what the player and I think will work best (This is also done rarely. We don't really allow character retirement until the character has been around awhile or, in extreme cases, the character just doesn't work for the party)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe also used to run our games with a \u201cwhat happens happens\u201d kind of thing. If a character dies due to a dumb player move, then that character is dead. We try not to \u201cret-con\u201d events just because a player regrets a previous move. We viewed it like being upset over an early move in chess and wanting to \u201cgo back\u201d and undo that move so you don\u2019t lose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let\u2019s get to the issues with Jim as a player:\n\n* Bored with my character \u2013 Jim never plays the same character twice. When we first started, I helped him make up a character. I asked what kind of character he wanted to play ( Kind of like \u201cDo you want to me a knight with a sword, a wizard with magic, or a quick-handed thief?\u201d). He had a lot of fun making up a character and a basic backstory for him. I was able to find a way to weave this new character into the existing plot and the first session went\u2026 okay. But then. The next session he didn\u2019t want to play his character anymore. He wanted to play as someone else. The more sympathetic players just brushed it off, but it\u2019s frustrating to both me and some other players that a member of the party is constantly switching out. It made everyone not want to interact with that character on a roleplaying level because he was so inconsistent.\n* Everything proof shield \u2013 Jim now doesn\u2019t allow his character to be injured in any way. Combats involving Jim\u2019s characters are always a mess. Let\u2019s say a goblin tries to hit him with a spear. It rolls high enough to hit, so Jim should take damage. However, Jim will say \u201cI block it!\u201d and will just repeat this over and over until I give up and just say something along the lines of \u201cyou manage to block the spear with your shield at the last second.\u201d The sympathetic players will often congratulate him on his \u201cquick thinking\u201d and such, which again annoys the other players.\n* \u00b7 Unlimited Cosmic Powers \u2013 Okay so the last bullet point might really only affects his character if it stopped there, but of course it doesn\u2019t. Jim\u2019s character also has unlimited ability when it comes to any problem the party faces. This essentially boils down to Jim not wanting to roll dice. He just dictates what he wants his character to do and expects it to just be done. \u201cI climb the wall. I hit him with my sword. I heal him\u201d As a DM I usually let players police their own abilities (We look up the rules if something doesn\u2019t feel right) but with Jim there\u2019s just no boundaries. His character can just do *Anything* he wants without fail. Early on, I tried to play with him like usual (\u201cYou try to hit him, but he manages to nimbly doge out of your reach\u201d) however, this lead to him getting angry and sometimes throwing game pieces or just storming off. Often leading to the sympathetic players giving me looks of disapproval and being told I should \u201cjust let him do it\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay so the stage is now set for what I call\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Final Straw**\n\nI\u2019m not going to bore you with a complete recap of the story of our campaign thus far, but to give the important details: The party was at a natural conclusion for this part of the campaign before winter break (think final episode of a season before a hiatus) and a player and I had something up our sleeve to end the session. He had been secretly planning with me for the last few months on having his character defect against the party. (A reminder, I do this with all my players. They all have backstory and character motivation that the other players don\u2019t know, so it was a treat to have this tidbit of information under my hat for this long)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were both excited to finally drop this twist on the party and had a plan on how to do it in an interesting way. The best way I can think to explain how it was supposed to go is to just put up an outline of what we were planning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurncoat Character (TC)\n\nDungeon Master (DM)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSetting: A camp that party has set up at the base of a mountain several days after defeating the boss of this part of the campaign. Party consists of the 6 players and a NPC. They now have what they think is a very important item with them that is left with the NPC for plot reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTC: \u201cOn my turn for night watch I cast silence, targeted on center of camp\u201d (Creates area where no sound it made) \u201c I make my way to the NPC\u2019s tent and stand over him for several minutes, deciding if I should do it or not. I pull a knife from my belt and make my decision. I kill him and take the item. I walk back out into the center of camp, throwing the bloody knife away in disgust, and consider if I should leave the letter I wrote. With a shake of my head I decide its better not to try to justify myself.  I prepare to teleport to (town party visited long ago).\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDM: \u201c(Party member who had close relationship with TC), you wake up for some reason. You don\u2019t hear anything strange, but then you realize you can\u2019t hear anything.\u201d (party member decides what to do. Most likely leaves their tent)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cAs you lift the flap you see TC preparing a teleportation spell, a bloody knife lays in the dirt nearby him.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Let player make decision, but for simplicity lets say he goes for a tackle)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTC: \u201cI mouth the words \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d as I vanish, dispelling the silence as I go\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Tackling player dives through empty air. Rest of the party wakes up confused to find a murder and an item stolen by a long time friend)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain apologies for the nerd here. This is a shorter hurriedly written outline to what we wanted to do, but I wanted to write it out to give context to what Jim did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo as written this was meant to be a \u201csequel hook\u201d for the players and get them riled up for when we come back after winter break.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now, here\u2019s how it actually went:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot Twist: Jim Edition**\n\n(TC gets to the murder part) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJim: \u201cI get rid of the silence and grab TC. (Jim\u2019s character is a non-magic fighter and his tent is across camp ie he can't dispell magic and wouldn't be able to just leap up and grab him)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo shorten things here: I was guilt-ed into \u201cjust let him do it\u201d with the grabbing and dispelling, as I planned to still let TC escape (somehow. I was going to have to improvise hard) so that our plot twist could still technically happen. But things went differently:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJim: \u201cWhy\u2019d you kill him?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTC: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you. He\u2019ll kill them if I do. (vague reference to an antagonist that party has encountered and to character backstory that hasn\u2019t been revealed yet)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJim: \u201cYou killed NPC and now you have to die\u201d (to DM) \u201cI kill him\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Table starts to argue over this. Non-sympathetic players are against because this would mean Jim can just decide to kill other players while sympathetic players are for because \u201cTC already killed someone so this makes it even\u201d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(I try to get a combat going, so that it could still be an interesting end to the \"season\". Characters started taking sides. Was going to be a \"Captain America: Civil War\" scenario on our hands which would possibly have been more interesting... )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(But I was eventually overruled by the sympathetic players who just let Jim kill TC and end the session with this mess of a scenario. TC was annoyed but kept quiet about it and the other non-sympathetic players were more visibly annoyed that rules were so blatantly ignored. They also caught on to the twist that was happening and were interested in seeing where it was going)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have talked about it since, and overall, they are all pretty pissed. None of us want to come forward with our complaints because we don\u2019t want to be seen as assholes over this disabled student, but the way he is playing this game is derailing it for most of the players. As a DM I try to remain neutral in player arguments, but Jim is even being allowed to overrule me. Some players are still having fun, which I guess is the important thing, but it is frustrating to others to see months and months of work just be thrown away to let one person have their own fun. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm mostly just curious if we are being entitled assholes for being upset over our tabletop RPG being run differently as to how we want it to be. As I said, some people are having a lot of fun, but there are others who are considering dropping out of the game entirely because it has changed so much now. ",

        "post_body": "So, when my wife and I got married she wanted to keep her last name for personal reasons. I had no issue with this and, as far as I knew, neither did my parents. Our two sons have both our last names hyphenated. However, when we receive anything from one of my parents (they are divorced so it's separately) it will be addressed to the family as just my last name and nowhere is hers listed. My father also never uses our sons full last name and uses my last name as a nickname for our oldest. This has been going on for many years and it really bothers my wife as we have been married for twelve years at this point and they are both fully aware of our names. \n\nAnyway, we recently got a Christmas card from my dad and it was addressed using only my last name as the family name. So I decided to just directly address the issue and called him. He seemed to be upset that I had asked him to include my wife's name and to use our sons full last name. He also said that now he would need to return a gift that he got us which was a customer tree ornament that had the family name on it (just mine and not hers or hyphenated). It turned into a bit of an argument and then what seemed like an annoyed apology. Then I call my mom and it went very similarly but she ended up crying.\n\nI feel like this should not be that big of an issue for them to acknowledge her name or our sons proper names when referring to our family but apparently it is. I don't think I'm being an asshole... Am I?\n\nTL;DR.  Asked my parents to include my wife's name and sons hyphenated last names and made my mom cry.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments and discussion going on! One point of clarification I wanted to add is that this is not the first time in the 12 years it has been brought up. Mostly it has been my wife correcting them on the names when it comes up, but this is the first time that I directly talked to them about the names.",

About 3 months ago, my little brother [13] made a joke at my expense and we all had a great laugh about it. Something clicked in his mind that this was finally the way for people to laugh at the jokes he makes, which admittedly usually fall flat. \n\nFor the past 3 months, every day, it's been joke after joke, and they've gotten meaner and meaner. Personal subjects he should only know as a brother, things that I find deeply offensive. I've talked to my Dad about it, but he says that he doesn't mean any harm and that I should laugh along, because he doesn't get much opportunities like this at school.\n\nHe has a pretty heavy speech disorder which has lead to some underdeveloped social and learning schools by the way school has treated him. He does not, however, have any specific disorder related to his actual mental state or demeanor. He thinks exactly like everyone else does.\n\nMy Dad's been laughing at these jokes as well, which I could understand as encouragement, after 3 months it's getting harder and harder to see as anything other than disgustingly cathartic to him. \n\nIt's been like this every day. For 3 fucking months. \n\nAnd it's getting really hard to feel any enjoyment when I'm at home, because I feel like I'm not welcome in my own house. I have a year and a half until I graduate high school and I can move out.

Last night he made a joke about my sexuality, which got a humiliating chuckle out of my father, the first person I came out to. I wanted to scream, but didn't.\n\nI want to pause the game next time, and fucking demand that he stops and everyone treat me with a little more respect, but I'm worried that I'll be being a dick for yelling at my brother, because this might be a coping mechanism for him.\n\nI also might be making too much of a deal about this, or it might be just be dismissed that way.\n\nWould I be an asshole for asserting myself and calling my little brother out on his bullshit?

He went back to his home country to visit her last week and he knows she will die soon. A year ago he saw his godmother die from cancer and this has affected him greatly.\n\nThe way he is dealing with this grief is to drink a lot, smoke weed and isolate himself emotionally from anyone. He will still go out to meet his friends but I know that he is not talking to them about what he is going through, but just partying. \n\nMy bf knows I previously escaped an abusive relationship with someone who had mental health issues worsened by a cannabis addiction. I was diagnosed with PTSD later on. For this reason, I ask my bf not to get high around me (I feel this is reasonable as we only see eachother about once a week). One time he rolled a spliff in secret in the bathroom and lied about it when I confronted him. He later apologised. \n\nMy father was also an alcoholic who had been in rehab several times and constantly threatened suicide. My bf also knows this.\n\nI understand that he prefers space so I have constantly reassured him that I am here to talk but I will not push him. He has cried a couple of times and i have comforted him, staying up all night and trying my best to reassure him he is not alone.\n\nOther than these infrequent moments of him letting me in, he will usually behave like an asshole. If you were not to know that he is suffering so much, you would just think he was a shitty bf by the way he behaves. \n\nFor 1 out of the 3 moths we have been dating he has been incredibly distant and uncaring. He rarely wants to meet and when we do he seems very uninterested and selfish. He says this is because he goes into a shell when he grieves. I constantly do nice things for him (helping him with a job presentation written in my native language and not his, making him cute gifts, coming to his flat so that he doesn\u2019t have to come to mine, asking about his day etc.), but this is never reciprocated.\n\nUnfortunately I do also suffer from anxiety and depression. Recently I went through 3 days or so of intense suicidal idealisation to the point of planning. Despite me trying to reach out to my bf about my depression, albeit cryptically, I was met with replies like \u201cyou\u2019ll be fine. Think of people who are much worse off like me\u201d. I have not mentioned it since, and he has chastised me for being closed off regarding this topic. I have explained that I felt shut down the last time and he has apologised. \n\nA few days ago he was flying back from his country and we had planned to meet. Messaging me from the airport, he tells me the flight is delayed. I had cancelled plans with my friends to spend some much coveted time with him and asked him to tell me when the flight would take off.\n\nA few hours later of waiting, I message him and it turns out he has already landed and is on his way to his flat. I told him I was disappointed he didn\u2019t update me since I was waiting on him but he just told me he was in a rush and he was sorry. He told me he was too sad to go work the following day and would call in sick, however asked if I wanted to go with him to a birthday party that night. A little taken aback that he wanted to go out, I still agreed. He said he was running late so I could meet him there. This was the final straw for me since I did know these people and I did not want to turn up to a flat I\u2019ve never been before for someone\u2019s birthday i don\u2019t know on my own. My bf also told me he was feeling self-destructive \u201clike when [his] godmother died\u201d and planned to drink and smoke a lot and that I could not change his mind about this. \n\nI told him this would be upsetting for me and I didn\u2019t want to go. The next 2 days after that he was unresponsive to my messages. I begged him to talk to me about what was going on and how he felt about the relationship and he refused. Because he made it impossible to meet and talk I broke up with him via text.\n\nI am very open to the possibility that AIMA. Unfortunately I have a warped sense of what is ok in a relationship due to previous abuse, so I find it hard to tell if I\u2019m being too sensitive and selfish or if I\u2019m too forgiving.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, that\u2019s a story for another day.\n\nAnyway, this all goes back to May of 2018. We were both Juniors in High school at the time. I\u2019m guessing I was at work since I wasn\u2019t able to intervene in the situation. She had invited one of her two best friends to her house to play video games and watch a movie. Let\u2019s call these friends Sara and Kyle. \n\nI never really had trusted Kyle because he was the very definition of a man whore. While he is a very charismatic guy, he typically uses it to get girls into bed with him. He has also bragged about it to me. Even though I didn\u2019t trust the guy with women I care about, I let it go because I trusted my GF. \n\nAnyway, after awhile, all of them are pretty tired and decide to take a nap. Sara falls asleep pretty quickly but Kyle and my GF are still awake just laying there. At one point, Kyle starts seductively rubbing her stomach. She is concerned but thinks he is just asleep. Then he starts to grab her boobs and she gets out of the bed and cries in another room.\n\nThat\u2019s where that story ends. This was all 6 months from when she did eventually tell me. We are now in August of 2018 and she tells me this story plus the fact that the person that helped her through it most was this other guy friend of hers. I will say she has known this other guy friend longer but I was her boyfriend. She had told the other guy friend shortly after it happened.\n\nMy GF would later go to therapy for this (she had told me it was to help her overcome her fear of heights). When she did tell me that August day, I was slightly conflicted about how I should respond. Admittedly, I did tell her I was kinda hurt that I was just learning about this but I decided to do whatever I could to comfort and help her through it to which she told me there wasn\u2019t much I could do now.\n\nNow that we are broken up (and don\u2019t take her cheating later into consideration with your responses) I\u2019m looking back on the situation and wondering if that was a red flag or if I\u2019m just turning her traumatic experience into something selfish now. \n\nTL;DR: my (now ex for outside reasons) GF was sexually harassed by a friend she had known a long time and didn\u2019t tell me about it for 6 months.

        "post_body": "I met my fiance 2 years ago and our love is like a fairy tale, everything seemed so perfect. I met his son when he was 5 years old, he's 7 now. His son, who I will call Josh, was very open and warm to me in the beginning. My fiance was never the best at being a dad to him, but when I came in the picture we changed that. I made sure we had meals together when I was around and we went on trips to the zoo and museum frequently. I would make sure they had \"Josh and Dad\" days, and I would often take him out by myself to arcades or the pool. Everything was going well, but I always noticed defiance in Josh. He fights everything. He lies about everything. His mom says he's 100x worse at her house, and I know there is some tension in their home so I expected that.\n\nJosh is very destructive, more than the average 7 year old I believe. I invited my fiance to come live with me after about a year of dating. I have two extra rooms so I figured we could fix one up for Josh. Josh comes over every weekend, and every weekend piece of my furniture is either broken completely or destroyed in some way (colored on, buttons ripped off, holes poked or cut in things). When confronted about these things he will lie and lie even if we caught him in the act. Josh will steal from his friends, from his school, and from us. Josh stole $100 from my purse last week when his dad confronted him he said \"Well, if I can't have it, you can't either!\" And ripped the bill in half.\n\nJosh is violent, I have had to put all his play guns/swords too high for him to reach because when he has them he shoots people in the face or beats them with his swords. We had my grandparents over for dinner one time and he managed to get his guns and shoot them in the face during dinner. He is often screaming that he wants to kill things. My dog is currently staying at my mother's because when Josh comes over he will lock the dog in the bathroom or outside for hours on end. Josh would chase my dog with big sticks and everytime he walked in the door my (usually very friendly) dog would run away or pee. \n\nMy fiance and I recently found out I was pregnant. Josh acted out tremendously when he was told. I ended up losing the baby 3 months in and Josh was so happy about this... Often telling me \"I'm glad the baby died. I don't want any siblings.\" Or \"It's good that your body can't make babies right. I hate babies.\" This was basically the breaking point for me. We have tried tough love, open arms, therapy, all of it. Nothing seems to change or get through to this boy. I understand he's 7 and coming from a broken home is always damaging. But, at the end of the day he's not biologically mine and I have been feeling more and more disconnected and really feel no love for him at this point. Not only is it unfair for me, but it's unfair for my fiance AND his son. It's exhausting and fills me with anxiety whenever my husband leaves to pick him up. I feel like I hold my breath all weekend. \n\nI would never make ANYONE choose between their child and their SO. And even if I did, I would be disappointed if someone chose their SO over their kid. I think I need to leave, I don't think I have the emotional capacity to stay and deal with it. I want nice things again, I want my dog, I want to have kids someday. AITA?",

I'm a scholarship student (I get full aid since my mom makes 45k a year) and I've been attending the school since 7th grade. \n\nAnyway, in 9th grade, I almost got kicked out of the school. I'm naturally a procrastinator. I was able to make it work, kinda. What happened is that I couldn't seriously study unless it was *the day of the test* (the exception being history, since I love history). My strategy was to waste time everyday on my phone, jerking off, playing clash of clans. Then I'd wake up really early on the test and study. At first this worked, and I aced the tests. Then the tests got more constant, and I began doing this almost everday. I got sleep deprived, my grades dropped. I was almost kicked out, but I convinced my history teacher to convince the school to give me a chance. This next part is probably stereotypical as hell, but I decided to change my life. I looked at how I was then- unproductive, skinny as hell, unpopular. I decided I had to change all that. I limited my jacking off to once every 2 weeks, joinrf the debate team, signed up with the rowing team, started looking up productivity tips, all that. I asked my only friend at the time to take my phone from me at my at 7 AM until 9 PM, so I could focus on all my stuff. \n\nBy this year (11th grade), I'm pretty popular and start dating my current girlfriend. Honestly I see a lot of me in her, even though she's the next level: never goes to class, has a 1.7 GPA, not involved in any clubs, and has a 1530 SAT on her 1st try with no preparation. Yeah. She's the smart but lazy kid on steroids. She only goes to the school honestly because her rich dad is a huge donor. \n\nAnd this frustrates me. A lot of people stereotype her as a basic bitch or legit stupid blonde. She's one of the smartest people I know, but doesn't gaf and spends her time on her phone out with her friends. Those aren't wrong, but she should spend less time on them. She has the potential but she's wasting it idling away.\n\nI tried convincing, pleading, begging her to do something. I didn't expect it to work- didn't for me- but I hoped. Well, it didn't. So yesterday afternoon, we were hanging out. When I was leaving, I swiped it. At crew practice this morning, I threw it in the river.\n\nI don't regret doing it, but just now I was talking to her, and was so panicked. Like almost in tears and screaming type of panic.

I never asked anyone to write my name.  I never told anyone to write my name.  No one ever asked me if i wanted them to write my name.

Then suddenly a wild mom-zilla appeared in full battle gear \u201cHOW DARE YOU?! GET AWAY FROM HIM!\u201d in a relatively crowded restaurant. I told her that the kid was taking the purse so she told me that i should let the kid do whatever he wants. As i was saying it Mr badass dad also walked up and started lecturing me and half-threatened to fight me and their family was giving me the looks like i had just murdered god or something. Then my friends came around me so the tension got diffused a little, but i was getting weird looks from my friends too. Is doing this really such an ungodly course of action?",

During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rights to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.",

He cheated on me with one of his coworkers (who worked FOR him and knew me when we were married) and I didn't find our for a year until I was humiliated at a work event when someone thought we were in an \"open\" relationship. Now we're divorced but my ex is living it up with his new wife (the woman he slept with) and basically only see our 2 kids twice a year. He's objectively not a good father but he has money so now he's trying to buy their love.\n\nLast month he called me and told me that he and his woman wanted to go to Japan for Christmas with my kids who are 10 and 13 and love Japanese stuff. I was not invited. They'd play a happy little family for 2 weeks while my ex would put them up in the fanciest hotels and take them for expensive dinners. So he asked me to ask the kids what they wanted since they've spent Christmas with their grandparents (my parents) since they were babies. I honestly felt sick to my stomach. He KNOWS how much the kids love Japanese stuff with their toys and tv shows and it is SO OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get them to come and spend time with him and his barely legal wife because otherwise they wouldn't give him the time of day.\n\nI ended up not telling the kids what their dad said, just that he wasn't going to be in the country for the holidays because he's off gallivanting with his new sidepiece. I told my ex that the kids said no to his offer and would prefer to spend Christmas in town like always. He was disappointed and didn't ask any questions but I felt like he knew he had crossed a line by asking anyways so he didn't put up a fight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently told a good friend all this and she said I shouldn't have done it.

        "post_body": "So unbelievably pissed off right now.  I really do hope that there is some part of this situation I am not seeing, and that I am the asshole, because as it stands I am ready to cut this branch of my family tree off and never speak to them again.\n\nMy (female) cousin has 3 kids (actually she has 4 but she gave one of them up for adoption when the kid was a teenager.  But that's neither here nor there.)  The two older girls are preteens and the youngest boy is 6.  Anyway she and her live-in bf have been having money troubles all year.\n\nI will admit, the two older girls were OK when they were younger but they are both turning out snarky and sarcastic and I don't have a lot of love for them.  But the 6YO is a sweetheart.  I visited for Thanksgiving and saw that his mom and her bf are constantly screeching at him and giving him punishments for the stupidest of slights: \"you left your coloring book on the kitchen table so go to your room without lunch\" or \"you didn't immediately say Yes Ma'am when I called your name so now you can't play outside\".  I spent Thanksgiving Day playing with him and I love the little guy.  He's so creative and bounding with energy.\n\nCousin's mom told me that Cousin was having to delay Christmas this year because they didn't have money to buy gifts.  (My aunt is on disability and had already stopped giving presents of any kind years ago when her children became adults.)  She said my cousin's older girls knew that they were going to get gifts in January instead of December and were OK with that.  HOWEVER.  The 6YO still believes in Santa Claus, and so would see his friends and neighbors getting presents from Santa and think Santa \"skipped\" him.  They were going to deal with the issue by telling him there is no Santa Claus.  (I was horrified at this.  What a terrible way to find out.)\n\nApparently a local charity was giving away used bikes, and the 6YO was looking forward to possibly getting one, but his name wasn't drawn and he was disappointed.  His Christmas letter to Santa only mentioned the bike.\n\nI found a decent bike online for $100 that would be there in time for Christmas.  I asked my aunt if she could put it together (she's handy) and she said yes, so I went ahead and ordered it to be shipped to her house, as she is their neighbor and I didn't want 6YO to see it before Christmas morning.  Note that I normally don't order anything for my cousins and vice versa, because there are so darn many of us.\n\nI called and told Cousin that a bike for 6YO would be arriving at her mom's house.  She was pissed.  Why didn't I order something for the other two girls as well.  I told her money was tight with me too, but I really wanted the 6YO to have Christmas magic a little while longer, while the other girls would be happy with presents later.  \n\nShe said that 6YO would be calling me to tell me thank you.  I told her to please tell him Santa sent it, don't mention me at all.  That's the whole point of the gift.  She insisted that 6YO is going to know I sent it.  Wouldn't take no for an answer.\n\nI tracked the package on Fed Ex and saw that it had arrived at my aunt's.  I called to ask how the setup was going.  Aunt was very vague, said Cousin's BF had borrowed her tool set earlier (\"I forgot\"), so she had allowed them to take the bike box home with them.  OK, fine.\n\nCousin texted me later that BF was having trouble putting the bike together.  OK...\n\nThen she texted \"the bike is missing some parts\".  ?? It's brand new!  But I guess that's a possibility.  I asked her to send me a list of what parts were missing, and I could talk to the manufacturer and get them to send spares.  (she never did.  Claimed she wasn't sure what they were.)\n\nThen she texted that since the bike is missing parts, she's not going to give it to 6YO until after Christmas, when she can fix it, because it's unridable and it would be cruel to give him something he can't ride.  !!!\n\nTHEN the kicker.  Today, 3 days before Christmas, she texted me that she had sold the bike to her neighbor for $20.  I told her that the whole \"bike is missing parts\" thing was bullshit, finally she said \"well it's also because 6YO got in trouble for hitting his sister\" and was being punished.  I was PISSED.  She told me I had no right to interfere with her parenting, or her punishments, or her plan to \"make the little shit grow up\" by telling him the truth about Santa, that I was being mean to her daughters by only buying the youngest one a gift, and that I should have just sent cash but \"you wanted to play the family hero\".

I also live with my mother and younger sister.\n\nMy mother has made it clear time and time again that she will no longer help me with adult problems. Which is why I do not have health or car insurance at the moment. And since all of my belongings are in her house, she expects me to give her $150 of each of my $370 paychecks. And so I do to prevent fights between us.\n\nCurrently since the school district is on Winter break, I have two weeks to hang out with my friends who are back from various colleges/unis and my SO who leaves Monday for Mexico, he won\u2019t be back til after New Year. \n\nAnyways, my mom told me that in order for me to leave the house I needed to clean my room and the kitchen. I planned to leave early in the morning to my SO\u2019s house to have a full day of hanging out. So I cleaned very late at night and decided to not do dishes so I didn\u2019t risk waking up my light sleeper of a mom.\n\nAnd instead I:\n\n-Cleaned my room\n- Cleaned the bathroom and its mirror\n- Took out the bathroom trash\n- Took out the trash from the trash can\n- Fed the cats, dog, and my leopard gecko\n- Cleaned the living room which was a disaster thanks to my sister\n- and even washed some of my clothing\n\nOnce I finished, and patted myself on the back, I took off to my SO\u2019s house. No too long after I got an unhappy text from my mother. She was disappointed that the kitchen was still a mess even though my sister was the reason it was a gross mess in the first place.\n\nI decided I had enough. My mother does not help me in any way. I pay to live there and I never eat the food in the house because there is none. We are a struggling family. I take care of myself and my SO who doesn\u2019t have a job, he only attends college.\n\nI told my mom everything I did to clean and that I no longer wanted to come home for Christmas. Every year Christmas is the same, my aunt and my cousin\u2019s grandmother only take interest in what my cousin has to say. They adore her and all I get in conversation is a \u201cHi, how are you.\u201d Before the conversation is focused back on my cousin.\n\nWhich is only worsened by the fact my mother only talks about my sister and I to them when it\u2019s about negative things. Every Christmas I feel neglected and uncared for. \n\nMy mother told me to grow up, and that I needed to give her positive things to say. She also told me that she would take any money they intended on giving me and tell them to return all presents they had for me.\n\nI\u2019m a college kid who\u2019s working hard to help those around me. I\u2019ve asked for nothing all year, and don\u2019t even desire Christmas presents. All I wish for is my mother to buy the proper medicine for our dog who is growing older and older. I\u2019ve not been to jail or even messed around with drugs. I\u2019m decent at college and I\u2019m fucking great at my job. I may not be an all star child but she\u2019s starting to make me feel like trash.\n\nI told her that she isn\u2019t my mother, and quite frankly I never want to see her again. \n\n\nTL;DR - My mother got mad that I didn\u2019t clean the entire house and told me that I needed to grow up and become a better child even though I\u2019ve never asked her for any help or thing and I give her $300 every month for rent.\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, I am not complaining about paying $300/month to my mother. In fact I send the money to her without hesitation every check. We\u2019re in troubling times in my family and I don\u2019t need the money for much. What bothers me is the fact that she told me she doesn\u2019t have anything nice to say about me even before I was rude to her. \n\nI help my mother and I clean up after myself, unlike my sister who makes most of the mess and doesn\u2019t pay to live there either (she works as well) or clean around the house. Since my mother never gets after my sister to clean, I clean up after my sister a good majority of the time. And, that is why I am upset with her.

He doesn' tolerate anything he would see as \"less than the best in anything\" around his friends, going as far as stealing (even tho something as cheap as a chocolate bar) just to prove \"he can do whatever he wants and is the coolest for that\"\n\nWe were at the pool today where he and 2 other friends are trowing water at another friend.

He then mounts on the kid and gives him a neck armlock (again dont know the proprer term sry), and i rushed in to separate them.\n\nFeeling humiliated by a 13yo kid (it was a beautifull sweep), he tried to engage again so i pushed him away.

        "post_body": "This is in response to a post where someone was wanting more \"assholes stepping forward\" posts.  I believe I'm the asshole here, but I've seen enough instances where my morality differs from this subreddit's consensus, that maybe this will be seen as righteous indignation.\n\n\nA Warcraft story that only gamers are going to really understand, but I'll try to explain it so anyone can participate. This is something that happened a few years back and it's fueled by a lot of ego and bias on my part. I acknowledge this was a retaliatory dick move, the real question is \"was it justified\"\n\n\nA little background, in Warcraft, there's two main types of players, those that prefer to fight players, and those that prefer to fight bots (computer control enemies).  There is a lot of friction between the two types of player and the game has a tendency to force them together when certain rewards are only available from a specific activity. This is one such instance.\n\n\nI group up with four random players I don't know and we go to a dungeon.  Early on, the party leader mentions how he's there for a super rare mount, and that he's been rerunning that dungeon all month and can't get it to drop.  I don't care about mounts, I generally don't care about anything that doesn't help me kill players more effectively, so I have genuinely negative interest in this mount.  A short while into the dungeon the leader goes off on me when he notices I don't have the optimal raider build and am completely geared towards killing players, a very common sentiment I get from raiders who are often the \"you will play this very specific way, or you are less than garbage\" type.  I just take it, and keep my head down.  He doesn't go so far as to throw me out.  \n\n\nLater on, we get to a boss that wipes the entire party.  I am the last one alive, and the boss is at ~25%.  When it turns to me, I blow all my defensive abilities including three I specifically only had access to because I was a PvPer.  I manage to down the boss alone,... right before collapsing from poison damage.  But the boss is downed, the entire party is singing my praises and the leader just goes super quiet.  And I pulled it off specifically because I didn't play like the elitist wanted me to.\n\n\nNow, this is the optimal outcome.  I proved the viability of my playstyle and the other guy is eating crow...  but this wasn't enough for me.  When we got back to the boss, the mount I had no interest in, that was the fruit of several hours of work for the raider, dropped.  Loot drops are determined by virtual dice rolls, everyone that wants an item rolls, highest roll gets the item. Everyone knew he wanted it, and no one else rolled.  But I fucking did.  Because fuck that guy for doubting me.  When we get outside the dungeon, he's begging to buy it from me.  Right in front of him, I permanently soul bind the mount to myself \"Maybe next month\"  I mount up, and ride away.\n\n\nI my opinion, I am the asshole. I didn't want that mount and never would have rolled for it had he not fucked with me. I didn't need to keep going on this guy,  I had already won.  But I wanted to.  I'm not sorry, I'm fucking proud.  Even now, that day was the only time I used that ugly raptor, but I like to look at it from time to time, and just smile.  Because fuck that guy.",

Okay, maybe they were busy. Fast forward to a week and a half later, I started getting worried and messaged them to start the project. I also opened a Google Doc and shared it with everyone. I wasn't the group leader but I asked them to start doing stuff and no one was responding.

        "title": "WIBTA if I gave my son's unwrapped Christmas gift from his Dad today?",
        "post_body": "Some context. His dad and I are divorced and live in different states. The dad gets him in the summer and some holidays. This christmas my son and I are staying in town, not visiting family. Dad isn't coming up to see him for the holidays.\n\n\nSon's birthday is also in December. All the family (dad's and mine) send him gifts and very rarely is it wrapped. Or even labelled who from. So I've started to wrap gifts and slap names on them. Seemed to me if they really wanted my son to have a specific gift from them, they should include a name or wrap it themselves. I text the dad letting him know what gift he \"got\" for our kid, when he tells me he's not getting him anything. Apparently he told our son he's getting a big gift for christmas instead. I'm a little pissed at that but fine, I put my ex FIL name on that gift. No biggie on that, but poor kid getting nothing from his dad. I at least expected the dad to send a birthday card. Nope, when he said he's getting his son nothing he meant nothing. \n\n\nFew days ago a box came in from my ex. I knew it was nintendo switch and game. So I hid that. Yesterday night my son is telling me all about how he's getting a switch. I'm thinking its hopeful wishing and, not to ruin the surprise, I tell him not to expect everything he wants. Santa doesn't work that way blah blah blah. \n\n\nNope. His dad told him yesterday what it is. What game too. I'm livid. I open the box to check if he at least wrapped it. Nope on that either. Now I'm wrapping just about everyone's gifts to him (from his bday too) and I can't bring myself to wrap a gift he already was told. That's not a surprise. It's not special. And honestly, this kid would love to play with it now. And I don't think the dad even cares about Christmas or gifts at this point.\n\n\nI try to think about our son first, but would I be an asshole for just handing him the Switch and game? He'd be happy playing it now. Not like I'm going to wrap it anyway.\n\n\nEdit: clarification on why I slap names on gifts. Unless I'm told who sent what, it's not my responsibility to track down who sent it. We're all adults, we all have each others numbers or fb. Only a few members decide to tell me what they send, the rest, oh well. My kid unwraps a gift and I make sure everyone has \"given\" a gift. \n\nSo, the gifts I know are coming and from who are labeled correctly. The family knows this. It's been an on going issue for years, for every gift giving holiday. Not my responsibility to track down gift givers.\n\nEdit 2: Even though my son would be happy to have the game now, I'll suck it up and wrap  it. I'll just bury it under all the other presents. So it's last and I can facetime Dad and pass the phone off. I'm still pissed at the ex for ruining a surprise for no reason. Pissed too he couldn't send a damn birthday card. For those about to call me bitter, you weren't there when my son cried because his Dad got him nothing. Hard lesson for a child to learn. So I get my hate and vindictive is coming from that, thank you for the responses and different perspective for me to see.\n\n\nEdit 3: For those arguing about wrapping and how I'm the only who cares, what on Earth are your Christmas' like? This is for my son to enjoy and unwrap. He's a child and presents are fun. I really would be an asshole if I just put boxes under the tree. Labelled to me sometimes, and sender being Wal-Mart. Like theres no names on who from. And what? Hand my child a knife to cut tape? Lol. Nah, wrapping is important part and I really want the family to help out. That 10 mins they could've spent saves me hours. \n\nEdit 4: I'm asshole this community needed, not the one it deserved.",

This year I was tasked with being my Aunt to the party. Now unfortunately she is the WORST backseat driver because if you go over walking speed, she freaks out and starts screaming and yelling at you to slow down.\n\n*For the record, shes perfectly able to drive herself*, but doesnt like to drive anywhere she doesnt know\n\nNeedless to say, I wasn't looking forward to this as it would turn a 2 hour drive into a 3 hour drive.\n\nSo I pick her up, and drive slowly, and save one or two complaints about the weather, its actually a very nice trip, until we get to the motorway/highway.........now in my country, there is a minimum speed limit on the motorway of about 50kph/30mph, this is a **legal requirement** and you can get stopped by the Police for going under it.\n\nSo we get on the motorway and she immediately starts **freaking out**. Shaking, asking me to slow down, blessing herself, screaming when a car goes past etc.\n\nSo to try and keep her happy, I slow down to about 50kph and talk to her, explain that this is as slow as I can go but that shes safe and that we're going to get there safe and sound.\n\nUnfortunately this does nothing and she keeps ordering me to slow down, slow down, SLOW DOWN!! Even slapping me on my arm. At this point, I warned her to keep her hands to herself and just kept driving.\n\nWe continue on for a few more minutes and she keeps telling me to pull over, which you can't do on a motorway outside of an emergency, I ask why and she wont give a reason, so I keep on driving, at which point **she grabs the steering wheel and pulls it** causing me to cut across a lane of traffic and grind against a guard rail, which also tears off my wing mirror.\n\nBy some minor miracle I dont crash and get back in control before coming to a stop, but not before having to physically restrain her to keep her hands off the steering wheel.\n\n\n At this stage, I dont feel safe with her in the car so I pull off the motorway into a service station and kick her out of the car along with her suitcase, after taking photos of some of the damage to the car itself. And off to the party I go, despite her very vocal objections.\n\nNow most of the family are angry at me for leaving her all on her own at the service station, and she has been trying to get me to cover the taxi and hotel fare she had to pay to stay at a local hotel.\n\nSo Reddit, I ask for your Judgment, am I the asshole?",

While there my mother dropped a wrapped gift in my lap and insisted I open it then and there despite previously made plans for me to host Christmas at my new house with everyone. She wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.\n\nThe gift inside was a hideous purple Wal-Mart dress not in my size. The texture of the fabric immediately made me want to scrub my hands. I admit I could have reacted more enthusiastically. I just did not have the energy in me to fake it. \n\nMy mother was obviously upset at my less than ecstatic reaction. She got very flustered and told me I was free to return it but she did not have a receipt for the item and couldn\u2019t I just try to like it?  Couldn\u2019t I just try to appreciate her taste in gifts for once?\n\nThis sounds like making a mountain out of a molehill but this has been a pattern for a long, long time. Previous gifts have included; dollar store jewelry that causes me to break out in a rash (multiple years, multiple conversations on why she never saw me wear it), lipgloss that she had opened and liked, etc. Nearly every time she will take the gifts back for herself under the guise that at least someone (herself) will get use out of it.\n\nIt would be one thing if these things came from an acquaintance that did not know me that well. But my mother has known me for 29 years. She was there growing up as the cheap costume jewelry she insisted I wear kept causing infections in my ears, she was there when as a toddler I would scratch myself bloody over clothing textures, she has never in my entire life seen my voluntary wear makeup.\n\nI put a lot of thought into the gifts I give. I shop through the year, never leaving things to the last minute. I keep a list on my phone of things people in my life mention they like or would buy for themselves if they could justify the spending. \n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t hold other people to the same standards I hold myself to. I know I should have just sucked it up and acted my heart out and quietly donated the dress later. But I could use some perspective and maybe some advice. Reddit, am I the asshole for hating the gifts my mother gives me?\n\nEDIT: Woah, you guys have given me a lot to think about. I do think having a sitdown with my mom (not during an emotionally fraught holiday) in in order.\n\nFor the record, I do not feel entitled to any gifts from anyone. During the lead up to Christmas and birthdays I do convey when prompted that I am \"too old\" for presents, that I don't need more stuff, that I appreciate the thought but please do not buy me things. I tell family and friends I'm happy just to spend the special day with them. That if they feel to hand over a physical gift, I'm happy to take a card (I have a display of them going back 10 years)\n\nI should also note that, no, my mother is not extremely impoverished. She lives well. Not rich, but not hurting for money. \n\nThe rashes I get come from eczema. I should have said fabric rather than texture. \n\nI think after the holidays I'm going to sit down with her and tell her face to face that while I love the heart that goes into the spirit of gift giving, I'd rather she skipped a step and got something to pamper herself. \n\n\n**EDIT TO THE EDIT**\n\nI took my mother out for brunch to apologize and reiterate that I do not need gifts, and that I especially do not need gifts that cause a painful rash. Finally got to the root of the problem:\n\n* According to her, I can't possibly have an reaction to nickel plating or polyester because she touched it and was fine with it and therefore I do not have the genetic component to have that happen\n\n* The reason she keeps pushing jewelry (that reacts with my eczema), makeup (that reacts with my eczema), dresses (in fabrics that react with my eczema) on me is because if I don't embrace my femininity I'm clearly going to turn into a big ol' lesbian. **That's it.**  Mystery solved! If I don't stop going around in jeans and cotton t-shirts in my bare face, unadorned by glittery things, I will never ever be able to snag a man and begin my duty to provide her with grandbabies. The horror! She used the word \"heterophobic\" which I've never heard out loud before and it's just as stupid sounding as you can imagine.\n\nI do admit I lost it driving her home and yelled \"You're still not listening!\" so maybe we're both assholes but I sure know where I got it from.\n\n",

My wife and I recently decided that we want to try and spend more time with our nieces and nephews, and to try to improve their lives if we can. To do this, we decided to build a better relationship with the kids mother. As the full-time caregiver for the kids it makes more sense for us to go to her to schedule time to see the kids, but my brother has been adamant that I get his permission before taking the kids out. He even went as far to say that we should not be doing anything to help the mother of his children in any way.\n\nI fully disagree with his reaction, what I\u2019m doing is for the benefit of the children only. Asking me to get his permission serves only as a way for him to limit any benefit the mother would get from  me spending time with the kids. For example, we are watching the kids today so that she can work an extra shift at her second job. Her picking up an extra shift will be good for the kids, plus instead of being left home alone they can spend the day having fun with my wife and I.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for planning to spend time with my nieces and nephews without asking for my brothers permission?\n\n",

I just finished my bachelors in accounting this month. \n\nInfo that pertains to the story: My old brother missed our wedding due to him getting the reception and ceremony times mixed up. We got married about 45 minutes from where we live. \n\nMy in laws are really awesome people. They are supportive and never guilt us over anything. We take vacations with them for several reasons. They plan vacations 2 years in advance. Most of the time we just have to pay for flights. Which for someone that is paying for their last semesters of school, it\u2019s really helpful.\n\nWe were planning on taking a vacation with my family in January. My parents knew we were trying and told them we would go if we didn\u2019t get pregnant too fast. We got pregnant really fast and couldn\u2019t go.\n\nMy husband and sister had a huge falling out. My sister was 15 at the time &amp; slept over at our house. I went to work at 6 am. They were hanging out. My husband told my sister she needed to put on a bra, because he could see things that made him uncomfortable. She then acted as if he was hitting on her. \n\nI was abused by my step grandpa from a very young age. My husband has been my rock. I can\u2019t count the times he\u2019s gone to therapy with me to help me through everything. I don\u2019t by for a second that my husband hit on my sister. I have 4 other sisters whom I\u2019ve asked if he ever made them uncomfortable, never. I\u2019ve had two really close friends that lived with us. I asked them if he\u2019s even hit on them or made them uncomfortable, never. This caused a huge rift in my family as I sided with my husband.\n\nNow my family acts as if this didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\nOn to the actually story:\n\nMy 18 year old sister (the one who had an issue with my husband) is getting married. In October, on a cruise. We had two trips already planned for this year. First is a family reunion with my husbands family. Again, we only have to pay for flights. Been planned for over two years. My family has a cabin in Alaska. We really wanted to go last year but I couldn\u2019t as I was taking summer school classes. We planned on going this year. My in laws really wanted to go with us. We bring friends so this isn\u2019t an issue. We only have to pay for flights, food to share, and any fishing trips we\u2019d like to do. \n\nMy husband and I both make pretty good money, but we just remodeled our house due to the baby coming. We pay a mortgage and have two car payments. \n\nOn to the cruise, we have to pay for my 9 month old baby to go as a full person. This means we have to put down a deposit of $750 before the 28th of December. We have to pay to fly down to the state of the cruise. We have to pay for a rental car to drive at least another hour. And probably have to pay for a motel for the night. I\u2019m total over $3,000 at least.\n\nI told my parents that I was really nervous draining my savings to put this deposit down for a cruise right before our first child. My dad called and was really upset. He said that we have shunned their family. (We haven\u2019t. We still visit and hang out.) That we only go on vacations with my in laws. That the only reason we were going to Alaska was because my in laws were going. He offered to pay for my baby to go on the cruise, but I already owe them thousands for my car. Which I pay them $500 each month for. I don\u2019t want to have them pay for my baby or owe them more money. They said we needed to drop the thing that happened with my sister (now it\u2019s just a misunderstanding). But it makes my husband uncomfortable. I would be uncomfortable hanging out with someone that accused me of pretty much being a pedophile. \n\nMy step mom text me this morning that I should take my dads offer. That they didn\u2019t think that I would act this way after my brother missed my wedding. (He\u2019s a 25 year old that has no kids that had to drive 45 minutes. I wasn\u2019t even upset with my brother. He was already upset enough at himself)\n\nIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to go, I\u2019m just trying to go what\u2019s best for my family. My husband is upset that my family is guilt tripping me and that they upset me. I\u2019ve been crying most of the day yesterday as I\u2019m a huge tender heart and am very susceptible to guilt. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I\u2019ve had such bad anxiety today and feel terrible. We are having Christmas Eve dinner at their house tonight and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the asshole here. \n\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, I\u2019m 8 months pregnant now. Baby will be 9 months by the time the cruise is here.",

I try to justify this with her and explain its important that we go to bed at the same time, because 1. I have a hard time sleeping if not next to her and 2. It has been expressed that going to bed at different times in a relationship can be detrimental to the relationship itself - it can spiral out of control and become a habit.

My parents raised my sister and they had very different conflicting parenting styles (they are now divorced which seemed to stem from my sister's problems) which essentially resulted in her never getting diciplined for anything ever. The results have been a 7th grader who has about 2 full blown temper tantrums per day, bullies her peers, ignores (literially pretends she doesn't hear) anything she disagrees with, is completely self centered and doesn't try to hide it, and is very materialistic. No one in my family wants to be around her, even my parents. \n\nSome examples of her behavior: she tried to stab me twice growing up, my brother once, and my mom once. She kicks my cat to get to me. She will ask my mom to buy her things everywhere she goes and when my mom says no she will have full blown tempertantrums in the middle of the store. She says that she hates everyone behind their back (my dad's girlfriend, my mom, my boyfriend, my brother) just for attention. She looks under the tree at christmas and sees that she has one less present than the rest of us and then throws a fit because of it, etc. My mom started drinking heavily at least in part because of her, and my dad was borderline emotionally abusive to me to take out his frustration for over three years. \n\nToday we celebrated christmas at my mom's house, and a large chunk was tainted because of her behavior. My boyfriend, brother, and I are all back home from school for the break and wanted to spend time with my mom but she turned it very negative. It's my mom's first christmas after a divorce and she has no one to spend it with, and my sister didn't even care about how selfish she was being. Once we got home I was sitting on the couch with my boyfriend being sad because of how it turned out, and my dad saw me and wanted to get me to talk about it. We talked for a second, just mentioned that my sister was rough today and it kinda sucked. What he said boiled down to \"she just wants to be included and I know it's hard to include her but it's important to understand\" which is true, (I'm not trying to call my dad out for this) that is the reason for her outbursts, but at the same time when she has such bad behavioral issues it feels impossible to be around her at all. This is an assholeish thing to say but honestly I wish I wasn't related to her at all. \n\nI guess the core \"am I the asshole\" is I am away at college all year, and I have the option to spend breaks with my boyfriend's family. I love my family (excluding my sister), but every time I come back I feel awful because I truly can't stand to be around her. I don't want to talk to her. I don't want to text her back when she texts (and I haven't been), I don't want to try to be friendly, I don't want to be the \"good big sister\" anymore.

Don't want her to visit me, don't want her to come to my graduation, don't want her to be in my wedding if I get married, don't want her to be around my kids if I have them.

She is only a 13 year old, still very impressionable, and emotionally stunted. No matter what, your parents are responsible for their own actions. \n\nThat being said, you're definitely NTA, your sister probably needs a lot of professional help, and it's not your responsibility to take her bs.

For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?",

        "comment_body": "YTA\n\nThat was a horrible thing to do and it is eating you up because you did a wrong thing. At this point, telling him what you did doesn't fix the situation. He still made a decision based on your lie.\n\nI was in your situation with my current husband. He was with a girl who didn't treat him well. I was their friend.  I ended up with a huge crush on him.  He often came to me for advice as a friend.  I spent about a year carefully giving him advice to stay in his relationship and work on better communication skills.  I was the one friend who never said an unkind word about his ex because I wanted him to make his own mind up.   I did that because I believe that it isn't ethical to try to break up a couple to get a new relationship going. I think that a relationship founded on such an act probably won't end well. When they broke up naturally I waited a time... asked him out ... and we have had a happy 10 year relationship.\n\nThat said, in my opinion this is your burden to bear now. Telling him is going to fill him with indecision about his prior break up and distrust and pain about your betrayal. If it really was an incident, not a greater indication of your character and suitability as a partner ... him not knowing will spare him pain.  You can be the one to carry it because you did it. I don't believe you are necessarily a crap person or have a bad relationship because you committed one massive ethical crime.\n\nIf it \\*was\\* a greater indication of your character as a partner ... you will blow this relationship up in other ways soon enough, so it won't matter that you did this too."

        "post_body": "This has bothered me for awhile now. So my friend and I decided to go watch the movie Finding Dory and sitting in front of us was a mother, a father and a daughter. The mom was texting so that bright screen was already pretty annoying. Once the movie starts the kid went nuts! She started running up and down the theater pretending to be one of the characters. She was so loud. I even saw her throwing her candy at some of the other movie goers and laughing at them when they asked her to stop. So my friend nicely tells the kids father \u201c Hey, your daughters being kind of loud...\u201d He immediately cut my friend off and said. \u201cWell I guess you didn\u2019t have a decent childhood. Your parents never let you be a kid?\u201d We were left speechless. Then the daughter proceeds to stand up on her chair. She then slips and falls backwards. Thank god I was behind her and she landed on me. She could have cracked her head wide open on one of the seats but I said something that I feel kind of bad about. I looked her in the eyes and said  \u201cYou\u2019re lucky that I was here or else you probably would\u2019ve cracked your head open. You better sit down quietly right now or else I am getting the manager to kick y\u2019all out and you will never find dory if I do that!\u201d The daughter sat quietly in her seat for the rest of the movie, the dad stormed out angrily never returned and the mom never looked up from her phone. After the movie the daughter apologized it was really sweet. Unfortunately though the Mom finally looked up from her phone and said \u201cDon\u2019t apologize to that jerk!\u201d Then her and her daughter left the theater. \n\nSo I ask AITAH for saying such harsh things to a kid? I\u2019m starting to feel like I should have just gotten a manager to begin with. Not to mention the daughter was so sweet in the end. I feel bad. ",

        "post_body": "So. I have an older brother. He is 25. I am 19. He is gay but he is closeted. He has only told me and his close friends about his gayness. Our parents are conservative. He is not my mother\u2019s child, only my father\u2019s. His real mother is a deadbeat. However if he came out I am certain my father would come around to it, only because over the years he\u2019s gradually distanced himself from our old church because of how hateful the pastors\u2019 associates have become toward gay people. It\u2019s not an endorsement of their lifestyle, but it is a refusal to despise them. However he still thinks he has the right to deny baking a cake for them. \n\nI disagree with my father and my parents\u2019 conservativeness, but have yet to vocalize said disagreements. I merely keep a safe distance since I\u2019m in college. My brother however still tries to please them because I think he is conflicted. He still has Christian ideals and prays but his friends don\u2019t share the same values (a lot of them are off the books weed/coke  dealers). He\u2019s a bit of an alcoholic because of the fights he got into with our controlling parents growing up and I wouldn\u2019t call him a deadbeat because he\u2019s a very skilled manager at a retail store and did graduate college buuut all his free time is spent partying and abusing drugs as he tries to support his friends\u2019 rap career (he\u2019s apart of their group and frankly they suck. I wouldn\u2019t disparage them if they didn\u2019t pretend to be better than they are or ridicule me for being book smart, but the only person in their group that has a shot at making it is their producer because he can make beats in the style of many other producers. Lyrically speaking they need some help.)\n\nMy brother is a pretty macho fella. I am not. I do like sports, i play with my friends, but i don\u2019t have as much muscle mass as him despite being toned/muscular myself. He used to bully me because he was treated as the problem child by my parents growing up but that all changed when i played sports in high school. I wouldn\u2019t call him \u201cnice,\u201d but i would say he became invested in my athletic career and gave me helpful pointers, but it was primarily to preserve his reputation at our high school/college. His athletic career was the only way he could gain favor with my dad who served in the military. \n\nAs i mentioned earlier his friends are into drug abuse. He is heavily invested in a thuggish image that he maintains on his private instagram. He used to constantly pick on me for being a square and doing well in high school and college. I don\u2019t resent him as much because I understand where he\u2019s coming from and I\u2019ve secretly been going to therapy for the last year to feel better about myself. I wouldn\u2019t say I am at 100%, but I am far more confident than I used to be. Occasionally though i will be reminded of something he did and it\u2019ll fuck up my whole day. (nitpicking my athletic performance in front of others, calling me gay as a kid cause I was into opera and Sailor Moon, criticizing me in front of our veteran of a dad when i wore brighter colors, belittling my interest in theater, etc.) One day he called me crying while drunk and apologized for being an asshole, but he hasn\u2019t really changed much. He\u2019ll still occasionally call me pansy or queer, despite my protests. I only know about him being gay because he opened up to me while under the influence, and told me \u201cto never mention it again\u201d when he sobered up. One of his friends mentioned it in front of me and he was pissed. \n\nAnyhoo, I attended a Christmas Eve family event and brought two friends. Word got around that I made the honor roll. He scoffed and rolled his eyes. My mother made a smart ass remark at my brothers\u2019 expense. She said she meant it as a joke but it pissed him off. He glared at her and walked out. He returned a couple of hours later and talked to her privately, but he was drunk as fuck. I could tell by his staggering. She urged him to drink some water and sober up and he initially listened but couldn\u2019t resist the call of my cousins playing basketball in the driveway. \n\nHe began to show off in front of my younger cousins. He was sloppy and unnecessarily aggressive. My cousins are 14, 16, and 17. I was already outside with my friends watching and we decided to go to one of their houses. My brother continuously taunted me as I left and threw the basketball at my head. I gave him the bird as I was slowly losing my cool then he continued to taunt me \u201ccone here pussy, come play with me ya little queer\u201d etc etc and I lost it. \u201cYoure the only real queer around here.\u201d He came at me but I ran away and all my friends and cousins subdued him. He cursed me as I got into my car and my dad and all the dudes came outside to find out what happened. He brushed it off and walked away. I haven\u2019t talked to him since and he didn\u2019t show up for Christmas breakfast. \n\nI really hate that I outted him but there\u2019s a part of me that feels good about it. I finally hurt him. But I outted him in front of my cousins who I\u2019m certain relayed the info to my uncle and father. Dads been pretty stern all morning. \n\nAITA? Could there have been a better way to go around this? He just makes me feel so weak and he\u2019s projected his weakness and \u201c\u201deffiminacy\u201d\u201d on to me for so fucking long and it felt good to hurt him back. I just hate that it was at an inconvenient time for him and could mar his already shit relationship with our parents. Being closeted is more-so about survival than anything else and i feel like shit\n\nTLDR; My closeted bully of an older brother got mad at me at Christmas Eve dinner bc my mom showed off my academic success at his expense. He taunted me while playing basketball calling me pansy and queer and I outted him. AITA?",

They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband.

        "post_body": " \n\nLong post. But it needs to be said. Been on my chest for a long long time.    \n  \n\nSolo living for awhile now. For the past 2 years I haven't been giving any money to my parents. Not a single dollar/peso/ringgit whatever. Nothing.    \n  \n\nLast night, my father called me in Viber. Asking why I've stopped giving them money (as he does every once in awhile). He also tells me how he \"wonders\" why giving them 20%(average, he doesnt ask for specifics) of my net income was difficult for me.And for the nth time I tell him that they're dysfunctional. I state his issues one by one, and he finds lame excuses with each one. Right now he is in a desperate situation, for some reason he decided to buy a lot of land which he cannot afford racking up debt no one knows who would pay or how to pay. He is nearning 60 and is tripping everywhere in his shop. My evaluation on his actions at the moment is he is racking up debt for us to pay when he passes away. It's the person that he is and how I understand him to be.    \n  \n\nAbit of backstory how we got into this situation.  \n\n  \n\\* 1st grade = beat me up for protecting a classmate from a bully. Said don't mind other people's business.  \nKept getting beaten up till 4th grade. Would sometimes not go to school cause my lips are busted. My head also has alot of scars since he uses the belt as a knuckle.    \n\\* 3rd grade - made me drop my pants and briefs in the disciplinary office so he can proudly show my bruises to the teachers.    \n\\* 5th grade - I was tired of the bullshit. But I wasn't weak mentally. call me crazy but I knew deep inside I would succeed and leave that shithole. One night he kept shouting 'if you don't like it here leave MY house'. Since our doors were locked with padlocks I asked for the key. When he asked me why, I said I'm leaving. He got really angry that night but never gave me the key.  \n\n\\* 6th grade = Promised a PS2 when I graduate without failures. I graduated without failures, happy for the PS2 but... got beaten up and slapped in public for not taking a photo with the principal on graduation. Hence the source of my 150% conviction that I do not need a photo with anyone (mayor, whoever the fuck) for my success. Succeeding now, without those photos.    \n\\* 1st year high - I was falsely accused by my classmate of stealing her phone. He went to the office... to slap me in public and demanded me to return it. Just because my classmate was the daughter of a business partner. My classmate's brother eventually admitted the it was a prank. Father never bothered to correct the public mistake. Even told stories of how he 'bravely' defended me. Everyone called me a theif (In tagalog, 'magnanakaw'. My nickname would be 'Magna'). Spent 3 years in highschool talking to no one. And I mean NO ONE. Was writing to a notebook all my thoughts talking to myself having imaginary conversations inside my head and writing it down. And since this was my development stage, you can bet your ass I'm totally lacking in social skills. Like bruh I do not know how to build relationships or things like that.    \n\\* 3rd year high - I finally got to clear my name by myself. My being cute helped a lot. Then my bitch mother got my notebook and bitched about it to my father. They're mad since I call them both pieces of shit. And as usual, he tries to play the hero.    \n\\* College - all thru out my mother would berate me. How I'm just an 'IT'(IT wasn't booming then. When I chose my program I didn't know IT would boom. I just chose what I truly wanted) and my sisters (golden childs) are in the medical field.    \n\\* College 1st year. I wanted to get my money from my father. We didn't have allowances, I had to carry books around for rich kids to get mine. What I earned, he said he would keep until I asked for it. Guess what happened when I asked for it? NEVER GOT IT. He then went to my uni and talked to the dean. About how I was about to spend my life savings on shit. Yes he had to make up this sympathetic story about how he was a fucking great father and all. My name just had to be paged on the whole uni. His goal? Just to humiliate me. How do I know? Proudly explained it and even planned to do it to my brother.    \n\\* after 2.5 years working and giving 10,000 pesos to them monthly (50% of salary) I met someone. A girl I really liked and gave me letters and all. Like shit she was the one. So ofcourse I bring her home and all. After a few visits from her I noticed my parent's toxic behavior. They didn't meet her when she came. No food. Nothing. When my mother sees her she acts like she sees a ghost and runs to my father reporting that my so is at the home as if there's an intruder. I knew something was up. Me and my ex made sure we bought our own food, water, utensils when eating in my room. Just so my parents couldn't say we're ungrateful or anything. I talked to my parents and we agreed that if they didn't like her, then just don't be toxic and all.  \n\nOne faithful night when me and my ex came home with takeout food preparing for night shift work from home. my mother started screaming in tagalog. Take note that we are a chinese family. We speak chinese at home with each other. All of a sudden, by magic, she starts screaming in tagalog about the chores, about the dishes, about anything she could scream about. Then slams her fists on my door for no reason. So pretty obvious she wants attention. We ignore her and she escalates. Now I leave my room and confront her. She screams my ex's name and charges her. Since I am over 200 lbs I shove her pretty effortlessly. Whole thing ends when my brother talks ot my mother. Ex decides she needs to leave asap. She hasn't eaten her food bought with her own money. At this point I am fucking pissed. The absence of hospitality. The behavior. The screaming when we agreed that we don't bump each other's way. This was the point I considered my mother dead to me.  \n\nThe epiphany about my father, and his role in all this, also came that night. As my ex was leaving, he immediately blames the whole fiasco on me. About how I started it. How it's my fault. Gaslighting the situation immediately. At this point I realize that the both of them was the source of the family's dysfunction. I immediately stop giving them money and moved out ASAP. Calls started asking for money. How I was ungrateful.  \n\nAfter a year of renting a condo. I decided to resign from work and rest abit. I was about to hop for x3 pay. I was preparing for the interview and all that. Then I overheard by the door my father proudly talking shit about me to my other siblings about how I got no money left which is why I went back home (I was about a million peso in hidden net worth then).  \n\nAnother event while I was reading alot for my programming exam. He comes to my room and asks what I'm doing. I say I'm studying, didn't say what for. He then berates me again that what I'm studying doesn't have a diploma. I let it slide. But i do not forget.  \n\nTechnical video interview comes and it lasts less than 20 minutes and offer was sent with my asking price almost immediately. Now I get paid the highest. Like this is the thickest bundle of money I've ever held 2 inches fucking thick. Eldest sister? Fucking jobless. 2nd eldest sister? Slaving in US, can't save anything. My brother? Almost 7 years in college now. Failed hard.    \n    \n\n\nNow they want my money. NOW THEY WANT MY MONEY. Now they want my fucking money. Mother is telling stories to her sisters about how she's a great mom and all asking for sympathy. My aunts are now messaging me re:forgiveness and all that bullshit. About there's only one mother/father. My uncles on my father side is also saying the same shit. I kept quiet all these years and now that I am succeeding in life they want my money? Now I want to know, with honestly, frankness and zero bullshit... AM I THE ASSHOLE? Am I the asshole for deciding not to support them after all their shit?

        "post_body": "So, to clarify, my sister and i have a fairly complicated relationship. She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank?

She's very sarcastic (which fluctuates between witty and pessimistic), she goes \"out\" far more than I'm used to, and she likes movies but doesn't seem like too much of a nerd.  I don't really know what this would mean for our long term prospects, but honestly I'm just trying to casually date, so that's not at the forefront of my mind.\n\nSo, being a straight up kind of guy and feeling like I can share more with her, I said \"you know, you're not my usual 'type' that I commonly pursue but I'm really enjoying this and looking forward to seeing where it goes\".

Normally (in a relationship) I would just exhaustively talk to my partner to resolve the tension between us, but that's not really an option in the newly dating world.\n\nSo, AITA and should make it up to this girl?

        "post_body": "Here's the long version, you are warned.\n\nMy sister has been diagnosed with DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) and it is speckled with other fun things like psychosis, anxiety, depression, etc. It's a real hoot. Her condition appeared about 10 years ago. It was never fully diagnosed until recently but we had a whole comorbidity diagnosis for a very long time. She is considered untreatable but has a cocktail of meds to treat some of the other issues like anxiety, sleep, depression, etc. At one point she underwent ECT treatments but it caused more pain and memory issues than it did at treating the illness. She now lives independently (which is a BIG step) and she has a very patient and caring boyfriend who doesn't seem to mind her issues and actually serves as the person she feels most comfortable with and will take the most direction from during her episodes. He lives with her and she has been for the most part very happy with her new independent life with him. This came to great relief for most of us because, to be honest, we have all taken a beating emotionally and mentally for years. After a while it becomes exhausting and we all find ourselves dealing with our own mental health issues as a result of our interactions with her. Nonetheless, we love her and try very hard to be supportive.\n\nOut of everyone in the family, myself and my husband and children, we have gone through some major bullshit with her episodes in the past. To the point of where we had to go through trauma therapy with our kids for a specific experience. In the last 10 years we have all been verbally assaulted by her. She has major hallucinations and delusions that make her think horrible things about people and she believes it is real and there is no convincing her otherwise. She has also been a very loving and sweet person who cares dearly about us and those around her. You just never know what person you are dealing with and when.\n\nWe have made great attempts to being understanding and supportive, even in light of past transgression. My husband began to see some correlation recently that indicated she had some control over her actions but was selective of when she wanted to control herself. I did not see this but my husband saw her illness before I did and so I think I am just blind to a lot of it and how she works.\n\nOver the weekend I chose to have her, her boyfriend, my father and his wife all over for a Christmas dinner. It is not our entire family because my sister does not take to that very well and she is recently very close to our father (which she wasn't about a year ago) so I thought that would be the most comfortable for her. I anticipated some stress and issues but was not prepared for what was coming at me. Most of the night was okay. She had some minor disruptions and asked me why I had an attitude. I didn't but it is common for her to imagine things like this and convince herself of such. So our night continued and then came the sudden halt to the evening's festivities.\n\nMy sister, who as far as I know has no interest, care or political leaning, has been apparently immersing herself in TV, specifically FOX news. My father, pro-Trump and proud Republican, immediately begins steering us into the topic of politics for the after dinner chat. I personally don't mind discussing politics because my family is pretty open and non-hating in regards to everyone's politics. My sister however took off in a direction that she made sure I was aware she directed her outrage regarding the topic towards me. My father, Mr. Instigator, knew he fucked up and I don't blame him but I certainly feel like he knew more than me in regards to her politics. \n\nMy sister starts her tear by declaring she was raised \"in little Mexico with THOSE people\". First off, she was raised in a nice suburban to a middle to high income family and went to school with a few Hispanic individuals whom she was friends with growing up. Her entire life is basically the epitome of white privilege. She has never experienced anything, not homelessness, hunger, thirst, cold, or a lack of health insurance. She has had everything her heart desires. She is WELL taken care of and her family supports her even when they sometimes should really walk away. \n\nMy sister, in her moment of declaring herself a victim of Hispanics (which pissed me off), hissed and sneered at me for my support of rapists and murderers. I was shocked because 1) my sister has never expressed racism before 2) my sister would normally feel very protective of people who are victims of bias because she herself is a victim with her mental health problems. I was so pissed because she had the nerve to come into my home, once again, and be a total asshole to me and call me evil and rude, and claimed I had an attitude even before the conversation that erupted into her shit storm. Ultimately she lashed out and then informed everyone she was going home. My dingbat father had her drive them because she was DD since she can't drink at all on her meds. So him and his wife have to go, at least in order to not upset her more or as I was informed direct her rage at them for not coming with her, so the evening comes to its abrupt end.  \n\nUltimately I was hurt and angry. I worked my ass off to make sure the night was perfect. I spent a TON of money on food and presents and tried to make my sister feel at home. I was just done. I have officially had enough of it. I love her and as much as I want to support her I don't think I can because her ability to knock me down has been getting better and better. I have even taken her side when it came to health of my family and I think my priorities just need to be me and my own family. She is happy where she is in life and I am happy where she is as well. My husband really feels she is using her illness as a crutch when it best serves her and I really hope not but I did get that feeling at my house the other night. She purposely attempted to ruin the night and I do think her motivations were something outside of her illness and more in line with the fact that she didn't like that my father and I had something we enjoyed conversing about. She seem annoyed when he would get into a topic with me and we would start going back and forth. She would find the opportunity to cut me off and start almost showing off with her ideas on the topic. I didn't take it personally and actually did think to excuse it because \"she doesn't know better\", but my husband saw it as something else as if she was vying for our father's attention.\n\nIn the end, we ended up continuing the shit storm on text where she laid into me about my non-use of text to have relationship with her and my insistence to call her when she hates talking on the phone. She called me evil and untrustworthy and that because I told her she gave me anxiety that I was somehow stealing her thunder and trying to make my mental health more dire than hers. She said she was done with rude people and my f-ing attitude. My response was snide and I told her that I wasn't the one coming into someone else's house and basically shitting all over them while they cooked me dinner, cleaned up after me and made sure I was safe, healthy, happy, and fed. She deleted me from her only social media account told me to never contact her again. A part of me felt relief. Like I exited the hostage scenario I've been locked inside of for 10 years. I felt a sense of freedom and honestly I felt good about being an asshole back to her and not letting her mental health be the reason I should relent and be all apologies. I know she may never speak to me again, honestly. I know she may very well go into a psychosis and this comes back to haunt us as she devises her weird plot of revenge (she has done that to others). I just want to be separated from it and her now. I also want to hold her accountable instead of just letting her use her crutch for everything when it is obvious she knows better. If she can live independent and be self-efficient, she can also own up to her own bullshit like the rest us. ",

We have been married six years.        \n  \nLast Thursday I got about two hours notice before my ex, who I remained friends with, died. It was really fucking tragic, unexpected, and I was left in the position of telling a lot of people, because he befriended most of my friends the four years we were together, and I was the only one who knew he'd died, so I had to tell at least a dozen friends. It has been difficult.   \n   \nIn honor of my late mom and dad, I decided to put up my first Christmas tree (my mother loved Christmas), and host family gatherings. It was a big deal to me, because it is the first time I've felt ready to celebrate Christmas since my mother died. I invited my bio-dad's side of the family over for Christmas Eve dinner, and planned to have brunch for the remainder of my mother's family. But all my mom's family declined my invite, and my bio-father and brother told me they could only come for lunch on Christmas Eve. I was sad, because it really hit home how many family members have died, when only two wanted to see me for Christmas, and only when convenient for them. I felt lonely.   \n    \nSo I invited all my friends over for brunch on Christmas day. Most of them didn't respond. Only one did, saying she couldn't make it. I thought I'd have a quiet day with my husband, and maybe invite the neighbors over for bagels.    \n   \nWhen I told my husband that no one was coming over on Christmas for bagels, he asked if he could invite some friends. I said \"sure\". He asked me when. I said, \"11a-3p\". We bought supplies to share bagels with a few friends.    \n    \nWe had a nice Christmas morning, and then my SIL and husband's friends arrived at 11. After eating, I watched some Doctor Who with my SIL, and my husband played a 2 player game with his friend. His girlfriend just sort of watched.   \n   \nI was doing okay until 12:30, when a friend who I'd called on Friday to tell him about our friend's death texted me. \"OMG! Did your ex DIE? What happened? My wife just saw memorial stuff for him on Facebook.\" So I had to explain the tragedy of his death again (and I don't even know all the details). I was no longer having fun.   \n   \nI did my best to be a good sport. People kept coming over. I chatted. When I realized I was only talking about my dead friend and it was bumming people out, I moved to the couch and played with my tablet, and chatted with people on discord.    \n    \nI got hungry at some point (3 or 4pm), so I threw the ham we'd bought as an easy meal into the oven, as all of the bagels were gone. While they played games, I cleaned up the kitchen, made cookie dough, and cleaned the kitchen some more.    \n\nI suggested an easy, multiplayer game, and his friend agreed to give it a try, but was a dick about it, and took all the fun from the game.   \n   \nBy 7:30 I was not feeling well, and wanted everyone gone. I had reached the limit of being able to somewhat successfully socialize. I texted my husband, \"I'm not feeling well. Throat is sore. Stomach not feeling so hot. I am probably going to retire to the bedroom, unless everyone is about to leave.\"   \n   \nIn hindsight, I could have been far more direct. \"I wanted this gathering to end at 4. Could you please ask your friends to leave?\" I didn't do this because my husband wanted to get brunch with his friends the other morning, and I asked if he would stay home with me, as I was still reeling from my friend's death, and wanted his company. We determined that I'd resent him if he went, and he'd resent me if he stayed. I asked him to go. He stayed, leaving me feel like an asshole for disrupting his social life with my grief.   \n     \nA little bit more context: due to recent events, I have stopped sleeping in the bedroom, and now sleep in the living room. I did not want to have to go into the bedroom; the living room is my bedroom. He knew that, so I hoped he'd say goodnight to his friends.   \n   \nInstead they started making dinner plans that did not include me. Again, I hoped that he would use that to have everyone leave: they could all go get dinner together. Instead they called in an order, picked it up, and brought it back here. I pulled my husband aside. I told him that I couldn't socialize anymore, and if he was going to continue hanging out with his friends, that I'd go (unhappily) to the bedroom, and would sleep there all night: he could take the couch. \n  \nHe agreed, and I made sure he had everything he needed (pillows, blankets, etc) before I said goodnight  to everyone (it was now 10pm), and barricaded myself in the bedroom. They were loud, so I put on a Netflix show I like to fall asleep to. They were still loud as I fell asleep, around 11:30pm.   \n   \nI woke up angry with my husband for, again, not respecting that my ability to socialize is less when I'm grieving, and ending the gathering at 3, like we initially discussed. I wanted some quiet time in the evening with him, and instead went to bed more alone then ever.  \n    \nAm I the asshole for asking him to miss two social events (one in Oct, and one in Dec) to spend time with me while I grieve, and then asking that he kick his friends out after four hours? For letting my grief effect his social life? I've had a lot of people die this year, so I could see how it could be taxing on him.   \n  \nOr is he an asshole for prioritizing socializing with his friends over being there for me when I ask?

Before we started dating, I made it very clear to her how I was totally against cigs and vapes (lost grandfather to heart condition due to smoking). When we started dating last year, I found out that while she doesn't buy cigs/vapes herself, if she's ever out with her friends then she might use them. I didn't really mind this; I did ask her, however, to tell me if she were ever considering buying a vape or take up smoking because it's something that I wasn't totally comfortable with and we would need to have a conversation about it. She promised me we would if she ever considered it, and that was that.\n\nFast forward to last month, I found a juul charger connected to her laptop. I asked her about it, but she swore it was a charger for some make-up device and that she was borrowing it from a friend anyway. I pressed though, and she admitted that it was a juul charger, and that she had had the juul for 6 months now. When she told me that, I fell silent for a moment then told her that I was going home. She didn't stop me, but as I was driving home I got some texts saying how I was being extremely selfish and that I'm an asshole and have no right to be upset. Tbh, I'm more upset about the fact that she lied to me rather than the actual juul, but I don't know if I'm allowed to be mad at her or not.\n\nI don't want to control her at all, that's not my intention.

This new woman also lost her husband a few months ago. \n\nI ended up uninviting my dad from Thanksgiving dinner after he told me about this new woman because I was so angry, which led to him and my grandparents (dad's parents) hating me. When I uninvited him, I told him that he was disgusting and it was disrespectful to my mom, and that he could spend Thanksgiving dinner alone thinking about how his dead wife would feel knowing he found someone new a month after her death. He ended up spending Thanksgiving with his new girlfriend. \n\nMeanwhile, his daughter (me) is still a complete mess after the death, and I realized he seemed to be doing just fine since he's able to say, \"I love you\" to this new woman and talk about moving in with her at some point soon. I just couldn't stand the thought of looking at him during dinner knowing that he had a new girlfriend. He kept telling me, \"it just happened\", \"give her a chance\", \"it's my life and I can do what I want\", etc. \n\nMy dad was always verbally abusive towards me and my mom, so I've literally spent my whole life walking on eggshells not to upset my dad. My mom always used to protect me from him and keep him in line, since he always called me the worst daughter in the world. We didn't talk for the month between Thanksgiving and a few days before Christmas. Obviously I needed time to cool down. I called him and texted him a few times during that month, but he ignored all of my attempts at contact.\n\nIn that month, I learned that people have a lot of opinions about this subject. Some people say it's way too soon and agree with me and others say that what I did was awful and to just let my dad be happy.\n\nI decided to be the better person and invite him to Christmas Eve dinner, and then he drops it on me that the only way he'll go is if I invite his new girlfriend. I wanted us to all be together since it's the first Christmas without my mom, so I reluctantly agreed. I just sucked it up and pretended to be nice to this woman while my dad kept comparing her to my mom, and then saying he wasn't comparing them when I pointed out that he was.\n\nNow that the holiday's over, I kind of feel like a jerk, but at the same time, he's always been awful to me.

A little background, I have been a hockey player my whole life, and I broke on to my school's varsity hockey team as a freshman, and have started every game since day 1.

I also had a real chance to break the county record of 122, considering I scored 37 goals my sophomore year. It became a running thing with my buddies, and I gained a lot of notoriety for it around the smaller town.

However, in an effort to impress my sister, this guy tackled me as hard as he could in a simple game of touch football. He ended up breaking my wrist, and we had to go to the hospital for it. Doctor tells me I can't play for minimum 8 weeks, considering the physicality of hockey. This takes me to the near end of my senior season.

        "post_body": "I\u2019m currently in a relationship with my Gf of 4 years, and she has a daughter (we\u2019ll call Susie) who is 7 years old, who we share with her Dad every other week. Recently we found out through the new Gf of the dad (through social media, mutual friend who makes shirts) that they had \u201cFamily shirts\u201d done for a Disneyland trip. So we ask Susie, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell us you were going to Disneyland?\u201d out of genuine curiosity. And she looks at us confused has no idea what we\u2019re talking about. \n\nFast forward a month or so, we pick up Susie from school on the beginning of our week, and she\u2019s going on about how much fun she had at her Grandmas house. During a school week. We then found out that the Dad, new GF, and 2 sons, had gone off on a Disneyland trip with out his ACTUAL daughter, during the school week, and couldn\u2019t even let us have her a day early, (but that\u2019s not that important). The 2 sons, are from the new GFs previous relationships, no way related to the Dad. We ask Susie why didn\u2019t they take her too. And she says because then it would be an odd number and not everyone can go on the ride at the same time (or some bull crap excuse like that). \n\nSometime during our week we\u2019re in the car talking about this situation amongst my GF and I. Then Susie shouts, \u201cthey said they\u2019re going to bring me back a gift to make up for it, and they\u2019re going to take me next time\u201d. I then say, \u201cwhether they bring you a gift or not, they still both suck for not taking you\u201d. So then when she goes back on her week, she ends up telling her dad what I said, and honestly. I didn\u2019t give a shit because I meant it. This if screwed up in my book, how do you exclude a little girl from a trip to Freaking DISNEYLAND. \n\nNext time we meet to exchange Susie, the dad walks up to my window and says I better keep my F****** mouth shut and stop telling my daughter bad things about him, and threatens me, and on and on. Granted, this is the first time I\u2019ve ever said anything about the dad, because drama isn\u2019t my thing. So I get out of the car, (because I ain\u2019t no bitch and am size-ably larger than him, just in case if had to hold my own ground, ididnt want to have to defend myself from the seat of my car) and just explained I wasn\u2019t lying, and asked him man to man, in front of his daughter and my Gf, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t Susie go with you guys to Disneyland?\u201d He had a couple of excuses. That it was his new GFs sons first time going, and they wanted it to be about them, not that my GFs daughter couldn\u2019t go, but because she wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it as much as someone who hasn\u2019t been there before. He then also said, because she had already been there with us that she didn\u2019t need to go this time (we had taken my GFs daughter to Disney land, the 3 of us, about 2 years ago). He then keeps going back to how he never talks bad about me (even though they do) and that he\u2019s a good dad and that he doesn\u2019t suck. The exchange never escalated past some mild shouting, and both parties left. \n\nMy GF is annoyed that the situation didn\u2019t need to happen, but does agree what the Dad and New GF did wasn\u2019t okay. So, AITA for being honest in front of the daughter and saying her dad and \u201cstep mom\u201d sucked. \n\nTLDR: Child gets excluded from Disney land family trip (Dad, Step mom, and step moms sons go, but not his biological daughter) I tell her that her Dad and Step mom suck. Dad attempts to confront me in person, but then put him on the spotlight in front of daughter, and explains that they have another trip planned for her in the future. Also says since we\u2019ve already taken her to Disneyland, it\u2019s okay she misses this trip. Dad claims I\u2019m manipulating daughter, but have never said anything about Dad before.

During this time it has been on and off, and our arrangement would always stop when either of us were dating other people or in a serious relationship. The rules were that we were always honest with each other if we were seeing someone else, and we would immediately halt if this were the case. \n\nTo give some context, I have known John since I was a kid, as we are close family friends. However, when this agreement began John was adamant that we must keep it a secret as it could be problematic if our families found out. \n\nAfter I returned from overseas in April this year, we resumed our FWB \u2018relationship\u2019. In June, I became suspicious that John was seeing someone else after a mutual friend made a comment about seeing him out with another girl. I asked him about this, and he said that he had a girlfriend while I was overseas but he had broken up with her before we resumed. I found it a little strange that he did not tell me this, but since we had always been honest with each other in the past I brushed this off (big mistake). \n\nA few weeks ago John messaged me and asked me to come over. As I was at work, I told him that I would message him that night. When I finished my shift, I invited him over to my house. He responded and said that he couldn\u2019t, as he was at Bonnie\u2019s house. When I asked who Bonnie was, he said that she was his girlfriend, and that he thought I knew that. I freaked out and immediately blocked him on Facebook messenger. I now know that this was some kind of weird power play, but I am ultimately still confused as to why he decided to tell me this way.\nAfter he realised that I had blocked him, he texted my phone and asked if I was okay. He apologised, and said that he had \u201csome things to work out\u201d. I asked him how long he had been dating her, and he reluctantly told me that he had been with her since February. Keep in mind that I had also seen his family since then, and no one had ever mentioned that he had a girlfriend, nor did I see any posts on social media of John and Bonnie. I was unaware that this girl existed until this moment.\n\nI felt absolutely disgusting and messaged some of my friends to tell them what had happened. Each of them all said the same thing- that I should tell Bonnie. I was hesitant to do this as I did not want to ruin this poor girl\u2019s life. I slept on it and in the morning I found her on facebook (through mutual friends and thankfully Bonnie isn\u2019t that common of a name where I\u2019m from). I sent her a message request explaining the whole situation, and telling her that I had screenshots if she wanted to see them. She was shocked and told me that her and John were actually planning to celebrate their one year anniversary soon (more surprises) and that he had lied to me about when they started dating (not that it even mattered at this point). \nShe asked for the screenshots and told me that she would break up with him the next day. Despite the horrible situation, she was thankful for me for telling her.\n\nA week later I received a message from John\u2019s best friend, Kane, telling me that what I had done was absolutely disgusting. Although he was angry at John, he said that I was in the wrong for breaking up their relationship. He explained that Bonnie was suicidal and that I had caused her serious harm. He also said that John\u2019s mother (who is my mother\u2019s best friend) did not believe that I didn\u2019t know John had a girlfriend. Kane also said that all the mutual friends he has spoken to think the same thing. Obviously this is untrue, as this whole thing wouldn\u2019t have happened if I knew he had a girlfriend. I had to tell my mother what had happened before she heard it from John\u2019s mother, and now this has caused a rift between the two of them.\n\nI honestly thought that I would want to know if I was being cheated on and that telling Bonnie was the right thing to do. I\u2019m not looking for sympathy at all, but I know that I have told the 100% truth in this situation and I have the evidence to prove it. I don\u2019t doubt that John has told a different version of this story to his friends, however I still feel like absolute trash, despite this being entirely his fault. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling her?

        "post_body": "There's a bit of backstory that has lead me to the decision I made:\n\nI am the supervisor of a team of concierges. Before I worked here, there was another supervisor that worked in my place. A few years ago she lost her mother. She had to go back to Hungary for the funeral. A bunch of clients and residents had donated money but a few co-workers had also lent her some money too (about $1000). They gave it to her with the understanding that she would pay it back. Well months passed and she ended up leaving for a better job opportunity. Since then she's been avoiding calls from the people I work with and has only given them a fraction of what was loaned to her.\n\nNow come to the present time. A co-worker approached me yesterday and told me that his 92 year old grandmother has passed away. He explained that he would like to attend the funeral and be with family in his homeland, India. He was very sad about this. I had consoled to the extent of professionalism but that was all. I do feel bad for anyone who has lost a loved one, but she was 92. I can only feel sadness for someone briefly if they lived a long healthy life. I think if anything, that calls for a celebration.\n\nAnyways, so this guy is telling about the prices to go to India and how outrageous it is. I totally understand the stress of it all but then he asks me for a loan. He wanted about $500 to help him out. I immediately say no. I wasn't rude about it but I made it clear that I don't do that. I don't mind lending money to family and friends who I trust. A co-worker is a completely different story though. I just don't trust him. He may try to pull what the other supervisor did. All of it just seemed fishy. I wasn't interested in getting wrapped up in financial drama. Not to mention, it's two days after Christmas which is always a difficult time for most.\n\nHe was very upset with me for not even considering it. Because I'm the supervisor, I guess they think I make a lot more than them. But it's really not the case. I'm struggling like the rest of the working class.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think anyone should get mad at someone for not lending them money. You have the right to ask someone what ever you want. I just don't think you should expect things from people even during a trying time.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all of your comments. Turns out the guy wasn't even going to India. He asked a few other people and now there is a full blown investigation. I'm not sure if this is grounds for dismissal but at least he learned something from it. Hopefully.",

That's the TL:DR version.\n\nThe longer version is that my niece is going through a biting stage right now and bit my daughter last weekend when they were at my house. They came back for Christmas, and now my daughter remembers that her little cousin bit her and doesn't want to play with her. My wife and I are working with her to get over it and explaining that she's been bitten before and that her cousin didn't mean anything by it, she's just going through a phase and learning that it isn't ok. Understandably, in my opinion, my daughter isn't understanding that yet. Afterall, she's only four. This morning, my mother-in-law asked if she wanted to play with her cousin today, and she said no. As she's said every other day that she's been here since she got bitten. My mother-in-law then said she was going to go home if my daughter couldn't be nice. I got upset by that, but knowing that my wife was on the way home, I just told her about it and decided to let her take care of it when she got here. Then a few minutes later she asked why my daughter wasn't happy. I told her it was probably something to do with the fact that you told her you were going home for, in the four year old's mind, no reason. Then a few minutes later she is asking her more questions about why she doesn't want to play with her cousin and my daughter keeps telling her it's because she doesn't want her to bite her again. My mother-in-law keeps asking like she hopes the answer is going to change and I can tell my daughter is getting frustrated, so I snapped and told her in a not so nice tone of voice that it was because her cousin bit her and she doesn't want it to happen again. Now everybody, including my wife, is pissed at me, and I'm hanging out in the basement doing house work instead of spending time with my family. My wife is upset because she thinks I'm intentionally upsetting her family every time they come over because her sister got upset with me a few weeks ago and said I yelled at her when I answered the same question for the fifth time in a row.\n\nI told my wife I would apologize, but honestly don't feel like I did anything wrong. So, am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I think after considering it for a while that I'm going to agree with the ESH train of thought. And talk to my mother-in-law and wife after the kids are in bed tonight and apologize for how I said things, but make it clear that I support my daughter not wanting to play with her cousin right now 100%. No matter what. And also make it clear that threatening her with what she thinks is the worst thing in the world (mother-in-law leaving), especially to go spend time with the other grandchild, is not acceptable. Wife and I have already had the conversation, and her and her mom have had that part of the conversation already as well. So, I guess it is time to be the bigger person and take care of it. ",

There's about 5 of us and we usually drive around town and hang out on one of the days.

He can sometimes act properly but he's more of a nuisance than anything else. He constantly makes disruptive, loud noises and harasses strangers. Usually he doesn't hang with us and stays home with the rest of the family, but this year his mom/my aunt asks him if he wants to go and says yes. Then one of my other cousins (17) says \"We're going to an escape room and then going bowling, so the music and sounds may be too loud for him.\". My aunt then says that we can spend a few hours with him, drop him off back at the house, and then go out without him. My oldest cousin says he's sorry and that he can't change our plans to accommodate him. Then my aunt goes on this whole rant about how Tristan is just like us and that he just wants to hang out with his cousins for once. But what's funny is that Tristan doesn't really seem to care at all but whenever his mom asks him he unenthusiastically says yes. She says that he's being sincere but I don't buy it.

She is a kind and sweet woman, but she lets her daughter push her around and is not very bright. I have to keep a close eye on her to make sure she\u2019s not creating dangerous situations for my small children. I like her, but it\u2019s difficult to have her here. \n\nLast summer she planned to come out in July (without asking us first) instead of March with my SIL and her husband as well . Turns out this was all the sisters idea. My SIL has never visited us, never met either of my children. Overall is just a terrible person. I can\u2019t stand her because of the way she treats my husband. \n\nSo basically it went like this: \nSIL: We\u2019re coming out for this week in July. \n\nMe: That\u2019s not a good time for us, Husband can\u2019t take time off work that week. I have plans. Let\u2019s look at a different week. \n\nSIL: No that\u2019s all we can do. So we will be there. End of discussion. \n\nSo I changed all my plans. We set up the beds.

No one called him or let him know. We had to tell the kids memaw wasn\u2019t coming to visit after all. It was a disaster. \n\nSo now, my MIL wants to just pretend nothing ever happened and come visit us in March this year. I told my husband no. I said I don\u2019t want her here until she acknowledges how badly she and her daughter hurt his feelings and the feelings of my kids.

The only people that work security here are me and one other person, who I manage.\n\nThe other security guy i used to work with recently got fired. His replacement was an older guy (late 60s) that I'm going to call fred. Fred was extremely incompetent at first, he struggled to understand basic concepts and was very hard to train. I eventually expressed my concerns about fred to my OP manager and they said they would see what they could do.\n\n After about 3 weeks of having this guy work with me, I got a call from another security guy, I'll call him rob, who is pretty good at his job, he tells me that he is losing his job at where he works, and wants to come work with me. At this point, fred was still not doing to well, and I told rob that I'd be glad to have him instead of fred. \n\nEvery week I would get a text from rob asking if I could call him. These calls would be short, but rob would always be asking me questions about things I cant control, like his start date, when to get his uniforms etc ( I dont control this stuff, our branch takes care of this stuff). Every call, I would get a sense of entitlement from rob, he acts like people owe him this job because he has Bill's to pay, and has nowhere else to go. He constantly talks down to me, talking about how I dont know his situation, and acts like he knows everything because hes been working security longer. Every call was like this.\n\nNow that a couple weeks has past, I've been able to work out the kinks with fred, and hes finally doing a pretty good job, no recent screw ups. Today I got a call from rob  stating that he will report in this next Friday, and after a bit of conversation he revealed to me that he would leave if his old boss told him to come back. This would make a headache for me since I would spend a bunch of time training him, for him to leave so that I could just end up training someone else, that could end up being unreliable (hard to find reliable people around here). \n\nFred on the other hand, is and older guy that collects social security, and is very unlikely to leave. Hes not the best, but hes reliable and he doesnt talk down to me. I have to say, I dont really want to kick fred for rob, even if rob might be a little bit better at the job.\n\nWIBTA if I denied Rob the job I initially said he could have?\n\nTLDR; Fred isnt the best but hes reliable and he doesnt talk down to me. I told Rob that he could have this job, but I later learned that he acts very entitled and talks down to me a lot because I'm younger. He may also prove to be unreliable, and may leave later down the road, causing a potentially big headache for me. Fred is very unlikely to leave. Rob is slightly better at the job than Fred is.\n\nFirst time I've ever had to make a decision like this, so any help is appreciated.",

        "post_body": "So my ex and I broke up about 5 months ago. It was a volatile relationship and the last 8 months were long distance. We had some issues between us, there was physical abuse on my part and I feel emotional abuse on her part. I think we were both relieved when it was over. I met someone a week after and we started dating. My ex was not ok with this and we ended up cutting contact completely instead of remaining friends. I was the one that initiated by saying that we shouldn't talk for a bit. Our last conversation she told me that she would tell me if she never wanted to hear from me again, she wouldn't block me, and she wouldn't just simply ghost. She was going to go to therapy to deal with the trauma from the relationship and figure out what she wanted from me first. However, she immediately blocked me from everything on social media. I didn't think much of it, thinking that she was just purging and trying to move on. She got me banned from some local clubs by telling people about the physical abuse, saying she didn't feel comfortable having me around. When my new girlfriend reached out to her saying how having me banned was distressing and how we could all move forward together, she blocked her as well.\n\nAs the months went by, things got more serious with my current girlfriend and I might be leaving the city soon. I wanted her to know that I might be leaving so she could still have a chance to check in with me if she wanted. I just want to be able to help her move on. I also don't know anything about her, I don't know if she's just hiding from me or not, and I am slightly worried about her. I sent her a message on whatsapp and told her that I didn't want to scare or distress her, that I might be leaving the city soon and I am here if she wants to check in. She blocked me. I found out I was blocked everywhere. I sent another message to an old google voice number saying that I would appreciate a check in and she blocked me from there as well. I started to get so worried about her. I drove all the way to her parents house to ask them about her and see if I can help her in any way. Her dad threw me out.\n\nShe then sent a message to my friend, telling him that I had the audacity to show up at her parents house and that if I try to contact her or her family again, she would call the cops. She implied that I was stalking her. I'm not! I was just trying to help her and I was just trying to figure out how to move forward. She promised she wasn't going to ghost and she wouldn't block me and she has. She also promised she would tell me if she never wanted to hear from me again and she didn't. She just sent a message to my friend warning me to never get close. Am I the asshole here??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'm getting a lot of YTA comments right away and I just wanted to say that I thought that this might be one of her emotional abuse tactics, the silent treatment. We were engaged and together for 3 years. I just can't believe she doesn't want to hear from me again. It makes me stomach sink at the thought of never knowing anything about her, especially after all the hurt that we caused each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT2: I've accepted that I'm an asshole. I see now how my actions can be seen as harassment. I didn't mean it like that and I didn't mean to control or scare her. I even prefaced my first message I sent her with \"I don't want to scare you or distress you.\" I'm still having a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that she doesn't want to talk at all. About therapy, I have been in therapy for over a year now, since the last physical abuse incident. I've been working on never doing that again. She still couldn't forgive me after even going to anger management and she treated me like crap. Also, SHE was the one that broke up with ME.",

        "post_body": "TLDR at bottom. \n\n\nFeeling gaslit, hoping I\u2019m not the asshole but I sure feel like one now. \n\nThe father of my kids and I separated 6 months ago. Legal process has not been started yet, but we have been acting separated with joint custody. Kids are 2 and 4 years old. I keep them for 10 days at a time and then he has the kids for that amount of time - this works around his work schedule. We still live together but when my ex is home I spend most days at friends or families homes. \n\nSo on my exes days with the kids now, I am going away to a yoga and meditation retreat for 5 days. He asked if I\u2019ll be Face Timing every day for the kids. I said no. 1, we will be in a rural area with little to no cell service, 2, I\u2019ve reached the data cap on my phone, and 3, I just spent 10 stressful days with them carting them around visiting family for the holidays and I could really use a break.\n\nHe called me an asshole. Then he got his parents involved and they can\u2019t believe how cold hearted I am being and how I have the audacity to go on this retreat in the first place because \u201cwhat do I need to meditate on?, what\u2019s more important than spending time during New Years with my kids and ex?\u201d\n\nEx is demanding I take photos to prove where I\u2019m going, and I refused. His parents got it in his head I\u2019m lying and am probably going to spend a week with a new lover (I don\u2019t have a lover.)\n\n2nd point. We have had a joint credit card for the duration of our relationship. I feel I\u2019m entitled to half of the points on it, and discovered I can use the points to book a very very cheap round trip flight to Europe. I\u2019d have accommodations and food provided the whole time through my girl friends family/friends she has in Europe. I have been wanting to do a girls trip for many years, but have never had the funds and then young kids took my time priority. I\u2019m planning this trip during a time my ex has the kids, and with my own earned money plus credit card points. \n\nMy ex, and his overly involved family, are calling me the asshole. Saying I have my priorities screwed up. Saying how the points aren\u2019t mine, never were. They should be only used to take the kids on a Disneyland trip, which has never been discussed prior. Exes dad says he\u2019s glad my ex is rid of me because I am just a spendthrift with no concern for paying off our debts (mortgage, vehicle, and credit card) and that I need to grow up and get my head out of my ass and realize I can travel when I\u2019m retired and there\u2019s no need to travel in my 20\u2019s - it\u2019s ridiculous and childish and shows I\u2019m an unloving mother. My exes mom says she can\u2019t believe I would do this, and she\u2019s very taken aback and surprised I would even think about a trip when my kids are this age. \n\nMy ex has been blowing up my phone all day with claims of me being a cold hearted bitch who\u2019s just trying to ruin him, and how any cent of money I earn needs to be divided with him and go towards making debt payments. My ex earns about 100k a year, while I have only started making an income after being a stay home mom for 4 years. I sell art online and do commission sewing work. I now make about $4-500 a month which we previously agreed was my spending money for myself, and that this amount would be taken off of alimony payments. \n\nWith having 3 people calling me an asshole over wanting to travel and take a retreat, my head is spinning and I\u2019m feeling gaslighted. Am I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTLDR: I want to take a yoga retreat for New Years, and later in 2019 take a girls trip to Europe that would be extremely affordable with credit card points, and knowing people in Europe who will provide food and lodging. My ex and his family think I\u2019m the asshole for having messed up priorities and claim I\u2019m abandoning my kids (2 and 4 years old) even though my trips fall during time my ex is with the kids. They don\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t want to FaceTime my kids every day during my retreat, and say I should be putting every cent I earn into paying off debt instead of gallivanting across the world pretending to be a single unattached lady. My ex says the credit card points aren\u2019t mine to use because I\u2019ve been unemployed for 4 years so all money spent earning points was his money.  \n\n\nEdit: it seems I am the asshole. And because I chose to have a family and be a stay home mom that means I signed on for my personal life to be over until my kids are 18, and because I\u2019ve not been the breadwinner means I\u2019m entitled to shit all financially. You are all wonderful people, and thanks for showing me what is still wrong with society. A man can pick and choose when he wants to parent, but it\u2019s a woman\u2019s duty to be there 24/7 for her kids and she has no right to choose how to spend money. Great. Just great. You can all go fuck yourselves. You don\u2019t know my full situation and haven\u2019t been under the financial control, verbal and emotional abuse. You haven\u2019t been cheated on repeatedly by someone you loved, who then makes you feel like a shit mom for wanting 5 fucking days away from it all to zen out in the mountains. Meanwhile, to get back at me for taking my retreat my ex has now bought himself an all inclusive vacation package to Mexico in March for 2 weeks  that falls on his days with the kids but he is not taking the kids.

Sure, dedicating yourself to domestic duties is both a valid contribution to the marriage and a sacrifice of your earning potential. This sacrifice of your earning potential is the point of alimony.  It helps you get back on your feet and become your own person again.   However, after a split each party has the responsibility to become self supporting-- especially if they are young, as you are in your 20s-- and so the alimony is temporary and limited.  It's not a lifetime of welfare. \n\nYou are making $4-500 a month doing art sales and sewing.  In effect you are intentionally doing hobby work and not earning to your full potential.  Even if you had absolutely no job skills,you can still work at McDonald's for minimum wage, which at the federal level (many jurisdictions are higher), would be just over $1,150 per month-- over double what you make now.   Worse, it seems that you are the firm believer in what's yours is ours, and what's mine is mine, except for the debts, which are all yours.  \n\nReality check here.  Your marriage is over.  You are soon to be separate people.  You need to start thinking about being self supporting because Alimony isn't guaranteed or forever.   \n\nFrom his perspective, he sees the marriage as over, but he is still having to support you when you won't support yourself.

About 5/6 months into her pregnancy Ellie developed an allergic reaction to her cat Pudding. She and her husband discussed the solutions at length and decided they didn't want to get rid of Pudding altogether, so they asked me to look after him until the baby was born. \n\nI want to be clear here, the deal was I looked after the cat ONLY UNTIL the baby was born. I did this on the condition that Pudding got along well with my own cat, and he did so I took Pudding in. \n\nI adopted Pudding from her, but there was no contract, and no official documentation. Ellie dropped him and his toys off at my house, and I started paying for food and other toys, etc. \n\nThe baby was born months later, healthy and beautiful. However, Ellie and her husband decided that with a newborn they didn't have time to take Pudding back. I'd grown to love him anyway, so I agreed to keep Pudding. At this point, there was no agreed return date for Pudding. As far as I was concerned he was mine now. \n\nIt's now 3 years after the baby was born.

They've never discussed having him back, never shared the cost of raising him, and never specifically come to see him. \nHe has been my cat for three years. I love him as much as I love my other cat. \n\nTherefore, I refused to give Pudding back to Ellie.

So it feels nice to have \"validation\" from other people that i am attractive (or at least worthy of compliments).\nMore info: things are good with my SO. I wish we had more sex but he treats me well and worships the ground under me. I would never cheat on him. Hes the best.\n\nSo am I the asshole for letting men harmlessly flirt with me and not telling them i have a boyfriend until they ask?",

We were introduced some new people, including a newly married couple. \n\nAnyway, after dinner, we were all invited to go hang out at the Married Couples apartment. They had just moved there, and wanted to show off the place.\n\nWhile hanging out, they very nicely offered refreshments, and we sat around while they talked about how they had just used all their savings to move in and buy all brand new furniture, including the rug under my feet.\n\nWell, I looked down, and I just couldn\u2019t help noticing something odd about it. The pattern in the rug was sort of, window/box like. But upon further inspection, it was plain to see. Nazi Swastikas symbols were accidentally all over the pattern. \n\nIt was one of those, once you see it, you can\u2019t unsee it.\n\nIf I had a picture of the rug, I\u2019d have put it on the crappydesign subreddit immediately. But this was a few years ago, and this story just came to mind now.\n\nAnyway, I thought about it for a few minutes whether I should tell them about the pattern in the rug, or just let them live blissfully without ever knowing.\n\nBut deep down I just felt bad, and especially since they were a nice Jewish couple. I\u2019m half Jewish, so I know I\u2019d wanna know.\n\nSo I told them.

As a few of you have pointed out, this does occur naturally sometimes.\n\nBut let me get something straight, whether the symbol, intentional or not, context doesn\u2019t exactly matter. Seeing that symbol, and being educated about it\u2019s true meaning, no matter if it\u2019s Buddhist, accidental, etc, it can still be offensive, because ultimately its most famous usage is linked to one of the most horrific crimes against humanity.\n\nUpdate 2: I can\u2019t believe I need to clarify this, but since a few of you think I\u2019m being serious, when I said they have a secret nazi Rug, I\u2019m not being literal.",

I needed to use the restroom so I went to do that.   \n\n  \n  There was quite a line of people so I decided to act civilized and get in line. The man behind me had a kid (probably like 6 or 7) with him and was getting really upset really fast. While there was about 2 people a head of me a store associate came out and told us he needed a minute to clean the bathroom. Obviously none of use were happy but what are you going to do? The associate goes in the bathroom to clean it up. \n\n  \n  Almost immediately the guy behind me starts complaining very loudly how the worker was probably in there doing nothing and making us wait on purpose. To be fair the associate did take about 10 minutes but the guy was talking loud enough that I think the associate in the bathroom could have heard it fairly clearly. I worked retail so I know how stressed the holidays are on people so I texted my girlfriend telling her it would be a while. I also texted her, \"There is a guy behind me who is acting like a baby about having to wait. He is throwing a little tantrum that is kinda funny.\"     \n \n\n I get out of the text app and start browsing Reddit or something. The guy behind me starts really calling the associate names and generally being an asshole to the young guy who is just doing his job. I turn around and give him a look and he says to me, \"You shut up. I saw what you said about me, asshole.\"   \n \n\n So at this point I'm a little stunned because there must have been an effort to look over my shoulder and see what I was texting. That's kinda a huge violation of privacy in my opinion. I get a little pissed fast and turn to his kid and said, \"Santa Claus is not real. It's your parents. Also the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy are not real. It's all your parents work.\" I walked away at that point because I didn't want a physical altercation to happen or anything.   \n\n\n  Am I the asshole? Maybe what I didn't wasn't proportional but I think it was if you have ever worked retail on the holidays and if I was the associate I would be cheering for me.  \n\n\ntl;dr: Stranger acts like an asshole to retail associate, reads my private text over my shoulder, calls me an asshole for texting that he was being a baby, I tell his kid that Santa isn't real. \n\nEdit 1: Thanks for all the feedback!

I'll get into why.\n\n\nLast weekend, my brother had to do Christmas shopping, so he sent him to stay with me for the night. He had to wrap gifts and his son was always snooping.\n\n I have never babysat him before, or really spend long preriods of time with him. But He was absolutely unruly. I had housework to do and everything and he kept bugging me, about wanting to go out to eat. I tried to fix him something at my house but he made fun of my cooking, he spit it out and fed it to the cat. He screamed at me for 20 minutes to take him out to eat. My son had enough and just begged me to \"Take him to dinner, he's not gonna shut up until he gets what he wants\". \n\n\nSo, i did. I just gave in. But he wouldn't tell me where he wanted to eat at. I drove past all these restaurants, but nothing interested him. So i begged him to tell me where he wanted to eat at, he eventually just blurted out this restaurant that's really expensive, i tried to tell him otherwise and we could go to a McDonald's or something, but he started kicking the floor of my car, screaming that he wanted food from this place. I got him his food, he ordered over 10 dollars worth of crap and when we sit down to eat, he eats about half of it and then complains that he ordered the wrong one. He wanted the spicy flavored food, not the regular. So, he threw another tantrum in the store, and i got it for him. He ate some of that, but threw the rest away.\n\nBefore we left, i bought something for my kids and on the way home. He ate 10 bucks worth of food, and when i look in the backseat, he's done chowed down on the food i bought for my kids too. So, we passed a Gamestop on the way home, and he asked me to stop. I said no and he threw another tantrum, i stood my ground but then he started throwing stuff out the window. I just did it, i had enough. I went to gamestop. But, evidently that was wrong too. He wanted a game called Battlefield, but they didn't have it. He started whining about that, even though there were hundreds of video games in that place, nothing there interested him. So, he threw another tantrum, he fell to the floor and started screaming \"I want battlefield!\"\n\nSo, i went up to the counter and asked \"Please, for the love of God, do you have Battlefield in the back or something?\", they actually did. He got me a copy and i paid for it and we left. On the way out, i bumped into an old friend of mine. I tried talking to them, but he kept pulling my arm, and he even grabbed pebbles off the ground and started throwing them at me.\n\nWe got back in the car and he had annother problem. Apparently i got the wrong version of Battlefield, he threw the game on the floor of my car. At this point i had enough, so i took him back to his father. But when i got there, he wasn't even wrapping anything. He was on the couch in his underwear, drinking a glass of wine. He got mad at me because i brought him back early. \n\nThe first thing the kid did when he got was take out the battlefield game and show it to his dad. \"Hey dad, look what uncle joe got me! Haha!\" and he went in his room. My brother started yelling at me, he said he couldn't have that game because it was too violent.\n\nI tried telling him about the damage his kid had done and he just said \"Oh boys will be boys\", i tried telling him he was an awful parent since his kids that bad.\n\n\nYesterday, he asked me to watch him again. I started shouting \"Hell no! I will never babysit your little demon again!\" I told him he needs to get him checked. Then we had a big argument, he brought up all the things i've done bad as a parent and how my kids turned out.\n\nSeriously, what the hell is wrong with that kid? That is not normal.\n\n\nSo, am i the asshole here? Was i wrong to criticize by brother's parenting and not wanting to deal with his child? ",

I asked him to put his fingers in his mouth, and with his permission I began to push them in, he was gagging, but I continued for a bit shoving them in. This is what guys do to girls, right? You push their head back and forth and it feels good because the gag reflex makes the muscles of their throat tighten. I thought it'd be a funny little experience, because I really didnt mind, I just wanted to show him what it was like.\n\nBut his face was so somber, he looked so guilty, thinking about how that was what he \"put me through\" and I kinda felt bad. He said he\"d never ask me for one again and that wasn't what I wanted at all. My poor baby was scarred.

It wasnt an attempt to show him that I hated it because I dont, and I'm still going to ask to because it's a sex act I enjoy.

        "title": "AITA for canceling a New Year's Eve event?",
        "post_body": "tl;dr: friend of mine made me host her party but didn't involve me in the planning at all. Now she's mad that I cancelled it and didn't let her know earlier.\n\nIn the past few years I (m) have always gone to an event a friend (f) of mine organized on New Year's Eve. She's my best friend and we literally know each other since birth, even if we can't remember.\n\nThis year I asked her again - about a week prior to the event - if there would be the usual party in an old school cellar/shooting range where we meet for drinks and to watch the fireworks at midnight. Only this time she told me that she and her sister wanted to meet up with some friends of theirs. She asked me to come along but also proposed that we should have me as the host for the party since I would always come to theirs and that way it would be fair. Since she was right on that department I accepted and asked who these friends were, if I knew them and how many there would be (the last question is important for later).\n\nFrom that point onward everything went south.\n\n(We live in a rural part of Germany, are in our early twenties and every conversation with her happened per *not-so* instant messenger)\n\nAt first she refused to tell me any details about her friends but I assume she just didn't think it would be a big deal for me. In later texts she revealed to me that I would know only one of them and that the other 3 would be strangers.\n\nOK, cool cool cool cool cool cool cool. I'm always up for meeting new people and having them in my house late at night under heavy alcohol influence while in possession of explosives and all christmas decorations still being up and waiting to be smashed to pieces...\n\nI told her it would be crowded with 7 people, but that we'll make it work somehow. I said I'd do it and she promised me that they are all nice people so what could go wrong (also that part about the christmas decorations will play a crucial role later in the story).\n\nFast forward three days: Haven't heard about any further plans being made or me being involved into anything at all regarding the party *at my place*. I decided to ask what type of drinks I should get and what we would eat. If our moms would make salads or whatever. Just to get back to that topic.\n\n&gt;\"*We'll see. We haven't planned anything yet =)*\"\n\nKeep in mind that it's Wednesday evening at that point and I only had 3 days left to go shopping for groceries.\n\nFast forward another two days: I got sick of her not telling me anything and bought what I thought was generally expected to be there: Soft drinks, potato chips, vodka, J\u00e4germeister, beer and something to mix the vodka with. I messaged her telling her that I bought all this stuff but also that my mom had set up some rules we had to follow, yadayadayada and if she and her friends had decided on what we would eat. She only jokingly mentioned that we could just order pizza and that we would probably starve because it would not arrive. So again, no information given.\n\nShe also told me that we could drive to town later tomorrow to buy everything we need but that I had to wait for her since she was gonna get a new haircut first and it would take three hours (I really don't get how female haircuts work). No biggie, I was going to sleep until noon anyway.\n\nAs I woke up (this noon, as promised) I asked if I could come pick her up at around 4pm to buy everything we needed for the party. She told me that she would need to help her mom cook first and that she would tell me when she was ready. At this point I was sick of her shit. I knew how this would end. I would be ready to go by 4pm and wait for her to text me, only for her to cancel the shopping at around 7pm. No, I wouldn't have that (again) and I told her that I would not wait for two hours for her to finish doing whatever she was going to do. I assume she immediately went into full-conflict mode but managed to calm back down in time. She texted me - in a normal \"tone\" - that it would be best if we both go shopping on our own so we wouldn't have to wait for each other.\n\nWell okay, but please tell me already: What. Are. We. Gonna. Eat?\n\nAbout an hour later she was ready for the coup de gr\u00e2ce and delivered it like it was a normal thing to say:\n\n&gt;\"*Well we rethought everything and don't want to be such a bother to your mom, so we just decided to go to* \\[loud and crowded restaurant\\] *instead.*\"\n\nGreat. Just great. Thanks for thinking about my mom, you're a saint.\n\nMe to her: \"You can't be serious right now. I bought all this stuff and got the house ready for you to cancel everything? What am I going to tell my parents? 'Thanks for setting everything up and buying all that shit but the party is cancelled'??\"\n\nAt that point I was furious. Not only did **she** decide that **I** would host the party, she also didn't involve me into **any** planning at all and then she cancelled it literally two days prior to New Year's Eve?\n\nNow she entered her \"victim mode\".\n\n&gt;\"*But I thought you didn't get anything yet. We would have had to talk about what we needed anyway, so we wouldn't end up having bought too much.*\"\n\nThat was the point where I would have screamed into her face that I had been trying to plan all of this **for a whole week**.\n\nI told her - again - what I had already bought and that nobody here would drink this stuff and it would just go bad. Not a big deal for her problem solving skills though: just mix everything and drink it prior to going to the restaurant. Yea right, we just drink alcohol planned for 7 people for a whole night in 5 Minutes. But wait, it gets better.\n\nMy mom comes in and askes why I'm so enraged. I explain to her the whole situation and she decides to call my friend's mother, since they are also very close. After ten minutes she tells me that my friend's mother had just decided that we would have the party at my place again, but with 8 guests. Remember the christmas decorations, including a whole tree? 7 people would have been crowded already. 9 people would have been three to many.\n\nSo - still furious about the whole situation - I told her that I was done and I would cancel the event and wouldn't come to the restaurant with her and her friends either. There were going to be way to many people of which I would've known only 4, **myself included**, that got invited to a party I didn't want to host and I got literally **zero** information about up until this evening.\n\nAll she replied was that she didn't get why I cancelled it, I **could have told her earlier so she could plan ahead**, that I had *no problem* with 7 people, why 9 would be such a big deal and that I should be more spontaneous and flexible. She also mentioned that I could have invited some friends of mine so that there were more people that I knew but at that point I think she didn't even process what she wrote because again:\n\n7 people are already too many. I told you! Multiple times!!\n\nThen she just told me she was sick of arguing and didn't text back.\n\nI think she doesn't even get the irony behind her last texts. To me it was obvious that she was trying to salvage things because she is used to me doing whatever she want's (**had** a crush on her for a long time) but since I'm over her I won't deal with her shit anymore.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for canceling the party and not coming to the shitty restaurant with her?",

        "post_body": "My wife and I are at odds and can't seem to get on the same page. \nSmall backstory, in effort to be a better communicator, I share last night with her that I'm struggling. I feel that I'm at capacity currently (with life's current events/adulting) and am on edge.\nI feel at times that many things I do are not right in her opinion or just irritate her. Today has been no exception.\n\nStarting at 5:30am, our 1yo wakes and is crying. I get up to help and wife asks that I just try to soothe rather than bring to her for early feeding. I do this, but baby begins to scream again. I thought wife says to bring baby to her and she will feed, but I guess I misheard her. She gets mad and says that I'm messing up the sleep training. I'm hurt by her frustration, but just lay back down.\n\nAnother moment from today: \nFamily is getting dressed and ready to go out for the day. I put on t-shirt I received for Christmas and an old baseball hat. Wife looks at me funny in disapproving way. While in another room, I hear her say in a gameshow voice, \"the whole family gets dressed nice and you decided to wear stupid shirt that says boats &amp; hoes and that awful baseball hat\". I ask if she was planning on taking family pics while out, she says no. I tell her I'll change since she disapproves, and she says don't... I tell her she's being passive aggressive and she says she's just joking and where the hell has my sense of humor gone?\n\nAnother instance: \nI'm speaking with her quietly in bathroom. She says, shhhh! The baby is sleeping. Ok, fine, but I was already taking quietly for that reason.\nA few moments later she shuts a cabinet and it makes a loud squeak and slam. I say shhhh to her as well. She then calls me passive aggressive and says I obviously had an issue with her telling me to be quite earlier, but that she didn't want the baby to wake.\nI agree and say that nobody likes to be shhh'd, but also agree that nobody like to wake the baby even more.\nFrom there the situation spirals and the specific details are blurry, but I'm told that I'm miserable, unhappy, need to figure out what my deal is, to get a life and find my happiness. I have been accused by her multiple times that I must really hate her and the life we have created.\nShe then decides that we need to split for the day, taking the kids out on our planned outings and for \"me to do me\" and figure my shit out.\n\nShe is out with the kids now and I am confused. I know that I am not innocent, as it takes two. And yes, I'm in kind of a funk right now. But it also feels like she is taking shots at me, perhaps out of irritation that I'm not 100% my chipper self. \nFunny thing is, I really believe that the things she accuses me of are some of the shortcomings and character defects that she possesses herself. If I try to communicate that to her, the whole conversation usually gets turned around to how I am guilty of all the things I tried to discuss with her. It feels like a vicious cycle of just going tit for tat over trivial points and arguing for the sake of arguing. And I hate it. It really makes me sad...\n\nNot sure if this is the right forum for this, but the feedback here seems to be good, offering great perspective.\n\nSo am I the asshole here, do I need to pull my head out of my own ass, or is there something else perhaps?",

Try to be more positive when everything in you wants to complain or be frustrated.\n\nIt may sound stupid but if you try to combat the negative thoughts with positive ones they take up less space in your brain.

For context, with the exception of flooring, which is painted, the basement if fully finished, there is nothing wrong with it.  I said NO.  I told my wife how I would be working doubles for the next few days and would need to as much sleep as I can and could not afford to change my routine and achieve the proper amount of sleep. This was unacceptable to my wife and she decided to call me selfish.  Just to clarify, I am a corrections officer, and sleep is the most important thing for me to do my job safely and competently.

        "post_body": "I teach first grade in a very rural, low-economic area.  The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.

        "post_body": "This happened a few years ago but it still plays on my mind a lot. \n\nI got married in a church in the countryside a few years ago. My husband's parents lived in the city and it was a 90 minute drive to the church from their house the morning of the wedding. I was really stressed leading up to it and they come from a different culture where weddings just start when everyone turns up and the time for starting the ceremony isn't as strict. I called my mother in law 3 times before the date of the wedding to discuss the start time and I even had a conversation with her about how the wedding needed to start on time because the priest had another engagement in the afternoon (I'm not sure exactly what it was, could have been anything from a funeral to visiting some parishoners, in any event, the priest was really clear that we couldn't start the wedding late). \n\nI called my mother in law again twice leading up the wedding - I offered her to go to my parents house beforehand and travel with them. I offered her to go to my husbands house and get ready there. I gave her a map showing where the church was. I asked them if they needed me to explain the directions etc. They declined all these things and said they were fine, they didn't need any help etc. I normally wouldn't have done this but I knew it was an area of the country they weren't familiar with and the priest was putting pressure on me about the start time. \n\nAnyway, day of the wedding: I turned up to the church. The church is full. All of my husbands family is there, the bridal party, my family. My mother and father in law aren't there. I'm standing there in front of the church, people just awkwardly looking at me from the pews, and everyone is buzzing around saying \"They're late! No one knows where they are! What are we going to do!\" Everyone is trying to call them but they're not answering. The priest is annoyed at us and saying that we need to start the wedding. \n\nI pushed back the start time again and again and managed to convince the priest to delay the start time by 45 minutes. Forty five minutes pass and I'm still standing around, no sign of them. My husband was freaking out and I said to him \"We probably need to start the wedding soon but they're your parents and you can make the decision whether we wait a bit longer or start.\" He made the decision to start and we got married, his parents turned up just before we had the kiss. \n\nAnyway, people still think it was my fault they missed their son's wedding. His family whisper about it. His parents never once apologised to us. My parents still say it was a \"terrible\" thing that I did. I tend to think it's easier to make it my fault because I'm the daughter in law but this is still a whole thing 3 years later. Had we waited for them to arrive we would have had to wait 90 minutes, we waited 45 before starting. \n\nWas I just being a selfish brat or should we have just kept waiting? ",

She was hospitalized for about 6 days a few months ago after she had what she called a seizure. Doctors did test after test &amp; couldn\u2019t find one thing wrong with her and ended up referring her to a psychiatrist. I think she went maybe once or twice. We went to visit her a week or two after she left the hospital &amp; she was overly dramatic. Crying, rubbing my stomach, saying she would get better to watch the baby. Just over the top. \n\nFast forward, she\u2019s out of work for about 10 weeks and is completely fine being home &amp; not working. The week she goes back to work she has another \u2018seizure\u2019 at her job. They call an ambulance &amp; her husband tells them to cancel it &amp; just takes her home. Seemed like even he feels like she\u2019s exaggerating things. \n\nIt\u2019s been about two months since that &amp; she\u2019s convinced she\u2019s perfectly fine &amp; keeps insisting she\u2019s watching our baby. My husband is on the same page as I am but she has a habit of dismissing everything he tells her. I\u2019m convinced I\u2019m going to have to be the one to put my foot down so will I be the asshole?     \n\n\n****************\n\n\nUPDATE: I tried to keep my initial post pretty short &amp; to the point but I feel like I should elaborate on the whole \u2018seizure\u2019 thing &amp; why myself &amp; quite a lot of other people involved think she\u2019s exaggerating it. Btw, I am NO DOCTOR but even giving her the benefit of the doubt even her actual doctors don\u2019t think it\u2019s seizures. \n\nMy husband is the youngest out of three sons. My husband is definitely the most responsible one, had the same job for ten years, pays all the bills while I stay home, doesn\u2019t ask his parents for handouts or help in anyway, ect. The middle son however, has one child from a previous marriage &amp; one from a current. Both under 10. He works odd jobs, restaurants and things like that until he gets fired. Just got off probation, has no license, and spends all his money on alcohol. He expects my MIL to watch his children whenever he needs for nothing. Sometimes days on end. On top of that his wife, two children, &amp; a child she has from her previous relationship all moved into my MIL\u2019s house. When she had her first episode he was told he needed to move out by my MIL\u2019s brother because he was causing my MIL so much stress. After less than a month he moved back in, this time only with two kids. I guess him &amp; the wife separated. He\u2019s still living there now, rent free, drives my MIL\u2019s car &amp; she\u2019s back to baby sitting.  He\u2019s 27 btw. I know it\u2019s hard to say no to your kids but I also feel like she\u2019s allowing this in her home and allowing it to affect her health. \n\nAs someone who has struggled with anxiety my whole life from medications, to therapists, and even having two panic attacks myself, I know sometimes you can\u2019t deal with it on your own. You have to talk to someone, figure out the problems &amp; find solutions. Multiple people involved think this is what\u2019s wrong with my MIL but shes insistent it\u2019s something worse. To the point where she wants to go to the ER for any little reason. I don\u2019t want to seem harsh but I\u2019m definitely a \u2018if you don\u2019t want to help yourself, no one else is going to be able to help you\u2019 type of person. \n\n**************\n\nClarification: I know it sounds like it but I\u2019m not unsympathetic to my MIL\u2019s health and although some people may think this is a no brainer &amp; an easy decision shes very manipulative when I try to brush her comments off about watching the baby. My husband warned me about her ways when we first got together 4 years ago &amp; she\u2019s shown that side with just about everything. \n\nJust to name a quick few....when we moved into our place which meant him moving out she accused him of picking me over her. \n\nWhen I first found out I was expecting, I had to have a talk about her grabbing my stomach, to the point where she would lift my shirt up IN PUBLIC to see my belly. (One time she even did it when I didn\u2019t have a bra on &amp; I almost had a full on nip slip!)\n\nWe sent her our baby registry before invitations went out for the baby shower because she wanted to start buying, which I am whole heartedly grateful for, but she refuses to buy anything we have picked out. For example, the comforter set, stroller &amp; car seat combo just to name a few. This normally wouldn\u2019t bother me too much but my two girls will be sharing a room for a while &amp; to involve our oldest we let her pick out the room decor to match her existing room so she wouldn\u2019t feel like the baby was taking over. \n\nAll of these things have already been addressed with her.

I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\n[Edit, copied from comment below: I feel like I maybe should clarify that when I said above that I kept swinging because he was a cop, it was his capacity to kill me with his gun that frightened me. I\u2019m certain that I would have responded the same way if it were a open-carrying civilian pinning me.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t me saying, \u201cOh, yes. Now I get to beat up a cop because he threw me around.\u201d\n\nIt was more like, \u201cThis person is a cop and cops have guns and because I hit him unaware that he\u2019s an armed person, there\u2019s a really good chance I\u2019ll get shot.\u201d\n\nSo, like, I made it to where I couldn\u2019t get shot. That probably still makes me the asshole, though.]\n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him. He grabbed me, and I punched him in the head. I was afraid of being shot, so I punched him more and now he has memory problems. Am I the asshole for having continued to hit him? \n",

I called my roommate over to clean a pot that he'd left dirty. Here's vaguely how the exchange went:\n\nMe: Hey, can you clean this pot you used?\n\nHim: But there's food left in it, and I'm saving it for later.\n\n(There wasn't even an eighth of a box of Mac and cheese in the pot, not enough to even justify reheating.)\n\nMe: You left it in the fridge uncovered. It's just going to get gross, please come clean it \n\nAfter some back and forth, he finally got to cleaning it, whining the whole time. I asked if I could get to the sink for like 10 seconds. He'd been complaining about having to actually clean up after himself the whole time, and I was pretty fed up at this point.\n\nHim: Why didn't you wait until you were done to make me come in here and clean this up? You're just getting in my way now.\n\nMe, annoyed at this point: Please. Just shut the fuck up.\n\nHim: Fine, I know you don't want me here anyways, I'm going to leave tomorrow. I'm not going to pay rent and I'm going to move my stuff out tomorrow. I'm going to kill myself, I'm going to leave and jump off the bridge into the river\n\nHe does this whenever something doesn't go his way, no matter how small. This is not an exaggeration.\n\nMe: Either do it, or shut the fuck up. Quit fucking scrounging for sympathy, it's not going to work on me. Fuck off.\n\nI then went to my room. Now, the issue I'm running into, is my friends who watched this exchange are pissed at me, because I 'told someone to kill themselves.' He does this literally every time he's told no, or I ask to be left alone, and I feel like I finally stood up to his threats, and I was met with harsh disapproval from my friends. Am I in the wrong here?\n\nEDIT: More stuff happened. A couple of my friends had some coke, I don't do it personally but to each their own, and the guy in question wanted some, and they said no.

That troubles me, because of multiple reasons. \n\n1. I don't want to be \"the controlling boyfriend\", that is way too over protective, as I sometimes are, nor do I want her to go to the party because of the guests invited and the host.\n\nThe reason of that is firstly: \n- The host is, in my opinion, untrustworthy and have no sense of situation, which I think is troubling when I can't be there to make sure she is okay or be with her at the party.  \n\n- The majority of the male guests has no sense of boundaries and I am worried they will try to make her do a mistake, especially if she is drunk.\n\n2. The girlfriends she is going with are all single and they always drink way too much at parties and therefore, I am worried she will drink too much as well. She has gone to parties without me before, where we were an official couple, without any problems but my anxiety, but this time is different because there are fireworks, alcohol and a lot for people, both good and bad people.\n\n3. I get very easily jealous and insecure about her being with other boys. I try to not control her as I don't think that is healthy but this really troubled me, because I am pretty pessimistic and always thinks the worst is going to happen, which is why I came to the conclusion:\n\nThat, of course, I will let her go to the party, but ask her to not drink any alcohol because I am worried for her and myself. \n\nSo Would I Be The Asshole?\n\nTL;DR:\nGirlfriend is going to a party I can't attend, I worry for her way too much and are asking her not to drink alcohol as I don't feel comfortable with her partying with alcohol, fireworks and a lot of people without me.\n\n\nEdit: \nThank you for the responses.

There are a couple factors at play here as to why we may be having difficulties, so my thought is to rule out as much as possible. She has a bleeding disorder and a family history of ovarian cysts, and I am a bit concerned about whether or not we will even be able to have children. \nYesterday, we found out that for yet another month, we were unsuccessful. In my frustration, I put my hands on my head and she immediately followed with \u201cwhy are you making this about you?\u201d I tried to explain that I was struggling with each month getting our hopes up and that she probably felt the same way. She didn\u2019t want to hear my side and it ended in an argument about how I \u201cmake it about me.\u201d I can understand how I could have put my feelings aside, but in the moment after hearing a \u201cno\u201d again, I was a bit distraught.\nI followed up by suggesting that she go and get a check up. For the last 9 months she has been without insurance (quit her job to pursue a dream of hers, and has no benefits). I recently was able to get her on my benefits, and so this is a possibility. She is making the claim that it is her body, and that it is her decision. I can\u2019t force her to go get checked up. \nHer big Hangup is that doctors typically say that you need to try to conceive for 1 year before bothering them with any concerns of issues with pregnancy. We are at month 6. I suggested that my wife tell a white lie (how will they know when we started anyway?) in order to find out if there are any issues with her bleeding disorder, or cysts. She again reiterated that it isn\u2019t my choice, and that she wanted to wait for a year. \nAgain, I am only hoping to rule out medical concerns for conceiving.

        "post_body": "This has been eating me up inside for a few months now and it was only yesterday, after a family gathering, that I was finally able to articulate what's going on.\n\nMy mum's side of the family has always been close. She's the oldest of 4 siblings, and has 2 sisters and a brother. Myself and my other cousin T are only a year apart, and we're older than all our other little cousins. We're now reaching to our mid to late 20s where we're finally coming into our own and have some disposable income. Since these kids were born I've always wanted to be a good older brother to them... but here comes the challenging part.\n\nAs before, my mother has 2 sisters and a brother. I'm an only child. One sister, D, has a daughter and a son.\n\nHer brother, J, has 3 kids, who are now entering their teenage years. These kids are honestly lovely and I enjoy spending time with them, and would like to get to know them a little better. They're all developing fantastic personalities and I love playing games with them and generally introducing them to new stuff (new movies, board games, etc).\n\nAnother sister, G, has two daughters, one of whom is quite severely disabled (let's call her D1). We're talking non-verbal communication (so basic sign language) and an inability to understand what's going on around her. Her younger sister is also disabled but less severely, and importantly, she listens to instructions and behaves, for the most part (let's call her D2).\n\nThe issue comes when we try and include D1 in activities. When the kids were younger (4-5), this wasn't much of an issue since they were all enjoying the same sort of activities... but now that they're all teenagers, it's clear it's becoming a lot more difficult to accommodate for D1/D2. Watching movies becomes challenging as their attention span simply won't care for it, and playing games becomes difficult too. As the only adult in the room, you're instantly responsible for their wellbeing and it's rough when they don't listen. Instructions like, \"D1, don't blow up that balloon\", or \"D1, don't pinch D2, that's not nice - D2, move away from D1\" are _completely_ ignored.\n\nThe issue here is that I want to spend time with J's three kids, but since our family is quite tightly knit, I'm worried that me spending with them will invite criticism from D1/D2's parents. I want to take them to the movies, or play some games with them and talk to them like adults and just foster a caring relationship with them, but I honestly don't want to do it if I'm expected to nurse two other children that are difficult to parent.\n\nPart of me feels like a huge asshole for it since it's obviously not the kids' faults they were born with heavy intellectual disabilities, but as the other 3 kids mature into adults, the gap between all of them is just going to get wider.",

        "post_body": "I've been kinda seeing this girl lately, I'm 27M and she's 21F, and for the most part things have been going fine, although there is still a little bit of immaturity on her side.  Anyways, I was driving her back to her house and cutting through some back roads and we see some people walking up the street.  I live in the Northeast and it's very cold outside right now.  She sees them and gets this huge smile on her face and tells me to \"watch this.\"  She starts rolling her window down and starts opening up her water bottle.  At this point I'm pretty sure she's going to douse them with water in frigid temperatures.  I tell her not to do it, but as we drive by them she flings the water out of her water bottle all over them and laughs and gives me the biggest shit eating grin.\n\nI was fucking pissed, because I'm pretty sure what she just did could be considered assault and if they got my liscense plate I could be liable.  So I pulled over about 100 yards past her victims (they could still see us) and told her to get the fuck out of my car.  She looked at me shocked like she did nothing wrong and refused.  I reached across and opened the car door, and then unbuckled her seatbelt and told her to get the fuck out of my car again.  Again she wouldn't and told me to just drive her home.  So I pushed her out of the car, drove forward a little bit so she couldn't scramble back in, and tossed her purse out a little further up.  And then I drove off and left her on the side of the road.\n\nObviously she blew up my phone calling me an asshole, and its needless to say that whatever this relationship was it's over at this point.  I dont think I was out of line, but she did only have a sweatshirt which is not the best in freezing weather.  She claimed she had to run away because the people she flung water at started coming at her.  And I know she's broke ass, so it's not like she could call an Uber or Lyft, she would have had to get a friend or family give her a ride if she could find someone (she had her phone), otherwise it was probably a 6-7 mile walk home.\n\nI dont feel bad for kicking her out of my car, what has me doubting myself is the conditions I left her in (potentially violent situation, no heavy winter clothing, and broke).  AITA?\n\nEDIT:  I totally understand why people are saying I'm an asshole as well, and I'll take that.  If I can just add one little bit to defend myself though it's this.  Me kicking her out wasn't a premeditated move, I was angry that she put me in a potentially bad situation and that she was so disrespectful of some random people and of me.  I wasn't thinking of what she was wearing, or how broke she was when I kicked her out.  I also wasn't considering that a violent situation could arise, I was actually thinking that it would serve more as a shaming tactic to kick her out in front the other people.  I didn't think anything potentially violent could come of it.  I just wanted to add that, I was angry, and very well might be an asshole.  I'm not a psychopath.\n\nEDIT2, the Captain Hindsight edit:  So I'm going to make a couple of clarifications based on some of the comments I've seen pop up, and then I'll give you what I would do in hindsight.\n\n1.  I said the weather was below freezing, I should have been specific.  I'm not talking -6\u00b0F, it was just below freezing around 30\u00b0F.\n2. I didn't kick her out with a t-shirt and shorts on.  She was wearing jeans, a couple of layers of clothing, and a hoodie.  She wasn't wearing a heavy winter jacket, but I didn't kick her out naked and afraid.\n3. Prior to her throwing the water out of the window, the people walking on the street were walking in the opposite direction I was driving.  When I was driving away after kicking her out, it looked like they were still walking in the same direction in my rear view.  I even looked before I went around a bend and lost line of sight on her and it still looked like they were walking in the opposite direction (and she wouldn't need to walk that way, she would be walking the same way I was driving).  I mentioned that she claimed they started coming after her, which they very well may have after I left, but I didn't see that.  If it looked like violence would have been brought down upon her, I would have picked her back up.  I'm not a monster.  Also, to those of you saying she could have been murdered or kidnapped, lets be real.\n4. Again, I should have clarified this before but I live in a very safe and populated residential area.  It was 6-7 miles back to her house, but only about 1-1.5 miles to a main road with public businesses and she knows the area very well.  Like I said before, she had jeans, layered tops, and a hoodie.  She was not going to freeze to death.\n\nAll that being said, I appreciate everyone's input and it seems like most of the comments seem to be a mix of ESH and NTA.  Some of them definitely raised some good points, what I did was definitely dumb because it could have been potentially criminal (although I'm not sure about what the laws are in my state about removing someone from your vehicle).  And I agree with what a lot of people said about dropping her off at some kind of business somewhere else.  If I could do it again, I'd probably bring her to a gas station and ask her to go get me a drink from inside while I pump gas, and then ditch her there.  That being said, like I clarified in this edit, she wasn't going to die from exposure.  I do disagree with the people saying that I should have driven back to the people and made her apologize.  For one, I'm not her father.  I'm not going to make her apologize like an eight year old that took another child's toy.  Second, they could have potentially damaged my car.",

We're currently 7 members, but we decided we'll be opening applications in January to fill up two spots in the group, so that we'd be a group of 9. Everyone currently in the group is a girl, and and our youngest member is 13 while our oldest is 20 years old. This all happened yesterday, except for a few little things.\n\nWe made the initial announcement about applications opening maybe a month and a half ago, only stating a few basic requirements for applying, such as knowing how to sew your costumes. A few people immediately messaged us, stating their interest in joining the group. After a while, we decided with the group to implement a few new conditions we hadn't stated in our initial post, such as an age limit (15-24 years) as well as that we'd only be accepting girls to join the group. The reason for making these limitations is that we'll be having sleepovers and training camps with the group, and having a man there, especially someone several years older than any of us others, would make the majority of our current members, myself included, feel uncomfortable in part due to previous bad experiences with men in similar situations.\n\nOne of the people initially interested in applying is a 23 year old trans guy. After the new conditions were posted, he again messaged us to ask whether the condition \"You identify as a girl.\" means you have to actually identify as female, or if it's okay to be a trans guy but still cosplay girls for you to qualify for our group. What I replied with was that for the sake of our members feeling safe and comfortable, we'd like to limit the group to just girls. I also said no one in the group has anything against him as a person, and we hope he doesn't take it like that.\n\nFast forward a few hours, and he's done a little bit of very vague posting to his instagram story about not fitting in so making yourself fit in somewhere else, while his girlfriend posted a few longer paragraphs to her story about how you shouldn't judge anyone or discriminate based on gender. She made it sound like we'd been rude and discriminatory against this guy because he's a man. Some things she said were that if this was a work situation something like this could be taken to court, that she thinks everyone should have equal chances to things regardless of gender, that it's stupid to say someone is a bad person just because they're a man, etc. Today she posted more about it, stating how it's unfair to leave someone out of something because of their gender especially when they're a sweet and lovely person, and that something like this can crush someone's dreams.\n\nNo one in our group said he's a bad person just because he's a man. We didn't respond to any of the posts. Our leader put up a post on our group account's story saying we apologise to anyone cut out by our criteria, and that we'd love to have everyone in the group, but because of sleepovers or training camps it doesn't matter if it's one or more people who feel uncomfortable, and as such we decided to stick as an all-girls group. We explained the reasons behind all the conditions in our post where we stated them, and have tried to be as nice as possible to everyone when responding to comments and direct messages.\n\nNote that I, and many of our other members, are part of the LGBTQ+ community ourselves and have nothing against trans people. Trans or cis, you have the right to choose which gender you feel is you.\n\nI have screenshots of the messages and story posts if anyone wants to see them, but they're all in Finnish so I don't know if they're much help.\n\nTl;dr: My all-girls dance group and I wouldn't like to let a trans man who is a few years older than the rest of us join the group because the majority of our members feel uncomfortable working so closely with and having sleepovers and training camps with a man.\n\nAre we the assholes for not letting him join even though he would have liked to?

The doctor told us there's a 75% chance our baby will present the disease with 50% being moderate and a 25% chance the baby will present the severe form. The doctor also explained that if he carries the moderate and severe Thalassemia he will need transfusions twice a month for the rest of his life and he will eventually need transplants. We freaked out, my husband started telling me we should interrupt my pregnancy right now that he's little (9 weeks), that we should just stop trying and adopt instead. We cannot not if the baby has the disease until he is a few weeks older and here in Mexico City abortion is legal up to 12 weeks so my husband is desperate. But I don't want to interrupt my pregnancy, I have always wanted to be a mother, I love him and I want to meet him and take care of him if it is needed, I don't care if he's sick, I just want my baby. My husband doesn't get it, I have no one to talk about this besides him, nobody knows I'm pregnant except us. He is upset with me, he says I'm being selfish, that bring a sick person into this world doesn't make sense and that if it turns out the baby has the severe disease he will never forget himself because he would be the main cause and he will never forget me because I want to have him. We argued last night and we both cried, I love my husband so much, but I love my baby too. \n\nI can tell my husband is really hurt, and he's making me feel like an asshole. Am I one? Am I being a selfish bitch? Is it better to just interrupt the pregnancy? I haven't slept at all. I want my baby to be healthy and I can't stop thinking there's a little chance he will have a mild form of the anemia. I'm not against abortion but I want to have him. I don't know where else to post this... \n",

I really don\u2019t want to be providing alcohol to a minor, especially a high school student, in the apartment that my fianc\u00e9e and I, both professionals, reside. It could impact our careers. I feel somewhat hypocritical for that, since I did drink underage frequently, but I just don\u2019t want to put myself in that situation.

Cue my mom and I waking up to the kid going TO TOWN on his entertainment center touchscreen, and I peek over between the seats to see him smashing his finger into the screen for god knows what. Now, in my mind, we\u2019ve politely requested him to stop twice before and the fact that I got woke up because of his \u201cactivity\u201d, I get pretty pissed off.

My mom immediately looks back at me and hisses my name, telling me that I shouldn\u2019t have done that, it\u2019s bad manners, etc. It worked, since he didn\u2019t bother my mom the rest of the flight.

So uh, here it is.\n\nYesterday I got an email notification from Netflix stating that they were glad I was back, and a confirmation of a phone number change. I had only signed up for the 1 free month, and deactivated it after. I instantly knew something was up, especially because I had been sleeping the previous 14 hours. \n\nI got up almost immediately and logged into Netflix. I got the person's number and called it myself. A lady answered and immediately after she said \"hello\" I said \"Hi, can you explain why your number is now associated with my Netflix account?\" I heard her shuffle to hang up, and when I tried to call back, it went straight to voicemail. At this point, I figured there was no way this was some scammer putting in a fake number. I called Netflix, explained the situation, and they cancelled it and logged out my account on all devices. I changed my account password/phone number and they refunded my money.\n\nYou see, dear reader, if that was all, I wouldn't be posting here.\n\nSo I called again, and left an angry voicemail along the lines of \"nice try bitch.\" I proceeded to figure out everything about this man- his name, home address, and a confirmation of his phone number. I called from my bfs phone, and the lady picked up and didn't speak more English than \"hello?\" and \"what?\" After trying to interrogate her, a man with a very thick accent said \"Stop fuckin' callin' me.\" and hung up immediately. Alright, fine. I'll stop calling you.\n\nI proceeded to sign him up for as many wake up call sites as I could, with times ranging from 5 minutes away, to 4 in the morning. I sent his number to as many of my friends as possible, encouraging them all to call him. The final call by a friend was placed at midnight, in which he answered, \"What the FUCK do you want?\" I was finally satisfied... Or so I thought.\n\nI'm still filled with ideas on how to abuse this guy. Next time anyone asks for a phone number for ANYTHING, I'm putting his in. A friend suggested putting him on casual encounters on Craigslist, but I think that's illegal, so I'm not gonna do that. I have all his information I need to do literally anything. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation? Should I just let it go? Do you have any suggestions on how I can make this guys life even worse? Many thanks.\n\nRE-EDIT: \n\nY'all really like the word \"psycho,\" huh? Jeez though, this got bigger than I thought.

I've harassed them with calls, so now I am being the harassed. The hunter has become the hunted. Gdi.\n\nFINAL EDIT: \n\nThis got a lot bigger than I ever expected. Thanks for the free karma I guess? This is probably what you've been waiting to hear the whole time though;\n\nI know I am the asshole. I don't feel bad about it, but I'm not going any further with this guys information.

Me and my mom both are are working and evenly split the bills which is working fine, my younger sister is still attending school and she has always been kinda the troublemaker in our family, my relationship with her was good but my sis and my mom don't get along at all in the recent time ( actually for a year), it escalated in the recent time and unfortunately this wasn't just for a stupid reason, it is something big.\n\nMy mom got together with her new BF and they're in a relationship for about 6-7 months, they've done everything together but my mom never was ready to introduce him to us, we respected that and waited for when the right time comes.\nCouple days ago I've seen my younger sister and mom's new bf in the city together, when I questioned her for what reason they've met she lied to me that he just wanted to know the family better but he didn't want to meet me yet, eventually ( I'm really trying to cut to the case) I confronted her about it and told her that I will tell our mom, She wanted me to keep it a secret at all costs, so she told me everything that happened. \n\n- My sister got in contact with the guy because according to her she loves him, she insisted on meeting him and during their first meeting she tried to get intimate with him which she eventually succeded in. They kissed and had oral sex but my sis swears that they didn't do more than that, I, as bad as it is, told my mum about it in the morning today, she is absolutely devastated and broken to say the least, she doesn't know how to process at all.\n\nWhen I finished explaining everything, my mom started crying and ran out, after that my sister came out of her room ( also crying) and repeatedly tried to justify what she did, I was so angry that I slapped her to the face.\nMy sister then spit me in the face and returned to her room. Since then we don't talk.\n\nI feel so guilty for doing it and I don't know how I should talk to someone instead of you guys here, this whole situation is tearing our family apart and I have no means to stop it.\nI first and foremost have to look after my mother, she's absolutely broken and needs the most help but apart from that I don't know what to do, on top of all that this incident made it even worse.\n\nAt the very least I managed to get this off my chest.....\n\nUPDATE 3: \nI've just wanted to tell you guys that you were right, I didn't have any right to slap her, for that I apologised to her this morning. She doesn't accept it nor does she want to talk to me again, I made her an offer that we both could meet a professional, to find a solution for this mess or at least try to find one, She refused and that was it.",

All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was also is 16 has a tinder account and keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. (Edit: we had the presentation the same day as the party not the day after it)\n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this?

But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents.

        "post_body": "My current situation is somewhat complex, so apologies in advance for the long read.  \nThe background story, as succinctly as I can manage, is as follows, with a tl;dr at the very bottom of the story (prior to my AITA questions):\n\nMy wife and I were expecting our baby daughter to come in late January, but she was too excited to meet us I guess, as she decided to come early in late October.  Our premature princess was born at \\~28 weeks, and went straight into the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where she currently still is.  \n\nThe delivery process itself wasn't smooth either, as we were trying to stall the progression while the corticosteroid injection helped baby's lungs to mature more before delivery, and we opted for a C-section as the ObGyn suggested this was the less risky option for the baby to be delivered safely without complications.  Unfortunately, my wife's epidural chose the C-section time to stop working, and she had to be put under general anesthesia, which meant she was unconscious and I wasn't allowed to be in the OR when our daughter was born.  \n\nMy wife also said afterwards that although she couldn't move and didn't feel pain, she was actually aware ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia\\_awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia_awareness)) during the procedure and could hear the conversations being had.  We also had another unfortunate complication in that her post-op recovery wasn't normal, as one of her legs temporarily lost function and wasn't able to move as well as the other after the surgery.  This required a one-week hospital stay to gradually gain enough function back that she could mobilize safely on her own, then another 4 weeks-ish before she was back to \\~90% normal function, and only in the last 2 weeks has she been more or less independent in movement with enough endurance to be able to drive herself to the hospital to visit our daughter in NICU.  Prior to this, she would have to wait until I was off work before we would go together to the hospital. \n\nOther relevant background info is relating to my work situation.  Being a family doctor, I have a relatively stable/flexible occupation in my workplaces.  The clinics have patients who do rely on me for their well-being, but no one is critically ill, and I have colleagues who could cover me in a pinch, or the patients can have patience (my usual line when I'm running behind during the workday), and wait until I was back at work later on.  I also teach medical school students in small-group sessions, so have scheduled teaching sessions where they would have to find a back-up tutor if I cancel on short notice, or they would need to reschedule those students.  Lastly, the aesthetics clinics I work at definitely have clients who expect I be there on their scheduled appointment availabilities, otherwise they might just go elsewhere for their Botox/filler needs, and not come back to the clinic again.  I'm extremely unlikely to be fired from any of these jobs for taking a certain amount of time off on short notice, but the longer I take off, the greater the impact on the job itself as well as others relying on me being present.\n\nCurrently, our daughter has progressed reasonably well in NICU, with only a few minor hiccups/obstacles here and there, but is otherwise healthy and on track for a late January discharge, which we are very thankful for.  Needless to say, the last 2 months have been the most stressful time of my life, which is saying a lot given my occupation/training.  Despite the hecticness, I haven't missed a day seeing our daughter in the NICU, and on most days spend at least 3 hours there, and up to 6-7 hours on the days where I don't have work.  The NICU nurses are excellent and provide 24/7 care (makes me extra appreciative to have the Canadian healthcare system, otherwise I'd be close to bankrupt by now probably), which means that when we go, we help out with some tasks like diaper changes and feeding, to build some normalcy in the situation, but even if we aren't there these tasks are done by the nurses.\n\nOne of the additional difficulties with this kind of situation is that being at the NICU means I have less time outside of work hours to complete tasks, which includes completing patient charts/records in a timely fashion, completing invoices for the aesthetics clinic owners that I work on a revenue split for (I'm now 3 months behind, meaning I haven't been paid for that work yet, technically), buying/assembling furniture and other baby needs to get ready for baby's arrival back home, etc.  There's a host of other things that also need to be done, including an ethics/legal complaint related to the hospital stay, and other complex shit that happened while my wife was in hospital, but all that would likely be another Reddit post later when I have time for it.  Additionally, due to the stress of everything, recreation time that usually helps me cope with stress also comes at a premium.\n\n  \n**TL;DR -** Premature daughter in neonatal ICU following C-section 3 months before anticipated, with maternal complications including intraoperative anesthesia awareness and leg neuropathy requiring \\~1.5 months for functional recovery.  Daily visits to NICU means less time for other responsibilities, including work-related and life-related tasks, as well as impact on stress coping recreational activities.  Occupation as a family doctor means job stability/flexibility, but impact on others if I'm not at work.  \n\n\n**AITA questions**:\n\n1) My wife was frustrated with me for returning to work earlier than she wanted me to.  I took 95% of the week off during the time she was in hospital, spending essentially the entire day to be in hospital with her to aid in her mobility/ambulation/activities of daily living, and slept on the pull-out couch in her room every night.  I went to 1 teaching session that kept me off-site for \\~4 hours, as it was too short notice to reschedule easily.  The week after my wife was discharged and at home with an easier time completing daily functions, I went back to work at \\~75% capacity in the 1st week after discharge, and then back to full-time by the 2nd week after discharge.  \n\n**AITA** for going back to work at this pace, given the circumstances?  Finances aren't an issue with savings, but the opportunity cost is also high for not going to work.\n\n\n2) My wife feels that I don't want to spend as much time at the NICU as she does with our daughter, and puts pressure/guilt on me for this.  I admit that I have a different perspective than she does on the situation, in that I know even if we're not there, our daughter is safe and cared for by the NICU nurses.  As such, I do want to go every day to see our daughter and bond, but at this stage, it doesn't make sense for us to spend 8+ hours there, basically doing most of the NICU nurses jobs for them.  My wife tried this initially as soon as she was able to get to the hospital on her own, and it exhausted her physically/mentally, to the point that I had to convince her she needed to scale back to the 3-4 hours we had usually been spending there.  I recognize that caring for a child IS a 24/7 job, which will be about a 70/30 split on responsibilities when our daughter comes home, since my wife will be at home with mat leave from her job as well as taking the semester off from her school program, while I continue to go to work.  However, the situation is still different slightly, as whenever babies nap, that's time that the parents are supposed to nap/complete chores/tasks, which in our situation isn't the case since we're at the NICU, not at home.  \n\n**AITA** for wanting to just go to the NICU for a few hours a day, so that the rest of the available time can be spent catching up on everything else in life that needs to be done before our daughter comes home, thus freeing more time to spend bonding with her once she is back?\n\n\n3) My wife is also frustrated at me for taking more recreational time/opportunities that she thinks is needed, given the circumstances.  At the end of a workday, I did feel the desire to unwind a bit, either by watching something, browsing Reddit of course, or gaming.  Yes, I know I could not do this, but I'm not sure how my stress levels would be if I didn't.  I also am relatively social, and would hang out with friends once or twice a week on average (used to be 4-5 times a week when I used to be single).  We would usually just play card/board games and grab a bite, and I wouldn't ever get drunk or anything.  Since the birth, I've only gone out 2-3 times to hang for a few hours with them on weekends, certainly less than I did before (luckily they know and understand the situation)\n\n**AITA** for including de-stressing recreation time as part of the schedule, which does delay some of the other tasks, and how much is appropriate?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for the read, apologies again for the long post, and grateful for the honest opinions to give me some perspective.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: formatting for easier readability.",

The reason you\u2019re TA is for this right here.\n\n&gt;I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019re willing to throw away 15 years of friendship because you\u2019re butthurt you weren\u2019t invited to be in the wedding party is petty and is an asshole move. **Her wedding isn\u2019t about you**, and just because she was in your wedding doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s obligated to put you in hers, nor does it mean she doesn\u2019t value your friendship. Going nuclear over it only shows that a) you\u2019re BSC/narcissistic and b) she was right to not ask you to be there. \n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to go to anyone\u2019s wedding you don\u2019t want to, but throwing a hissy fit  and throwing away a long friendship because you didn\u2019t get what you thought you were entitled to is an asshole move.
