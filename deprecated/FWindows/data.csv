AITA for refusing to give my parking spot to a disabled woman?,"I live in an apartment building that comes with 1 spot in a parking garage. My spot is the one closest to the elevator. 2 weeks ago the apartment manager came to talk to me and asked if I would be willing to give up my spot since a disabled woman was moving in. I said sure – I would be happy to switch spaces. He said I misunderstood – he was asking me to give up a space in the garage entirely. He explained she used a van with a powered ramp – that she would need 2 spaces to be able to use it. I told him I would not give up my space. I pointed out to him that the parking spot was part of my lease.

Last week I came home and there was a large van with disabled plates parked next to my spot. I pulled in, parking as far from it as I could. The next day I get a call from a woman about 7:30am – she said that she was the owner of the van needed me to move my car. I wasn’t happy – I had still been asleep, but I went down to move my car. She did the same thing the next 3 days. The next morning (a Saturday) she called me at 5:30am – and I told her she had to be kidding. I went down and told her that I don’t wake up normally until 8:30am and I would appreciate it if she didn’t call before then. She told me that she had plans and not to be a jackass. I reminded her that I was doing her a favor by coming down.

That evening (5:30pm) when I got home the van was parked partially in my space so that I couldn’t use it. I had her number so I called. When she picked up she said something snarky like “isn’t it annoying to have to wait on someone.” I told her the difference was I could have her towed and if she wasn’t down here in 5 minutes I would. She told me I wouldn’t dare and hung up on me. I waited the 5 minutes and called the tow company. It took the company about 30 minutes to get there and tow the car from my space. She never came down.

She calls at 6:30pm. I picked up and she started screaming. I just hung up on her. She called back, still screaming. I hung up again. About 30 minutes later I get a knock on the door and she and the apartment manager is there. She asked me what hell I was thinking having her van towed. I told her that is what I am supposed to do if my space is blocked and I did warn her first. The apartment manager said we needed to come to a compromise. I said that I did not need to compromise. According to my lease I am entitled to a parking spot. I never agreed to be woken up early every day and I certainly ever agreed to give up my spot entirely. She said that she was promised a spot she could use. What was she supposed to do? I told her that she needed to work that out with him (pointing at apt mgr) and leave me out of it. I am done running every time she calls. She called me an asshole as they left.

I feel bad. There aren’t any extra spots. It’s one per apartment.  This isn’t her fault, but it isn’t mine either. AITA for not making more of an effort to help?

EDIT:

Info I should have put in to begin with.  There are no additional spaces.  It is one space per apartment in the building - with no extras.  The way the garage is laid out I don't see a way to give her extra space without removing one of the spaces.  

The apartment manager has offered to reduce my rent if I give up my spot entirely.  I refused. I live in an area of town that has truly awful parking.  I am paying about 30% more for my apartment than a similar one in the same area because I want the parking space. I will not give up my space. ",Not the A-hole
"AITA for not agreeing to be used to ""keep things calm"" while my boyfriend's daughter studies?","Me (37f), boyfriend (42m), his daughter (13f). We've been dating for 4.5 years.

&#x200B;

I live a 20 minute car ride away. His daughter is studying for a big text this week and tends to get antsy. My boyfriend is helping her. I went over on Friday and Saturday to cook dinner, and basically sit there reading while they are studying. My boyfriend says my presence is calming to them. Cool.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I stayed at home doing my own stuff. Today I helped my aunt clean her house and get groceries. When I got home tonight, my boyfriend requested that I come over to just sit there and hang out because his daughter is having trouble focusing etc.

&#x200B;

I don't feel like it. I'm tired, and I just don't feel like going back to my car and driving 20 minutes over there to sit there reading while they study. I had every intent of going over tomorrow morning and spending the day -- tonight I want to relax with a bath and a glass of wine.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend is very angry with me and thinks I'm being selfish and unfair for not coming over.

&#x200B;

I honestly don't buy that I'm this ""calming presence"" and I personally don't see why they NEED me there while they are both busy.

WIBTA if i start putting vaseline on the front door of my apartment?,"so my apartment unit is on the first floor of my building, which is the same floor that the parking garage and main stairwell are on. the door to that main stairwell is next door to my unit - and while they are the same color, they do not look alike in any other way. my unit door has the apartment number, a welcome mat, doorbell, and a REGULAR doorknob, while the entry to the stairwell is one of those push bars, and is literally located in the middle of the pathway from the garage. 

the problem i’ve been running into is that people try to open MY door in place of the stairwell several times a week. i’ve already added some additional bolt/lock measures just in case it’s not as harmless as i assume, but even my maintenance guy laughingly said he had mistaken my door before and that he’d seen other people in the complex do it too. while i understand that people might be able to make this mistake once while distracted or on their phone or whatever, SEVERAL times a week i hear someone literally shoulder multiple times into our door, rattle the knob, or push against the bolts and it scares the shit out of me. it’s an awful sound at night and literally makes it seem that people are trying to enter our home (which they are...)

i’ve become increasingly frustrated that people haven’t learned to double check which door they’re opening (even though this shouldn’t really be difficult to mistake) and i told my boyfriend i wanted to put vaseline on the knob after locking up at night, and while he thinks this would be well-deserved, he is scared of someone getting upset or retaliating against us or our cars, etc. while i can understand how it might be upsetting, i think it’s a relatively harmless approach. i’m still compelled to see if this is a good deterrent, as it’s our doorknob... and i think it would be difficult to defend without admitting you tried to open our door. but anyways, would i be the asshole here?

TLDR: people mistake my unit door for the main stairwell door even though they don’t look alike, i’m compelled to butter our knob to try and deter people from trying to open it

edit: thanks for all the responses, i wasn’t expecting to get so many opinions, haha. i’ve calmed down and walked myself off the vaseline ledge, i’ve already had things on the door before and was really looking for something to deter people without them having to look (considering they ignore all the other tell signs...) i have a meeting with the landlord tomorrow and will bring up appropriately identifying/labeling the stairwell, and i’ll look into some real signs to indicate a private residence (though i’m leaning most towards the sock on the doorknob)

edit #2: well this got way more traction overnight. i submitted a formal maintenance request to add appropriate signage to the door, or even possibly to paint it a different color, and the manager has already responded that he’ll get an exit sign posted on the stairwell. i’ve also got some baby-proof doorknob covers on the way. i think the door wreaths are kind of tacky, but i guess i’ll use that as a final resort if this doesn’t work. thanks for all the suggestions! these are all much more practical approaches... lmao",Asshole
AITA for asking my friend to stop talking about her abortion?,"I'm going to start off by saying: I'm 100% pro-choice and always will be. And, yes, I had an oopsie baby this pandemic. I know that probably makes me TA, but my husband and I are giving her a great home and love her more than anything.

My best friend, Judy, has been very involved in this pregnancy from the beginning--brainstorming names with me, constantly asking me about it, etc. 

The issue is, Judy had an abortion a few years ago. The would-be father wanted her to abort it and so did her family, so she did. She regretted it immediately after, and I consoled her through the whole thing. I was on call around the clock, and she used to come over my house at 2 am and I'd let her cry it out.

Throughout my pregnancy, she started talking about her abortion. Any time I would talk about being excited, she'd start talking about her abortion and the whole mood would change. I would avoid talking about pregnancy with her, but she's the one who always opens up the conversation. Even when we were brainstorming names, she wanted me to name the baby after what she was planning to name her baby.

When our baby was in the NICU, I told her, and she told me she hoped my baby didn't end up like hers...I know she was trying to make me feel better, but it's just such a different situation and it felt so inappropriate. My nerves were already frayed and I just told her to stop talking about her abortion and hung up. She hasn't responded to any of my apology texts or calls since. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking my friend to stop the way she shows off her “before” shots when she’s refashioning my clothes?,"I am a plus sized gal who is really into fashion. I usually donate my clothes unless I can resell them. My friend Katie is really into “refashioning” clothes from thrift stores. She buys plus sized clothes and then alters them into her size with a lot of other changes, like making them into crop tops or mini skirts or things. It’s a really popular creative thing to do.

Well she asked me if she could have first pick of my clothes because I’m actually larger than what she usually finds, and it’ll give her more material to work with. I said sure and would let her pick through my stuff I didn’t want, but asked her to tag me in her posts and point people to my shop where I sell the “nicer” things.

She started showing off her refashion stuff on Instagram and I was excited… until I saw the way she did it.

In Katie’s before shots she makes these really exaggerated grossed out faces where she’s draped in the oversized clothes. Or she’ll do that face where she blows out her cheeks and holds the clothes out as wide as she can and does a cross-eyed expression. It’s really obvious to the viewer that she’s trying to “mimic” a really overweight person… like me.

When I saw that, my stomach dropped and I just couldn’t shake the bad feeling it gave me. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and asked her why she was making those expressions in the before shots, and she said she just thought it was funny.

I told her that to be honest, it felt hurtful, as I’m the one who gave her the clothes and it looks like she’s just straight up making fun of me and my body, especially since she tags me.

She told me that I’m being hypersensitive. I asked her to please just not make those faces. She told me something like “After you give me the clothes they aren’t yours anymore, so you aren’t really in the position to tell me what to do.”

I thought about that for a while and in the end I did agree, if I give her the clothes they’re hers to do whatever she wants with. So my solution is that I’m just not going to give her anymore of my clothes. I told her that and she blew up on me, telling me that I’m just looking for a reason to be offended and if I’m this insecure, I should be working on bettering myself.

AITA for asking her to stop what she was doing in the first place, since I'd given her the clothes?

**I just wanted to thank everyone for the responses. I didn't expect this to blow up.** I want to reiterate that I don't think her refashioning plus sized clothes is the issue. A lot of people do it and it's great to use items before they just end up in the landfill. Plus for everyone saying she should just go buy fabric like everyone else, good apparel fabric is so expensive in comparison to what you can find at the thrift shop. ",Not the A-hole
AITA for charging my husband for taking care of his dog?,"I (39F) have been married to my husband (40M) for two years. I came into this relationship with my old girl, Mimi (16F), my wonderful dog. My husband had never had a dog before we started dating/got married, but he fell in love with Mimi and recently wanted one of his own. 

I was firmly against this anytime soon. Honestly, Mimi doesn't have long left, a year, maybe two tops. She's starting to go, and a puppy would make the last of her time too stressful. I insisted that, after she passed and we mourned, we could get a second dog. My husband wasn't happy, but he agreed. 

Well. Christmas comes around, and guess what. My husband brings home a puppy. I was furious, to say the least, and demanded he take it back to the breeder. I work from home and he goes into the office, so I'm the one who would be taking care of it. He refused to take it back, so I said the only way he could keep it was if he paid me. He agreed, though I don't think he believed me. 

I researched how much dog care would be, drew up a contract, and put it in front of him to sign. He did without reading it. It's been a month, and my monthly bill has been sent to him. He's blown up, even though the dog is only alive because of me after a miserable month. I told him he can pay or take the dog back. We're at a stalemate here. 

I outright own the house, so we have a shared bank account for utilities, groceries, etc. Everything else we earn we keep for ourselves for our own savings and fun money. I'm charging him $400 a month, since that's what boarding is around here.

Edit: Oh, wow. This has blown up. I will admit, it's a bit petty. 

To address Mimi, I've turned my office into a doggy daycare sort of thing. The puppy stays in the office with me in a playpen with a water bowl and some toys, and I take her out to pee every hour and a half, as well as give her cuddles and enrichment throughout the day. Mimi has free range of the rest of the house, and spends most of her day sleeping peacefully on the couch. They only have to interact during walks. 

So, I promise, Mimi is very much not stressed out. Only I am.",Not the A-hole
AITA for getting upset when my mom thanked god instead of me?,"Okay so I am not really religious but my parents are. Last night I was got an email from a college I applied to. It's my dream school and is really hard to get into. So me and my mom opened the email together and I GOT IN!! (I still can't believe it). After we realized that I was accepted I like screamed and was like omg or whatever, but my mom went on to ""thanking the lord"" for my admission and saying things like ""the lords work is good"", ""thank you god for getting my daughter into college"". And I guess that's okay but like i didn't get an acknowledgement for the work I did, she just thanked god. So I was like ""I was the one who took the SATs, wrote the essays and studied all these years, you would think I get some credit"". I was instantly called disrespectful and got in trouble she was saying I was disrespecting the religion.

AITA for not wanting to scoop cat litter for my pregnant wife,"My wife and I have a split of chores that works well for us. She loves cats, and I love her being happy. I'm maybe less enthusiastic about cats than she'd prefer. One of the tasks in her column is to scoop the 3 litter boxes for our 3 indoor cats. Life has been good.

Well, now she's pregnant and she's read that toxoplasmosis is a thing, and she shouldn't change cat litter. I've looked into this, and just washing your hands after changing cat litter is all you need to do. I think the whole ""I can't scoop litter for months"" argument is a bit much. It seems like the standard advice of ""pregnant women shouldn't scoop litter"" is way overblown, but nobody ever tries to limit statements about things that could result in pregnancy issues.

To quote Wikipedia: ""Numerous studies have shown living in a household with a cat is not a significant risk factor for infection, though living with several kittens has some significance."" I get being super extra careful, but this seems overboard in our house. I don't like to scoop litter, and I don't like helping to encourage living in fear of things that are really unlikely to occur.

**Full disclosure**: I'm not actually an asshole, I value a good relationship, and I'm not going to die on a hill of cat litter, so I'm scooping the damn boxes. I'm just bitter.

Edit: This was actually a lighthearted topic with us. If anyone sees this in the future, I beg you, please don't buy a Litter Robot. They break way too often for something you pay so much for. You end up having a Litter Robot and extra backup litter boxes.

Edit 2: I don't know how public health succeeded so amazingly well at creating concern of initial T. gondii infections from adult indoor cats, and yet 25% of people don't want to wear masks indoors  to slow the spread of COVID. I blame Warren Buffett.

Edit 3: To those of you who say she should divorce me, I agree. I don't think she should've married me in the first place. She has a history of making bad decisions. ",Asshole
AITA For reporting my therapist after she disclosed information to my stepmom?,"
I (20f) lost my mom in 2018 in a car accident. It was sudden it was devastating and I had no one to turn to for support. My dad married my stepmom a year later. I currently live with them preparing for medical school. I have to say I'm not that excited to start because I have a lot of unresolved grief and needed to talk. My stepmom has been trying to insert herself as a replacement for my mom mad it's very obvious. She's controlling and gets involved in every single aspect of my life it makes me uncomfortable. I told my dad that I'll be seeing a therapist my stepmom said she'd take care of it. I have been in therapy for two months now. However lately I noticed my stepmom wanting to talk to me about things that I regularly bring up in therapy to my therapist. She'd bluntly ask questions about things I said in therapy she at some point offered me money to talk to her. I stopped talking to her. But she started brining up my mom during dinner It's not easy to talk about my mom. It's very stressful and causes me to get emotional. When I asked how she knew she admitted that the therapist told her. I was shocked. She went on about why I shouldn't hate her and respect her more and ""get rid"" of the negativity and just accept and try to adapt to this new normal. I had no response but I was mad I yelled at her and told her she had no right to police my words and get involved in personal manners. My dad said I shouldn't yell because my stepmom was just worried about me and wanted to make sure I was making progress in therapy. I left the kitchen. I decided to stop seeing my therapist the next day I told her about what my stepmom said and told her that I'll be reporting her for breaking confidentiality.

My stepmom threw a fit and my dad told me to back down and that I was free to stop going but not cause issues and mess with people's careers and act out like that.

"AITA for knowingly letting my son go bankrupt, and refusing to help?","In a predicament with my morals. Perhaps you can help. 

The story:

My son has started a string of unsuccessful businesses, two of which I have funded for him (money isn’t an issue for me, due to success selling a large software company ten years ago).

Each time I have assisted in bailing him out. However, the last time, I told him it would be my last - and that I’d rather he asked me for some business advice and mentorship rather than my money.

He started up another company in June of 2020, focusing on a growing sector of the technology industry, but he also ran this business into the ground and refused my mentorship. 

As expected, he also wanted me to bail him out. This time to the tune of $1.2M owed to creditors. I have the money, but it’s the principal behind it. 

I held firm on my “no”.  He told me he’d need to file for bankruptcy and I said “so be it”.

His personal bankruptcy filing had just completed today, and I admit I perhaps wasn’t fully aware of the scope of destruction he would see. 

His family have lost their home and moved into a trailer, lost their cars, many belongings and he also lost a painting his late mother crafted which is worth around $250,000. 

Basically, he is ruined - and will be for many years due to the credit hit he will take. 

Tonight I learned from his wife that he’s gone for emergency counselling due to everything he has lost. 

I am stuck in guilt over whether I should have bailed him out this time, or stuck with my decision to say no - and knowingly allow my son to dive bomb into ruin for the sake of a few hard life lessons. 

Was I the asshole for not bailing him out? 

TL;DR - I refused to bail my son out of a business loss, knowing he would be forced to file for personal bankruptcy and ruin his life.",Not the A-hole
AITA For refusing to change my sons pull ups?,"My ex and I have a son who just turned seven. He still wets the bed and as such still wears pull ups. I always thought we could do more to prevent the bed wetting, (restrict fluids, get him one of those alarms, etc) but she thinks he'll grow out of it. Her entire family has a history of wetting the bed late into their teens and claims nothing worked for her, which I respect. 

What I don't like, however, is that she insists on cleaning him up every morning. I understood doing it when he was little, but he can clean himself just find now. He goes to the bathroom fine, on the occasions he has day accidents he cleans himself up (at my place anyway, I think my ex does it for him back at hers) and he even showers fine. I don't see the point in us doing it when he can do it himself. 

She says it's because he won't get changed in the mornings, but when he's here I refuse to change him. He either changes himself or he sits in a wet pull up. He generally changes himself, but these last few times he's refused, and I've sorted this by telling him to shower (and as such, forcing him to get changed). Ex is angry, saying it's wrong of me, and I should just change him in the mornings because it's one little thing. 

I think he's playing her. I don't believe all his day time accidents are real accidents, either, (he tends to have many many more at hers than he does mine) but she just insulted me further for even suggesting it. 

I tried to recommend getting him help, because it's quite odd to me that he continuously wets himself and has his mother change him when there's two perfectly fine toilets around. Still, I was called cruel, and family friends think I should just drop it. AITA?

I just have one little niggle. He frequently is ill with coughs, colds, migraines etc and obviously he’s out of action for that, which is fine, he’s ill. So, I then do 100% of the child raising and housework. And with 2 toddlers in lockdown is quite a lot. But when he’s ill he turns into the most pathetic baby I’ve ever met and it drives me up the wall. He’s been in bed for 5 days and he text me saying he needed help, I thought maybe he’d been sick or shit himself or something so I went in to see what was wrong and he asked me just to google his symptoms. A cold. He has a cold. I’m more than happy to make an bring him meals, drinks, medicine, cold cloths whatever but I really don’t have the time or the emotional capacity to baby him. Like dude google your own cold. 
And today he called me upstairs to request I cut up his dinner. Yes. A grown man wants me to cut up his dinner for him. I asked him to repeat it several times and before I left the room. 
So I went down stairs, cut up his dinner, put it in a plastic kids bowl and gave him plastic kids cutlery and gave it to him like that. 
When I gave it to him he said ‘what’s this’

I said if he was gonna act like a baby I’d treat him like a baby. I have enough going on and while I’m more than happy to meet his needs I can’t mother him or pander to his every whim. He’s more than capable of cutting up his own damn good imo. 
What do you reckon? Was that an AH move? Or just a little petty like I intended.

Edit - he’s had a negative coronavirus result. 

Edit - I speak to him after every time he’s ill that while I will meet his basic needs whilst he’s sick, I have 2 little people that I have to meet their every needs. He agrees with me everytime that he’s dramatic when he’s ill but pulls the same thing the next time 🤷🏼‍♀️",Not the A-hole

AITA for resenting my mom,"My (f16) mom was a SAHM until I was in 4th grade when she got a job as a teaching assistant.

It was great at first and she seemed happier but around a month later she started tutoring after school, on breaks, and on weekends all day and I couldn’t be in the house when she was tutoring because it was too distracting for the kids so I started going to my grandparents house during the day. 

My mom went from being room mom and making dessert for class parties and driving on field trips to never taking a day off or canceling a tutoring session for anything. My grandparents drove me to school/picked me up, and took me to all my softball practices and games and took care of me when I was sick and took me to all my doctor/dentist/orthodontist appointments. I would go home to sleep and that’s it. 

My parents would leave on weekends to “take a break” so I slept at my grandparents house on weekends. My grandpa started driving on field trips and my grandma cooked for every class party (my classes all got used to Arabic food because of her). 

The only time my mom ever took a day off work was when her brother died 2 years ago. She refused to take me to the funeral because she “couldn’t deal with me”. 

Now I’m in my junior year and my mom and I don’t talk. I don’t think she even knows how old I am. My grandparents and I are very close because they’re the ones that raised me since 4th grade. 

I came home one night and my mom started yelling at me for never talking to her and complaining that we aren’t close anymore. I yelled back that it’s because she abandoned me when I was 9 and always cared more about her job than me and went back to my grandparents house.

AITA for saying “except I’m not a child”,"So for some context I am a very petite person. I weight 103 ib at my heaviest, am 5’ tall and while I have curvy measurements I wear a XS on average and even those are pretty baggy on me at best. I joke about my size all of the time because I’ve accepted that I’m just a very small person. Some people take it a bit to far and like to grab my waist or make snide comments about gaining weight and such “not being a problem” or needing to “eat more” to which I just tell them I am active and have health issues that keep me thin. 

Today a customer and I were joking about me having just as many issues finding clothes as he did because he was a bigger guy, to which his wife decided to reply “then just shop in the kids department, you have no right to complain! You’re just bragging and no one cares”. Her husband looked embarrassed and got quiet. She had been snide and rude with me the entire time and I had enough so I asked her “I’m sorry, do I look like a child?

I've talked in it asking for them not to go to a specific place as I really want to go and we have agreed to hold that place off until next year but my husband said they should all go to this other place. I reminded my husband that he couldnt go this year.

This sparked a fight between hubby and I where he said I wouldnt be pregnant anymore so theres no reason to miss. I told him we will have a few week old baby at the time, that I needed him home. He threw a fit saying he has never missed a year and he wasnt going to start when I could have my mom come help me. I called him an ass and told him he wasnt going this year. We ended the arguement in a ""we will see"".

I'm now getting shit from his family and 1 of his friends saying I cant tell him he cant go and that I'm being a needy bitch. Two of his friends are with me on this saying he needs to step up because this wont be the only thing he will miss being a parent. AITA",Not the A-hole
"AITA for directly calling out a woman’s snobbish behavior, causing several people to leave our knitting group?"," So one thing I can’t stand is snobby people who act like the only way to do things is their way. It’s a huge thing in crafting groups. People act high and mighty because of how they learned, the yarn they use, knitting being better than crocheting, etc etc. 

I hated the energy in a lot of existing groups, so I started my own. We switched to virtual stuff since Covid started, and I have rules that you have to agree to follow before you can join. One of the rules is to be kind to others, and absolutely NO “snob” behavior.

Everything has been going great, except this pre-existing group of friends joined, and they really push the boundaries of the aforementioned rule. They started dipping their toe with comments about acrylic yarn and how they would NEVER use it, with dramatic “icky!” faces. 

Well, they did this again when a new girl joined the group. She was using an acrylic yarn in her project, one of the women asked her what she was using, and then the little clique acted like they weren’t directly remarking while obviously doing it? (This is kind of hard to explain but if you’ve EVER had to deal with mean girls, you know what I’m talking about)

It was like “I just don’t understand how people are STILL using acrylic yarn these days, I mean there are SO many other options… unless you’re still shopping at big box stores instead of indies.”

In the middle of that rant I was just like ‘Hey guys, let’s remember that we’re not here to judge anyone for what they’re using or how they’re using it, okay?”

Well this pissed off the group, because they started arguing with me about how “Nobody was judging anyone” and “Oh so I can’t even have an opinion now?” and “Why are you trying to censor us? We’re having a conversation. If someone doesn’t like it, they can leave.”

I muted everyone and said something like “The rules for this group are very clear, and you have to acknowledge them before you join the call. If there’s an issue, we can talk about it after.”

The women all ended up leaving the group, and I got a bunch of nasty emails and tags on a few social media posts “calling me out” for being “pro-censorship” and “a tyrant” and saying how I shouldn’t be in charge of anything because of how “obviously biased” I am. 

I don’t think I’m in the wrong for this. My rules exist to make things welcoming for others. Sitting around putting down other people does NOT feel like it’s very welcoming, especially for snobby crap like they were doing.

AITA for not giving a bully’s mom a promotion?,"I am a 27(m) that works for a mid sized company in my home town. After college I moved back hole to help my mom get back on her feet after my dad passed away, and I was hired on with my current company and rose up fairly quickly through the ranks.

Last year my younger sister was having some issues at school with some girls bullying her, and my mom was going through the school trying to get it to stop. One day things got out of hand and one of the girls tossed my sisters clothes into the shower room during gym and turned them the showers on. I left work to take my sister some clothes because my mom was at a medical appointment and I saw a co-worker at the school. When my sister got home she told me that the bully always has something mean to say or do. 

It turns out the co-worker had also left to pick her daughter up because she was the the one who tossed the clothes in the shower room. She saw me leaving with my sister and approached me the next day at work to apologize. I sent human resource and my boss an email regarding the incident and didn’t think anything else from it. 

We had a position in management open up three weeks ago and she along with two others were up for the job. I interviewed two out of three as HR didn’t think it would be wise for me to interview her, and I agreed. At the end of the week my boss and I got together to see where we stood on the decision and he asked why I couldn’t set in on her interview. I reminded of the last incident and that was that. 

We ended up going with one of the other employees, and my boss remarked to me that her “failure in her home certainly didn’t help.” I guess I should feel bad about that, but honestly I don’t. 

The woman approached me after work while I was going to my car and asked if her daughters past action was an issue in the deciding factor and I told her she should speak to our manager and HR if she felt it was a biased interview, but gave her a little grin after. 

AITA?

Edit* 

I didn’t want this to go on for long so I won’t be replying anymore. Like so if you said, the adults here agree with me other than my grin. I can accept that. I think the best action here would be to have her transferred to another position under someone else. The hours are similar so that way it stays fair.

AITA for telling my brother-in-law to stop shitting in the bathroom with the door open while eating food?,"This is so absurd. I can’t believe I’m typing this out so that I can be judged by internet strangers. I’m pretty sure it’s right up there with that guy who shits in the shower. 

Recently, my brother-in-law (Dave) lost his job, couldn’t pay rent, and moved in with my partner and I. We have the space, so it was no big deal. 

It didn’t take long before I figured out that Dave is...sort of a neckbeard. He never cleans anything up, doesn’t really contribute to the house in any way, leaves dishes and food all over the place, and let’s not even talk about “can mountain”. He rarely cooks, and when he does, I’d rather he not. He has this awful habit of hacking up a raw chicken with a cleaver and little bits of flesh and liquid go everywhere. It’s a salmonella nightmare. I’ve stopped using my kitchen (not really but I wish I could).

Recently, I’ve started driving home for my lunch break, right around noon, so that I can get a few extra things done around the house. It’s because of this that I have found out that Dave’s favourite show is on at noon. And apparently Dave likes to eat lunch while watching the show FROM THE FUCKING TOILET. The man crawls out of his room around 11:45, dumps a bag of chips on a plate, puts a block of cheese on top, burns it up in the microwave, and strolls into the living room bathroom (which faces the television) and plops down on the toilet, leaving the door open so he can watch his damn show.

The man shits with the door open while eating food. It’s not even the open door shitting that drives me insane (I mean that’s gross too). It’s the FOOD IN THE BATHROOM. I’ve worked in a hotel for many years. I’ve seen a lot of shit (often times literally), and if there is one thing that always baffled and disgusted me, it was cleaning a room that had plates next to the toilet. I wondered what kind of monster eats in the bathroom. Well, it looks like one of those monsters in now living in my house. 

Long story short, I let it slide the first few days, as I was elsewhere in the house and it’s not like I had to look at him. But once I saw that it was a “thing”, I told Dave to stop taking food into the bathroom and close the damn door. He threw a fit, saying that he lives here too and I’m “shaming him for a normal activity (nothing of this is normal, in my humble opinion) and how would I feel if he had a problem with something I did like showering every day?”

 Now my partner is in on this mess, and told me to just let it happen to keep the family peace, as it’s not like it’s hurting anything to let Dave keep eating and shitting with the door open, and that I should just stop coming home for lunch or ignore it all. 

Reading this after I typed it out...WTF even is this. 

So internet, AITA? Should I really just let it slide to keep the peace until Dave moves out? Is eating in the bathroom a more common place/acceptable thing than I think it is and I’m being unreasonable about it?

AITA for immediately throwing my girlfriend's food in the trash and grounding my son over dairy?,"I have two kids. My daughter is severely allergic to dairy. My son is not. Both I and my kids' mother are very paranoid about any kind of cross contamination especially now that being able to go to a hospital isn't guaranteed, so we don't allow dairy in the house at all. We only go to or order from vegan restaurants and one meat kosher restaurant as well.

I've been dating a woman for about a year now who has a kid of her own. I've brought up the allergy at least once. We were starting a trial run of blending so she stays over a few days a month and she has a key. We usually order in when she comes to visit but she offered to cook dinner this time. 

I didn't know this, but she had decided to make baked ziti with a bacon ceasar salad and garlic bread. I get it, in most homes that would be delicious but here that can't happen. 

I walked in and just snapped. I instinctively grabbed the entire dish and everything that had clearly been used to make it and threw it into the garbage. My girlfriend started fighting with me but I just started yelling at her that it was dangerous and stupid of her to bring that shit in here knowing full well that [daughter] could die from it. 

After I got everything out of there and ordered new cookware, I ordered dinner for me and the kids. I asked her what she wanted but she refused, started crying and left and is now giving me the silent treatment. She's rallied her friends but I don't think I did anything wrong.

AITA for not letting my ex move?,"I am a 27(m) that lives in a southern state in the US. I have a little girl that is six years old with my ex-wife(f) who is 25. As you can tell we had her early and made the classic mistake of getting married well before either one of us were ready. 

My ex is originally from out west, and she and I met at college where she went on a scholarship here at our state school. She never really cared for life here but once she was pregnant she decided to try to plant roots here. It was a difficult time for her and it played a big part in breaking the marriage, but it was just one of the issues we had. 

We have been divorced for nearly six months now  with 60/40 custody. Me having our daughter the majority of the time because of her schedule or being on call. 

My ex tells me, and told me during the marriage, that she feels isolated here. Her parents, brothers/sister, and friends are back home. My ex wants to go back to her home state where her family is, but she wants to take our daughter. We’ve gone to court over this and the judge more or less told her she was free to go but she could not take our child which is where the conflict is.

I can’t even pick my daughter up or drop her off without having to listen to her beg me about going back home or having someone in her phone wanting to talk to me about it. I had to delete my FB and Twitter accounts because of constant tagging or messages from people. 

The thing is, she’s my daughters mother and I don’t hate her. We just weren’t to be, and it’s pretty obvious this is taking a toll on her. The field I work into is very very competitive, my daughters school, clubs, and my parents are all here so leaving isn’t really something I can do either.

AITA for refusing to let others see what my wife looks like right now?,"My (42M) wife (42F) has been getting treatment for Cushing’s Syndrome.

In terms of her visible symptoms, it was a quick onset regarding worsening redness and puffiness in her face, the fat buildup in the back of her neck “ Buffalo hump.” 

She has spent the past almost two years crying about how disgusting and depressed she felt and how her outward symptoms were showing little to no improvement.

I’ve cancelled a lot of our plans together ( basically anything that involves going out in public) and my wife ended up getting another job because she was tired of customers staring. 

My wife is friends with an employee who is basically the head of marketing for the business I work for.

The employee emailed both my wife and I to say that they had asked employees to send in holidays pictures to put on the business’ social media and website albums but barely anybody ended up doing so this year. She said she’d love to have some of us.

We take Christmas and New Year’s photos every year but this year our holidays were pretty stressful for my wife and she was particularly depressed when we were taking the photos because her symptoms were particularly bad.

She told me during pictures that she felt ugly.

When I got home, my wife was scrolling through pictures and picked out three that had all six of us ( we have four kids) in it.

I’m not going to mince words here- after looking at the photos, I cringed.

In nearly all the pictures we took, all her outward symptoms were apparent. 

I have been with this business since I was 27, and if anybody from the business saw pictures in company albums of me and my wife from then and at events in our early thirties, they would have thought she was absolutely gorgeous.

Actually one coworker saw a picture of us taken at a holiday party around 5 years ago and said my wife was so picture perfect.

My company has quite a gossip mill and I don’t want catty coworkers to talk about what happened to my wife either behind my back or god forbid strike up a conversation about it somehow some way.

I thought that if my wife continues to be diligent in her treatment, perhaps this will start going away and we can take pictures that we can both be proud of in the future.

So I reminded my wife she herself said she felt like a hippo during pictures and that she always used to post and then repost stuff on social media before all this so what’s to say she wouldn’t regret this too.

My wife asked if I was ashamed of her and I told her to just please forget about submitting anything this year.

AITA for asking my daughter’s father to take down the photos of our daughter (10mo) off of his dating apps,"So I recently downloaded bumble because I felt it was time to start putting myself out there again and maybe get to know some people during quarantine so when things do get normal I can go back into the dating world.

While swiping I saw my ex on there and one of his photos was a picture of him and our daughter. I texted him and asked him if he could take it down because I’m not comfortable with her photo on a dating app. I’m just not sure of who will see it and if people will only interact with him because they see a little baby girl. 

He seems very bothered and annoyed that I asked this, and thinks it’s going to be misleading if he does not have the photos and isn’t understanding why I’m uncomfortable and thinks my feelings are unnecessary/over dramatic.

AITA for refusing to give my mom a percent of my monthly allowance?,"I (M18) have just received my university social allowance of $640, basically a monthly salary from the government given to uni students as a “social bonus” and it’s exclusive to citizens in my country. Upon receiving the news my mom, a housewife financially depending on my dad, brought up the question how much of it she’ll be getting from me monthly.

I dreaded the question because I know it would pop up eventually. My older brother would give away half of his allowance ($320) monthly and he’s okay with it being an anti-social who sits around gaming all day. Me on the other hand not so much, being a somewhat of a social butterfly with hobbies and plans to fulfill. I admit I am taking way more than I need and there would be a “leftover” but I intent to save up for major purchases, eventually a car. I find it so stupid that people would be spending or saving so much more monthly while I’m spending less because of a mom who expects me to load her with a huge amount of my salary.

She expects $320, literally half of the salary monthly. I got straight to the point. I’m not keen of the idea of giving any of my allowance to her. It’s my money, I decide where and to whom it goes. Besides, she’s already receiving money from multiple sources and is now wanting to attach her drain to my bank too just to buy designer purses or whatever?? Is that all she expects from me? She obviously took it harshly, bringing up how hard she works for me back then during my school days, raising me, being a mother and etc. I offered $100 monthly and she just stormed out of the conversation giving the “Don’t talk to me ever again and you have no idea how disgusted I am by how you turned out to be” talk. I’ve heard it a million times before.

EDIT: For clarity she’s a housewife / unemployed by choice, still married, and not responsible for any bills, doesn’t even do the groceries or cooks the meals. We don’t live on rent and there’s no financial crisis as my dad is quite stable with his job despite the pandemic.

AITA for not returning my cat to its “rightful owner”,"I got my cat from a shelter back in 2017, and he is honestly one of my best friends. He is a beautiful Siamese kitty who I think I’ve done a great job taking care of. He was a kitten at the time, so now he’s a little over 3 years old. 

I posted him into a local “cat group” (this has tips for taking care of cats, new cat toys to buy, pics of cute cats, etc.) and someone commented “that’s my kitty!” 

I messaged and asked what they meant. She said he had escaped in 2016 and she hadn’t seen him. Now, like I said, my cat was about 4 months old in 2017, so how would he escape the prior year? Also, she sent me a picture of the kitten, and I will say the cat looked very very similar, but I can tell the markings were just a little different.

I tried to explain this to her and she became very angry. She said she wanted to see him in person, I refused. She said she was going to take me to court to prove that he’s hers, and that she’s his owner. I have all the paperwork on my cat, but I’m so scared I might lose him.

AITA for not allowing my sister to move in with me?,"So, I(28m) am a pro athlete. For privacy reasons I don't want to say which sport or which team, but I am decently successful, and own my own home. 

My current house is my dream house. It has a single floor, so it's not too big, but it has 3 rooms and a living and dining room. I have one room as my bedroom, I had the second room converted into a home gym, and I use the third room as a super good gaming room. Each of my specialised rooms are perfect for their purposes. My game room has a pc with a great monitor, a ps4, waiting on the ps5 upgrade, with a high quality tv. My gym has great equipment and is perfect for the off season.

I also have a decent sized yard, and 2 dogs with plans for a third. I have a decent sized friend group whom I invite over frequently, and often have sleepovers with. This typically isn't planned, we don't drink, but we just talk a lot and sometimes watch movies and end up falling asleep. 

Recently my sister got into a college near where I live. When she told me the news, she told me how great it was that we're gonna live together again. I told her I had no space, but she told me we could convert **our** gym into a bedroom for her, complete with a desk. 

This irked me because I love living alone. I like being able to get up and leave whenever I want. I like being able to watch whatever I want on the TV without judgement or scrutiny. I like not having to consider other people. 

Now, there are a number of examples I could give, where my sister is just a plain bad roommate. She doesn't exactly take care of other people's things when she borrows them, and she feels entitled to them if they're in the same house as her. 

She also has a habit of inviting people over without permission and forethought, which I obviously dislike. 

She is also a ""gamer"" and would like to play games on my console and pc. I obviously do not want her to do that, because knowing her, she'd probably break it, or she'd grow so attached to it she thinks it's really her property at that point. 

There are a hundred other things which she does, which I don't like, but you get the point. 

Now, I told my sister all of this, and she started off on me. She started yelling about how because I play for a living, I should help out people who actually have to work for money. She told me that I need to care for my family. 

My parents are staying out of it and saying that we're both adults and can figure this out for ourselves. They say if I don't let sis live with me, they'll pay for on campus lodging, but she'd have to have a roommate, which she doesn't want.

AITA for selling the family home that’s been in my late husband’s family since 1908,"My late husband inherited the family property thats been his family since 1908(when it was built). It’s a gorgeous estate with 7 bedrooms and 9 bathrooms, tennis court, in ground pool, 3 acres of land, horse stables. 


We’ve lived in it since my boys were younger but they are 19, 17, 15, and 13 now. We don’t use half the space or amenities anymore. I spend more on upkeep for things we don’t use than I do for upkeep on the things we do use! 



Anyway, when my husband inherited the house, the rest of the family hated us. They accused us of convincing his mom to change the will but in reality, she changed the will because none of the other kids gave a damn about her! She would’ve died holding the hand of her live in caregiver if we weren’t there, her other kids wouldn’t and didn’t show up until a few days after she passed despite living 2 towns over and being told it was their last chance to see her alive.


They got over it, we were still the “black sheep’s” but they at least faked being nice so the kids could play: So then my husband dies 4 years after his mom. 



After he died, his family cut contact with me and my boys completely. They refused to see my sons if I was going to be around. I don’t know why. They blamed me for not letting them see the boys because I wouldn’t leave my own house to let them come over or drop them off without speaking to someone first. 



Cut to now, my boys are starting to leave the nest. This house is huge, my joints hurt too much to walk to the other side sometimes. There will be times where a room goes untouched for months at a time. Living in this house was an honor and blessing but we truly don’t need it anymore. 



So like most people who downsize in their later years, I’m looking to sell it. 


I reached out to let my husband’s family know so they can visit one more time and get any furniture, antiques, or belongings that they didn’t get when MIL passed. 


Boy are they pissed. I also told them they could get the first “dibs” on buying it before we put it on the market. They were completely insulted that I would expect them to buy the house.


A family friend(childhood friend of my husbands so he’s friendly to all sides) said I’m “not wrong for selling but it ain’t right to make them buy their mother’s house” 



I get that but I feel like this is my sons’ house, not the family house or my house. The money I make off of the sale will go toward  a fund for them to use to buy their own houses one day.



Edit; thanks for all the responses and not calling me an asshole. Now I’ll probably look like one after this edit but please for the love of god stop telling me to rent it out. That is NOT an “easy fix”. I’d need to put money in to updating and repairs before anyone even looks at it. Then I’d be responsible for fixing all repairs ASAP for the tenant. And trust me there is ALWAYS something that needs to be fixed. It’s never a cheap or easy fix either. Property taxes still exist. The location isn’t great and it’s not getting better. It’s a mansion and I can’t imagine there are tons of people out there that have mansion money but would prefer to rent an old decrepit one instead of buying their own. We have talked to professionals and every one(lawyers, financial advisors, estate managers, contractors) agrees that renting would just drive it in the ground while not doing anything beneficial for us financially. 


I’d say the only way renting would be a good idea is if we can find someone like Chip and Joanna that would turn the remodel in to a TV show and funded it on their own. The odds of that happening are very slim I’d imagine!",Not the A-hole
WIBTA for not giving my youngest niece a savings account with money for when she turns 18 when I gave one to her older sisters?,"

So over a decade ago I was made a lot of money with a not so legal business transaction (I’m not going to go into it and I am not asking if I am an asshole for that). 

During that time I spent a lot of the money on a bunch of stupid stuff. I have a general idea of the amount of money I went through, but I was heavily into drugs at the time so I hardly remember what I actually spent it all on.

I recently found out after going through some old paperwork that I had started a savings accounts for my two older nieces. Both of them were really happy to hear about the money. The problem is I also have another niece (their younger sister) that I did not set up an account for. I wasn’t talking to my family much back then and she was a baby so it wouldn’t surprise me if between that and the drugs I just forgot about her or maybe didn’t even know she existed yet.

Anyway my sister is saying how unfair it is that her youngest is not getting anything and that I should make it equal between them so I don’t hurt her feelings. The money in the accounts however is not legally mine anymore, so neither me nor my sister can touch the money and redistribute it and the older two do not want to share. So the only way to make it equal would be to give my youngest niece the same amount of money from my own money. 

If I’m being honest though I wouldn’t have given any of them that type of money now though. I mean that’s a lot of money. I think it’s pretty crazy I gave them that much money to begin with. I just don’t think I was in the right mind then, but I’m not going to argue about that money. What’s done is done. That’s theirs, but does it mean I owe their sister the same thing?

It would be the majority of my savings that I would rather keep for emergencies especially considering how iffy things are nowadays. My sister doesn’t know a lot about my finances, but she knows that I have this vintage car that I bought with the money I made back then. She looked up what they’re selling for on eBay and thinks I should sell the car to make it fair with her youngest since in her words I never use it. It’s really more that I just rarely use it since it’s not a great everyday car. It’s a fun car to take out on the weekends though and I love the thing. I don’t want to sell it.

Which led to my sister saying I could just put a little bit of money into an account so it adds up to around the same amount by the time her youngest turns 18. Which just like tacking on a large bill for something I don’t need.

Plus I know our younger brother and his wife who are expecting want to have a bunch of kids too. I don’t want to have to set a precedent. Of course my sister says I already did. I don’t think that should count since I don’t even remember doing it.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not inviting my “friend” who’s in a wheelchair to my cabin trip,"I’m planning a cabin trip with three close friends.  I already have an itinerary planned that includes snow sledding, skiing, and other active activities. I’ve already sent out said itinerary to my three close friends. I sent out the itinerary and requests for reimbursements as I’ve already booked the Airbnb. The trip is in March and I never mentioned the cabin trip to Tameka directly as I didn’t plan to invite her as I didn’t see any scenario where it would be fun for her to just sit around while we’re hiking and skiing. I also don’t see her as a close friend. She’s more of an acquaintance and I never invite her when I plan a dinner or brunch. Two of my friends are close with her and tend to invite her to events and outings and girls nights. Typically, when there’s a lunch or dinner my other friends will invite “Tameka” but I never invite her to the get togethers at my house. Tameka is in a wheelchair. My apartment doesn’t have an elevator and I live on the fourth floor so even if we were close, i don’t see how she’d get up there. To my surprise I got a payment today from Tameka for the cabin trip. I’m very confused as I didn’t mention the trip to her and she’s not even in the separate group chat that’s just the four of us. I immediately sent her money back and all hell broke loose. She accused me of being ableist and mentioned how I never invite her to my home. I explained why and I also explained why I didn’t invite her to the cabin trip. One of the reasons being we’re not close and that she’s more of a mutual friend. The two friends that are close to Tameka are calling me an asshole and my other friend who’s not close to her is siding with me. It’s honestly a mess and I’m considering cancelling the whole trip.

AITA for snapping at my SIL for telling me how I should've raised my kids,"Comparatively speaking we were strict parents to my kids(23m/27f/30f).

We also have a great relationship with all of them. We talk with each of them at least once a week and we have a family dinner every other week. The conflict is with my SIL. She has a more permissive parenting style and allowed her daughter 22f to experiment with drugs/sex/alcohol during her teenage years. This wouldn’t be an issue except for the fact that she’s always critical of my parenting style. Whenever we talk about our kids’ upbringing she always finds a way to call us too strict. This is unacceptable end of itself, but I believe it is more egregious due to the fact that her daughter is a bit of a wild child. She dated a lot in highschool which unfortunately led to her being bullied and later resulted in a rumor that she was dating my son.  This came to a head when my SIL was convinced my oldest was this crazy partier in college but was hiding it from me. My daughter told her that wasn’t the case and even if it was I would’ve already known about it since we wouldn’t care and she tells her mother everything. This wasn’t  enough for my sil and she kept insisting my kids had some sort of secret rebellion. I snapped and pretty much told her that just because her daughter was this crazy partier doesn’t mean mine are and that she the last person I would take parenting advice from . She pretty much just shut up and left after that. She also won’t talk to my wife unless I apologize.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not accommodating my (21F) roommate's (20sF) anxiety?,"My lease ended when I graduated college in May 2018. Luckily for me, my friend Kylie was moving out of her apartment the same month, and she agreed to sublet me her room until her lease was up in August, when I was going to move for a job. Her roommate Jolene, who had the other room in the apartment OK'd it and I moved in at the end of May, having talked to her over text but never in person. Kylie had told me she had anxiety, and having had roommates with anxiety before I assumed that I would know how to coexist.

The first day I moved in, she was in the kitchen when I was bringing up my boxes. I said hi and she said nothing. For the rest of the time we lived together, whenever I asked her a question I would get single-word responses, if that. Most of our communication was through sticky notes Jolene left around the house.

Our communication never improved despite my efforts to open up conversations. At one point, she was upset that she could hear me and my girlfriend having sex, so she texted Kylie and asked her to ask us to keep it down.

After that incident I texted her apologizing and asked if we could have a sit down chat to discuss ground rules, and offered that we could do it over text if she wanted. She seemed open to the idea, but when I asked her what day and time worked for her she ignored my message.

One day in July, my girlfriend and I had come to my place after a date, and arrived at 8 to find none of our lights worked. Assuming it was a power outage, we retired to my room, but then came back out to make some sandwiches. There we found that the kitchen power was on. My girlfriend investigated the fuse box and found that all except the kitchen had been turned off. I assumed that our ISP had come by (they said they'd be coming that week) and turned them off, so we flipped them back on, and went back to my room. 5 minutes later, our power died again, and there was a note next to the fuse box reading ""if this is off, DON'T turn it back on."" This is probably an asshole move, but I was frustrated with Jolene so I turned them back on and went to the bathroom. She came out of her room and snipped at my girlfriend that the power company was paying us to have our power off and turned it back off. She hadn't informed me at all about this.

I suggested a roommate meeting again, and was again ignored. At this point I was frustrated, and began  giving her hours' rather than days' notice for having friends over (in my room exclusively), and when she messaged me saying I had triggered her anxiety and that I can't make unilateral decisions for the apartment. I responded that I was sorry, but that she had started making unilateral changes by turning my power off, and that I wanted to govern our apartment by agreed upon rules rather than unexplained expectations, asking once more if we could talk rules out. She didn't respond until a week before I moved out, saying that it wasn't worth it at that point.

AITA for giving my GF an ultimatum?,"Both my GF and me are in university. As you can imagine, we aren't millionaires. However, luckily I do have expertise in a particular area, which allowed me to make certain things and sell them online as an ""online business"". Its a digital product so I don't need to spend ridiculous amount of time on it, and I earn about 300 a week. 

My GF, on the other hand, whilst not poor by any chance, does not have a job or any form of income. Her parents aren't Jeff Bezos so she only gets living expenses on top of her tuition fees. We are both against having a regular job at this point because we are both focusing on academics and don't have the time. So i'm not blaming her in any way for not having a job. 

Ever since we got together, I have been more or less funding her current lifestyle. I pay for dinner, I buy her things etc. I'm more than happy as I'm not really into food or anything to be honest. My parents gifted me a very good PC (which is what I use to earn money) before I left so I'm content with that. 

However, recently I noticed her spending habits have increased, to the point where basically my entire weekly income was being used. I asked her why and after some questioning she said its because of her sister. Now, it'd be generous to say I don't exactly like her sister, so to find out my money was being used on her sister pissed me off. I said I will absolutely not spend a single dime on my GF's sister. 

She then started to diminish her own spending to spend money on her sister in hopes I don't see it, but I can because I can see the charges on my card and it is obviously not something my GF would use. Again, I told her no, stop doing that. She agreed but kept doing it anyways.

I gave her an ultimatum. Either stop this behavior, or I will stop giving her money all together, not a single cent. She kept calling me an asshole. Her logic is ""Since you are spending money on me anyways, I will just use that money on my sister, its non of your business"". However, its my money, so the way I see it I should have a right to decide how can use my money.

AITA for refusing to pay for my daughter's wedding?,"I think, I need to give a background information before explaining the details.

I (47M) met my wife (49F) when we were in our mid twenties. She was a single parent. I have been in our daughters' (26F) life for 22 years. Her biologically father was not in the picture till she was about 13. He had been an addict and he cleaned up his life, My wife waited till he was sober for more than a year before trusting him enough to meet his daughter.

My daughter grew distant from me and we took some time to adjust the dynamics of our relationship (we did a lot of family therapy), She adores her father, they both are charming, sporty and outgoing people while I am more of a introvert and bookish in my interests. We still had a great relationship but I went from being her sole father figure to being a her step dad. It was hard but I knew that she had every right to spend time with and bond with her father.

She got married when she was 21 and just out of college. I paid for most of the wedding. Her best friend during her Speech thanked her father for paying for the wedding. I was a bit irked by that but I chalked it up as a mistake but my daughter went ahead and posted the same thing on Social Media. 

My wife had been furious and wanted to confront her about it but I have always abhorred confrontation, it was not an expense we had to make huge sacrifices for and it was not like she was going to get married again. Her marriage fell apart in just a year.

Last week, We were facetiming her and she came out to as us and introduced to her fiancée. I think we handled it pretty well. we were very surprised but we told her that we loved her and she loved her no matter and that we hoped we could meet her Fiancée after the pandemic.

Yesterday, she facetimed us and asked us for some money for the wedding. we still feel a bit wounded about what happened during the last wedding and refused to fund this one.

she went really quiet and then started shouting at us for being homophobic and not recognizing what she had with her girlfriend was real. She then started crying and cut the call. we tried calling her back but she rejected our calls.

I really can understand how difficult it is to come out. I am bisexual too, I have only come out to my wife and that 10 years in to our marriage. I knew my parents were never going to accept me if I came out and even though we had a good relationship till they passed away. it gnawed at me that if I had fallen in love with a man. They would have disowned me. it is a corrosive feeling and it makes you second guess everything. I think she has similar worries about father, who is a bit more religious and comes from a very religious background.

I feel we have have stepped on a land mine and when we refused to pay for the wedding and by refusing to get of it she will forever question if we support her by holding a petty grudge.",Not the A-hole
AITA for embarrassing a girl on clothing ethics,"I'm 29 and my girlfriend is 27. We were at a socially distanced gathering and my girlfriends friend had a weird flex on how she's been environmentally responsible during her time during the pandemic. She drives a tiny car and works retail for an athleisure store. She also took up painting as a hobby during last year. She was laid off from her old job so she had lots of time to spare in 2020.

She kept boasting and bragging about how she's shrunk her environmental footprint while looking down on everyone else who hasn't done that over the past year. She mentioned how she walks to get groceries and buys locally (she still shops on Amazon, ironically enough). I should also note that my girlfriend and I both studied geology and have a both worked in the energy sector. From four years of school, I learned that basically everything is comprised of some type of hydrocarbon. We didn't judge her for being environmentally responsible. Her cockiness though was not necessary.

My girlfriend and I subtly pointed out that she still drives a Ford that runs on gasoline, the flight she got off of three weeks prior happened to run on jet fuel, the paint she uses frequently for her new hobby is an alkyl (synthetic oil) product and the clothes she sold to customers 5 days a week happened to also be made out of nylon. Much to her surprise, nylon is a thermoplastic fabric made directly from crude oil by a child in another country. It was tough for her visibly as she was completely dressed in Lululemon clothing and a Google search of nylon was a click away.

I felt bad ""mansplaining"" the basic concept of crude oil production but unless you make your own clothes from scratch, don't use any form of transportation and manage to stay warm during the winters without a furnace or electricity, you're really not contributing to anything remotely effective environmentally.

Now my friend Mandi is obese, not trying to body shame it just is a fact (this is important later) and she and her husband have been trying to conceive since before he left. 

I work out daily, usually multiple times a day in my living room. I also am on a strict diet (no breads/ heavy starches/ sugars etc). Mandi is convinced I have an eating disorder which is not true, I enjoy fitness and have stomach issues so my diet is really good for me. I've never pushed my diet or exercising on Mandi but when she watches me work out or cook she tells me I need to eat more and working out so much is going to hurt my body later. 

This weekend I was doing laundry and was in shorts and a bra and Mandi asked me to talk. She said I'm starting to look ""emaciated"" and it was ""gross to watch her friend starve herself to death"". I told her I am a good weight/ bmi fom my height (I'm 5'8 135lbs have been for a long time).  She said she knows I starve myself (I eat 3-4 times a day just usually small plates loaded with veggies and lean meats) and that ""women are supposed to be curvy, not boney"". 

I got upset and asked if she thought her body was the ideal and she said her body was more ""natural"". I told her I would literally have to triple my weight to be her size and she got mad and told me not to fat shame her. I said she was skinny shaming me and I feel she is upset because she knows she has to lose weight in order to conceive as her doctors told her and she doesn't want to.

AITA For Not Letting My Sister Borrow My Sword Collection?,"Obligatory mobile warning.

I collect military memorabilia and antiques. Considering the fact that I'm a 20 year old university student, I have a pretty decent collection of swords, helmets, knives, and other assorted knickknacks. Yesterday, my sister asked me if she could borrow a couple of my swords for her schools theater production. I flat out said no, I spent a lot of money on those swords and they're my babies. Plus the two she wanted to borrow are both antiques, 101 and 135 years old respectively. 

She's now really mad at me because apparently the swords they were going to use for the play broke, and with the production being a bit over a week away, they need prop swords ASAP. But because of Covid, they're having trouble finding some that can be delivered in time. I've had my phone blown up by both my sisters asking/demanding that I give them the swords for the play, and I'm still refusing to let them leave my possession. Both sisters are saying I'm being a huge AH for not helping the one out, and saving the production as a result. But I'm worried about people I don't know swinging around an antique sword and potentially breaking it. They did break the first set of prop swords, so I feel like this is a somewhat justified fear.

My sisters also pointed out that I don't use them for anything other than decoration, as they're both hanging on the wall in my bedroom. So it's not like I'm going to need them anytime soon. But I still am uncomfortable with the idea of people who have no idea what they are using them like a cheap knockoff and breaking them.

AITA for telling my sister to leave after she got angry at me and my kids for making loud noises in MY own home,"My little sister and I live in the same city. She goes to college and I’m a SAHM with three kids (3F, 3F, 4M). Her school sent everyone home for online classes last March and it’s been that way since. However, she has a yearlong internship in the city that started in August and she asked if she could stay at my place, which I was fine with. I didn’t even ask her to pay rent because I know all her internship money is going to pay off her student loans. However, since she’s been here full time, we’ve been having a lot of problems with her. 

We had a spare guest room for her but it was at the exact opposite end of our house from our router in the basement. She’s been complaining that the internet is not great in there and bugging us about switching with the kids playroom which has a Ethernet port, but my husband and I shut that idea down. We didn’t want to disrupt our kids lives anymore than the pandemic had already done and the guest room is much smaller. We also have a built in white board and LEGO table in the playroom so it wouldn’t be easy to switch rooms. 

She does her own chores like her laundry and cleaning her dishes but if I ask her to help cook a meal or to watch my kids occasionally when I need to go run an errand she refuses saying she’s too busy. She doesn’t like children and basically just avoids/ignores my kids at home so it’s weird for them. Final straw was after a month in, she came downstairs one day while my kids were watching tv and running around playing and screamed at us that she was in a meeting and she was sick of us making loud noises all day.

AITA for refusing to move back home based on a promise I made a decade ago?,"I am 35, and I had a bumpy road with my education. Over the years there were many semesters delayed a bit due to taking time off to work and save money for tuition. But I graduated a few months back and finally have a PhD!

It took me longer than it should, really, and my parents were always there to help when I was short on rent or needed car repairs or grocery money even though I was an adult. Sometimes they just sent me money because they were thinking of me. I cant thank them enough - their support (both emotional and financial) really were crucial to my success.

Back when I was new into academics, I left my small town to study at a bigger university. I had promises out my arse that I would be back to set up a life near my family, and I really meant it at the time. It was the only place I knew and could not imagine a bigger world while I lived there. 

It took me longer than I planned. I now live many miles away from my family but I met a partner and we settled down together. We have a cat together!  We have shared everything. I have friends and mentors here, many job opportunities, and I am really happy in this new city. I am not ready to leave.

Now that I graduated my parents are bombarding me with job postings near them and reminding me of my promise. We are a *very very* family oriented comminity. I have been delaying the conversation and making some hints of wanting to stay put where I live now,  which haven't been taken well so far.

I feel so split. I'd like to stay here, but I did make a promise and I love my family and owe them so much. AITA if I refuse to follow through?

AITA for telling my friend “Its not my fault that I have boundaries with my kids”?,"Like many people who want kids, I had grand ideas about what kind of parent I’d be when I had kids.

When my kids became toddler age and could understand, I told them unless they’re bleeding or the house is on fire, don’t bother me in the bathroom. Anything else can wait. It did take a few times of the door jiggling or them passing me things but eventually they stopped and learned the boundary. (Equal respect, I don’t go in the bathroom when they’re using it once they can use the toilet on their own)

My kids are now 8, 5 & 3. I have a friend with a kid who’s also 3. We were talking about the kids and she told me “yeah, I haven’t peed alone since (child) learned to walk”. I replied that I nip that in the bud early on. She asked me to explain, so I told her above. She said that’s mean and I said no, it’s setting a boundary. My 8 year old would hate it if I walked in on her. She said that we should always be accessible to our kids. I said if it’s truly an emergency, they know to tell me. She kept arguing and finally I said, “Its not my fault I have boundaries with my kids.  You don’t. That’s cool.”

AITA for Convincing my Landlord to Evict my Roommate?,"So Reddit, for any of you that have seen previous posts by me, it's no secret that my roommate and I don't get along. That said, I always tried to tolerate him even when he deliberately does something to bug me, and while I have asked Landlord (he rents out a couple rooms in his house for those of you who don't know, hence why I literally live with Landlord) to address a few things with him, I never asked for anything as extreme as kicking him out.

I even once let a very dumb move go a few months ago: he left his keys in the door after getting home. While I was absolutely furious, as I am a rather absent minded myself, but even I never did anything so stupid as to leave my keys right in the doorknob where any asshole could take them and literally come back at any time to rob the place, I gave him his keys back, and said I'd drop it on the condition he bought a clip keychain with a retractable cord that you could attach to your belt loop

He tried to refuse, as he's a cheapskate, but I told him that I was already informing Landlord of the incident, and if he didn't do this, I'd have to add that he refused to take steps to prevent a repeat incident, so he grumbled, but still had the clip, albeit not in the most timely manner (it took two weeks).

In this endless pile of hay, the last straw came last night when he could very easily have BURNED THE HOUSE DOWN. You see, Landlord uses an old fashioned propane stove that cooks things with a controlled flame. Roommate was cooking some steak, and rather than put the plastic spatula on a napkin on the counter, he left it on the stove in a precarious position, right next to the flame.

I came out of the bathroom, having been showering, just in time to see the now on fire spatula fall to the floor, and in a panic, I immediately ran, picked up the non burning part, and put it in the sink. I ended up with a painful blister right above my eyebrow, and a ruined shirt as a result of melted plastic having flown up at me when I picked the damn thing up.

After cleaning up the mess, luckily no burn marks were on the floor as I had acted on time, I banged on Roommate's door and unloaded on him, as I was completely pissed at the accident.

He didn't seem to care, and simply said that he would buy a new spatula and shirt for me, and didn't seem to get that it wasn't about either of those things. Absolutely done with him, I waited for Landlord to return, sat him down and explained that I no longer felt safe in his home, and either Roommate was to be evicted ASAP, or I would be moving out myself.

Landlord, while reluctant to kick out Roommate during a pandemic, nonetheless agreed he was too much of a liability at this point, and wrote up a notice that Roommate now had thirty days to find another place to live.

Roommate has begged, but Landlord will not budge. Now he is threatening to sue me for... I don't even know what he could sue me for, defamation? Anyway, am I overreacting here?",Not the A-hole

Anna was thinking today about what she wants to wear to court. Because of her profession (recruiter) she owns a lot of smart clothing anyway, but she thought it wouldn't hurt to get something especially for court.

We purchased a new pair of heels for her and made a shortlist of the dresses/suits she liked the most so she can make a decision soon. It was a pretty fun day overall.

AITA for excusing my atheist son from a family dinner after he was being rude to our guest?,"This happened quite awhile ago but grudges are still being held so here we are. I have two children (Son 21, daughter 18) from my previous marriage and one with my current wife. It was the evening after my youngest's baptism and we were having a family dinner to celebrate that and my engagement to my wife. My wife and I are good friends with the pastor so after the baptism we invited him to join us with his wife for the dinner. The more the merrier. Now my 18 year old son, Jim, is quite the staunch atheist whereas the rest of us are Christians. We kind of just let each other be at this point because once he starts, things get spoiled. So we were at the table and the pastor offered to say grace and asked us all to bow our heads. Jim didn't and immediately went for his phone which caused an awkward pause until the pastor just started. I found this a bit disrespectful especially when there are guests but I left it for a possible conversation afterwards.

We were eating and talking when Jim brought up that he'd been asked to come for interviews at two different companies. The pastor thanked God, said an encouraging short verse (the verse alone- he didn't get into a sermon) then congratulated my son. Jim laughed and then put his hands together and said something like ""Yes, peace to you oh great sky dad"" then scoffed. This caused yet another awkward moment where everyone was uncomfortable. It's not even about feeling embarrassed it's the pastor but feeling embarrassed that my son was disrespecting a guest who was just being encouraging and wishing him well. I told him to behave and changed the topic. We started talking about how hot it was in the church earlier and the pastor mentioned that they've been meaning to address that for awhile now. Jim jumped in again and 'asked' when they're planning to address the homeless. I asked to speak to him in the living room and he couldn't see anything wrong with what he said so I excused him and went back to the table. He left and the dinner continued smoothly. 

Later though when I checked back in with him he said that I was wrong to just kick him out like that when he specifically came to town just for the dinner and it was my fault for just inviting the pastor and letting him do his 'Jesus' things to him knowing that Jim was atheist. Aita?

"AITA for refusing to help out my(30) sister(34) who ""might"" be pregnant?","The relationship between me and my sister has always been a little complicated. She treated me poorly in my teens though she is only a couple years older.

I had some personal issues during that time and ended up homeless after i ran away. I cut contact with my family until well into my 20s. My parents are very loving people. It was me who decided to go because of a person i fell in love with.

With a public program i was able to get back on my feet, graduated from highschool and got a scholarship for a good College. I worked hard and have now a reasonably well paid job, a nice flat and - you won't believe it - savings.

I invited my parents to my inauguration and my sister tagged along. It was the day i started having more contact and also more issues with my family.

My sister made some weird choices. She left college to pursue a model career that ended with her being an addict and some sort of high class escort.

You'd think she'd earn enough to sustain herself being ""high class"" but it seems there is a lot she isn't telling.

Now. My life is rather peaceful and simple.

A few weeks back someone banged at my door. It was my completely wasted sister. I led her in, helped her clean herself and made her some food. She crashed on my couch.

I woke up and she basically robbed me. My credit card and cash was gone, some cheap vase and a plant (whyever).

I blocked all my cards and she didn't use them luckily. So all is good but the 40 bugs cash.

I called my parents and told them that this is unacceptable. They talked to her and she pretends it never happened.

I found the plant, the vase and my cards in an envelope in front of my door the day after. I thought i am in a freaking movie.

Silence came back for a few weeks until last Friday. When she banged again at my door, wasted again. I led her in but insisted in calling her a taxi home. She started crying and told me a rather wild addict story and that she is pregnant now.

So basically she wants me to let her move in, help her until she gives birth and just ""be at her side like a real sister"".

I refused. I refused very firmly. There was no point in discussing it (at least for me).

I talked this over with my (very fresh) partner. They say i could have been nicer and letting her down will just worsen everything. My parents don't know anything about this yet.

I also talked with a friend and she said ""you have a good life. You should share it with your sister. You act pretty egoistic and selfish"" (Edit: she had an addict baby brother that she took care of, so her POV is very valid to me. But she is like those families who help eachother out regardless.)

My sister called me up today and talked some cheesy crap about sisterhood and woman sticking together. She was very angry when i kept refusing and painted me the worst person on earth.

I disagree. and honestly, i feel like i am made the AH here for their own purposes. So AITA?

TL;DR: Left home in my teens, worked hard to have a good and peacful life now. Sister comes back into the picture being an addict and is now pregnant. Wants help, i refused instantly to protect my peace.

EDIT: My parents are able to provide for themselves but other than that they currently live in a one room app. Life hasn't been easy for them since i left. I didn't tell them yet bc they are loving parents and want to see if this is just an addict episode or real. Kinda want to protect them from this bs.

AITA for saying I don't want to spend time with my sister on my birthday?,"I kind of considered making a wider post on this but I think this one thing is better suited to the sub.

Okay, so, I (16f) have a sister (14f) who I had a good relationship up until we were 7 and 9. She was always eager to spend time with me. But I was always into spending time with her too. We got along really well. Then she started getting clingy and when I told her to stop and brought it up to my parents nothing changed. She got jealous of my friends. When I did include her she would try to hog me to herself. About 6 months after it started she pushed one of my friends over because my friend had my attention for a few minutes and my sister didn't like it. My parents grounded her for it but they told me I shouldn't have ignored her.

Except I didn't.

I just didn't give her my undivided attention.

I still spent time with her after that but when it was clear she would keep getting jealous and possessive I stopped letting her hang out with my friends.  Then over time I just stopped wanting to spend any time with her.

My parents have never let me stop though. They make a point of forcing me to spend at least one Saturday a month doing something with her and cultivating the relationship. And I hate it. I hate it because she is still so needy and clingy. I can't take my attention off her or she's like a toddler demanding to be seen.

My birthday is coming up in February and I have made virtual plans with friends. My sister wanted to hang out for some of it and I said no. My parents said I can't do that. I told them I would leave the house without her and walk around all day but my birthday is not going to turn into another day for her to demand all my attention. They said family is important and I told them healthy family is important but I shouldn't have to spend time with someone who demands it and wants my full attention always. I said I should be allowed to talk to my friends without her making a fuss, I should be able to trust that I can look at or speak to someone else and not have her become an emotional leech who keeps wanting more and more. They said it was a cruel thing to say.

I told them they should say that to my best friend when my sister told her to fuck off four months ago because my sister wanted to hang out with me and I was playing a game with my best friend.  I told them to say that to my friend she pushed who she still claims is an asshole for taking my attention away from her that day and getting into trouble. I told them I will not spend time with her on my birthday and if they try and force me I will take whatever punishment they dish out because I am not doing it anymore.

After about 6 months of finding out being a single mom was not what it cracked up to be, she adopted the baby out with my father’s consent. It was

16 years later, I was born. When I was 10, my bio halfsister tried contacting my dad. I was explained what had happened, and my dad met up with her a few times over lunch. His stance was essentially that he was happy to give her family history, medical files etc. But that he was not really looking forward to a relationship.

When I was 12 or so she ended up on our doorstep with her son, because she wanted his grandfather ""to see him"". Only my dad was away on a business trip that time, and it was just me and my mom. It was my first time seeing her in the flesh. It was very uncomfortable, and my mother asked her to leave.

At some point, she started writing me physical letters, in the beginning it was mostly just tidbits about her life, but later letters were more about how she wanted to meet me and how she was sad she didn’t get to meet her sister etc.

I finally met her at 16 , at my grandma’s funeral. Apparently she had been trying to contact that side of the family, too, and my grandmother and aunt (father’s younger sister) were more receptive.

At that point she sort of invited me to her house to catch up. I discussed this with my parents, and they said it was upto me.

I did and it was awkward. She was dumping all of her abandonment issues on me. She was literally twice my age, and in retrospect I find it really inappropriate.

It sort of fizzles out until her second child was born. She started contacting me and my dad actively again, wanting this family thing we were not really going for. 

She was doing other bothersome things. I added her to social media, and she found my pictures of birthday, and wrote “I missed this one”, and “Missed that one, too” under pictures etc.

As far as I know, her adoptive parents were perfectly nice people, btw.

We went pretty low contact for a few years, but then my dad got sick. When he was dying, she came to say goodbye with the kids (they most certainly overstayed their welcome).

When he passed, she started the drama again. She didn’t like our funeral arrangements, wanted to set up her own service to say goodbye (I said she had my blessing, but she specifically wanted me to do it) etc.

Recently she’s started to ask me for old pics (which I accommodate) but I’m getting tired of it.

I do not feel this woman is my “sister”. She has parents, the ones who adopted her. I tried to be accommodating as much as I can, but I feel this obsession with me and my dad was really unhealthy. The older I get, the more I feel this way. Another thing is my partner and I might be considering a baby and I don’t want her to fixate on my child again when we do.

WIBTA for getting a new therapist because mine was 20 minutes late?,"i (m16) have been in therapy with this therapist for about a year and a half and the entire time there’s been problems with her being late. one day, about 2 months ago, she was 40 minutes late and then emailed me asking if i was coming (i had been there on time for 35 minutes and then started to leave) she’s apologized and she’s tried to be better with being on time. 

i’ve told her that as long as she tries to tell me she’s going to be late (sends an email, pops out to the waiting room to tell me she’s going to be late) i’ll be happy, but last session she was 20 minutes late and i got upset and refused to go in for our session and went home (she apologized and said she wouldn’t charge me) 

she told me that she had been aware of the time but she didn’t feel like it was right for her to leave the session with someone (it was their first session and i’m assuming they were talking about some difficult things) to tell me she was going to be late. if it was the first time, i wouldn’t care so much. but this has happened multiple times and she knows how i feel about when she’s late and doesn’t let me know. she also didn’t seem to be that sorry about that last session. she’s suggested we move our appointment time by 15 minutes so if the appointment before mine runs late i won’t be as late, but i don’t know if she’s having all of her clients move their appointment times by 15 minutes so i feel like it’d just be making all the appointments after mine even later. 

i get that she was talking about some hard stuff and didn’t think it was right to come out and let me know, but her being late is a regular thing and she’s had 2 months since i first addressed the issue.

AITA for refusing to give roommate things to sell and planning to move out cause I caught her in my room,"I (28NonBinary) live with my roommate Shelly. We go 50/50 on rent, electric, heat and internet. Not food, not phones or car. She has a car I don't. 

She lost her job and has been selling stuff on eBay. I let her sell my old gaming headset cause I got a new one. One time thing,  she knows this. 
 Today she said they're turning off her phone soon and begged if she could sell a pop she knows I have. It sells between 100-300$ depending if your desperate to have it.  It's Hollow Ichigo from Bleach.  I told her no way in hell. I spent 80$ on him and he's my most expensive one. She said she'd buy new another one but I asked her how if she's not working and can't afford her  phone and gas money.  She asked if I'd give her anything else to sell (I'm a gamer and have a lot of collectables) and I said no. 

I work from home so when I'm not here I keep my door locked and I told her after she called me an asshole that if I see her trying to open my door I'll move out. 

Well she tried opening my door when she thought I was sleeping so I told her that's it, I'm out of here and will be telling the landlord I'll give her two months before I leave. 

She's saying I'm a huge asshole and I'm saying she is for trying to sell my stuff and that I don't trust her.

AITAH for not lowering rent due to cancer?,"I am a 27f  hair salon owner. I worked for my ex boss (J ) for almost 3 years. She was my mentor in many ways and I was happy to have her rent a chair from me so she could work toward retirement.
After 1 year J has left the salon. Built a salon in her house

She decided to move after a while and lost her home salon and I agreed to rent again at a reduced rate as I was led to believe by her that her referring customers to the salon when she couldn’t do them and that she was going to be working one less day per week she should get a reduction. So I did. Twice actually! We still had a monthly contract though which did not renegotiate the terms, just the rent amount. 

When I’m allowed to reopen after pandemic closure I can operate 3 of 6 styling chairs. It was a fine line between giving my paying renters time to work and giving my employees enough hours. With some sacrifices I make it work.

During pandemic J’s husband is diagnosed with cancer and she can’t work for 6-8 months cause he’s at risk if she brings something home. She wants to come back sooner than she initially said and just on Sundays when no one else worked, less risk. I agreed, she didn’t ask any questions so I thought we would continue as normal like pressing play after a pause. She contacted me in the 2nd half of October so I was expecting her to start November first as per the contract of month to month.

Nope. She schedules herself the coming Sunday and asks all her customers that have upcoming appointments to switch back to her. ( J should have planned ahead and called them prior to returning so they can make future plans.) I ended up with lots of last minute cancelation because of this. 

 I ask J to make a rent payment before she works again and she asks to renegotiate price again. Her reasons: her husband has cancer so she can’t work as much and some of her customers kept their appointment with me instead of switching so that should compensate some rent. I say no this time on a business level I can’t justify any greater deal than she already has. It’s less than half what she started off paying despite my rent has increased every year.

Well J blows up on me saying I’m not being flexible enough with working days and rent price (she kept suggesting her rent price per day is X therefore if she only was going to work X days she should pay X amount.) she says I’m “slamming the door in her face and don’t want her back” and every conversation she would slide in how her life is hard and her husband has cancer. 

I gave her several warnings to keep our rent contract purely business. It felt like she was using my naivety of a young new business owner, our friendship, and her personal situation to influence me. She brought it up again and I snapped. I told her Ive lost respect for her since she keeps using the cancer to make me feel like a horrible person for not lowering her rent.

AITA for hanging up on my mom when she insisted on discussing my child's death?,"TW: pregnancy, death.

tl;dr: Mom calls unexpectedly to tell me that our unborn child's future death is ""all taken care of."" I hang up.

My wife (35F) and I (34M) are expecting our first child soon (finally!). We are ecstatic to be opening this new chapter of our lives and are in the throes of planning for the baby's arrival.

A few days ago, my mom (69F) called me out of the blue. She almost never calls to chat even though every time I call her I ask her to reach out more, because I miss her and want to make sure she is doing ok (she lives in another state). 

My mom called to tell me that she is doing some end-of-life planning and has purchased a cremation package for her and her new husband, and she wanted to share the details with me so that I can handle the process if and when it is needed. She then says she has also obtained cremation and burial for my unborn child as a free bonus, so long as he dies before turning 21.

I am a bit taken aback at this, since we are focused on our soon-to-be-child's life, not the possibility of his premature death. My mother insists that we need to be planning for it and I should see this as a gift so that if my unborn child dies prematurely, its ""all taken care of."" I tell her that while I understand what she was going for, this is exceedingly morbid, and that we are perfectly capable of handling such things should they occur, but we do not want to be planning for our child's death before he is even born. We would much rather plan for his life. Furthermore, I say that this is the sort of thing that she should ask us about first. I can refuse to act on the cremation package, but even being signed up for it without our consent is pretty disrespectful and frankly weird.

My mother is adamant that she is just doing something nice for me and is trying to be considerate towards her grandson. I respond that if she wants to do something considerate, she should plan for his life, not his death. She should call us sometime to ask how the pregnancy is going, to talk about names, the nursery, baby plans, etc. She hasn't reached out once since we told her we were expecting. I ask my mom to please call us on occasion to talk about her life or our lives, but to please not make such weird and morbid decisions about our child's death before he is even born, and not without consulting us first.

My mom responds by saying that ""Well, your attitude about this makes me not want to call you!""

I respond by saying ""OK, Mom, I am going to hang up because you are being very, very cruel right now.""

I sent her a text after expressing my worry over her behavior and reminding her that I love her and want our son to know her, and that we would love to chat with her about our lives, her life, or her grandson when she is feeling up for it. 

AITA for my response? I'm frankly worried for her mental state a bit here, and am now wary of letting her spend time alone with the child once he is born. Since, after all, ""it's all taken care of!""

EDIT: Thank you all for your thoughts and opinions on this. I agree that she meant well by scoring this sweet deal, but how she handled it and then snapped at me for being upset by the situation is the problem. I took care of all the cremation stuff for my father’s death on my own years ago, so I’m well-versed in these issues. To those of you who have experienced loss of family or loved ones, you have my deepest sympathies and gratitude for sharing what wisdom can be borne from such tragedies.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for not telling off my daughter, even though she refuses to defend her ""pick me"" cousin from online attacks at school?"," My daughter, “Katie” (15F) is in the same school as her cousin “Olivia” (16F). 

Olivia isn’t the easiest girl to get on with. I think she struggles with insecurity, like many young people, and so she attempts to put others – particularly other girls – down. I know a lot of women undergo the phase, but Olivia is getting past the early teens stage where you just presume that she’ll grow out of it. I have on some occasions experienced similar with her mother, “Claire”, to be honest, so that might be where she gets it from. 

This is causing Olivia troubles at school. Their generation takes a lot less nonsense from that direction anyway, and her peers are growing into young women while she seems to remain immature. Another girl in their year had enough during a Zoom class and embarrassed Olivia (I actually overheard this) and since then a lot of ill will has come up towards her.

Yesterday I received a call from Olivia’s mother. The issue has escalated on social media, as things unfortunately tend to do now. Somebody Photoshopped Olivia’s face onto a picture of a Love Island contestant, who I gather is also unpopular for her attitude towards other women. I’m old and out of touch, so Katie struggled to explain the intricacies of the situation to me, but apparently there’s been a recent scandal which makes this celebrity an undesirable person to be associated with. In particular, she has a reputation for making herself the victim of situations, so whenever Olivia tries to defend herself, they just send another photo of the Love Island girl crying and it appears to reinforce their point. The Photoshopped image has been shared on various platforms amongst her classmates and generated further unkindness towards Olivia.

Seeing this, Olivia was obviously upset, and she messaged Katie asking her to defend her. Katie refused. She told Olivia that it was a self-fulfilling prophecy that all the other girls don’t like her and that she barely even knows the girls that are responsible for the meme. 

Claire wants me to tell Katie off, but I don’t think that that’s fair. I sympathise with my niece, I think the social media takes it up to a level that isn’t really acceptable, but that is for the school to sort out with the individuals, surely. Also - I do agree with Katie that it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, and it’s perhaps better that Olivia sees that now than have it affect her interactions with other women throughout her life. But it’s been weighing on me, and my mother recently phoned me to say that Claire is upset with me and that she also thinks I should speak to Katie.

AITA for telling you daughter she isn't my Whole world?,"I was a stay at home mom while my only child, ""Drina"" was growing up and because of that Drina got a lot of my undivided attention. Like most parents would do I put Drina's needs and wants before my own so she could grow. Because of the difficulties we had conceiving and carrying children I did have a tendency to sort of elevate Drina, made her feel special, because to me she was. Drina is well-mannered and smart and has a big heart but sometimes I think she lacks awareness. Because her needs were always front and center as a child she sometimes forgets that now that she's an adult it's not all about her anymore.

My husband worked a really good career that has left us in early 60s in a good position for retirement. I have a college degree but my having a career took a backseat to my daughter, which I was fine with. I have no complaints and I'm glad for the time I got to spend with Drina. Drina is in her late-20s now and married. She doesn't live with us but she and her husband have a condo nearby and we see each other often. They're thinking of starting a family soon.

My husband came home recently having bought a top of the line RV. We can afford this and it's something he's always wanted to do. He broached the idea of selling our house, which is too big for two people, and traveling. Right now, obviously, we're staying put, these are post-Covid plans, but we are going to do it. We're currently fixing the house up, trying to get the most out of eventually selling it.

We told Drina and her husband of our plans plans Drina became unexpectedly emotion and irrational. She we couldn't just leave her, she needed us, we can't sell her childhood home, when she has kids she thought I might be their daytime care-giver, said she is all we have how could we leave her.

I told her bluntly that I love her and she is always my baby, but She is only a big part of my world, not my whole world. I reminded her that I have a life and interests too and don't I deserve to enjoy the fruits of that life? Drina is educated, she has a career, home, someone to love, she's steady and stable, don't I get to enjoy having had a small part in that?

Anyway, Drina isn't speaking to us right now, said her feelings are hurt and that we don't care about her feelings.

AITA for refusing to let my sister and her young kids visit me?,"So I (24f) live in the Falkland Islands. I live in a house on a smaller island and am (usually) the only person for miles. I live on a beautiful island called 'Carcass Island'. Even Google doesn't know how many people are on Carcass Island (and neither do I).

My sister (28f), her husband (30m) and their 2 kids (both under 10) all want to visit me. I'd love them to, but I refuse to let anyone under 13 visit me for the sole reason that it is so isolating and mentally taxing. For some context, Carcass is 119 miles away from Stanley (which is where the shops and hospital are). If you get hurt, you're done for. I have TV and internet, but there's no park, no shops, no other kids to play with. It's cold constantly. The only way to get off the island is by boat that comes a few times a week. On top of that, the beaches have penguins and sea lions, and whilst it's fun to watch them, those animals are dangerous. Don't get me wrong, I love it here, but I would never risk young kids being stuck on this island with me. Hell, the island is called Carcass Island! It had to have gotten that name from somewhere!

When my sister brought up the idea, I immediately shut it down. I told her all my concerns, but she didn't seem that worried. She claimed her kids are good and that they all miss me. I told her no and that I'd be happy to pay for my own ticket to come visit them, but she said she wanted her kids to have the experience of visiting the islands. After some back and forth, my sister got increasingly more irritated with me and ended up snapping at me. She called me an asshole for not wanting to see my family and she 'uninvited' me from her son's bar mitzvah (which by the way, he's 10).. We ended the conversation on a bad note. A few hours later, her husband messaged me asking if I would reconsider. I also got a few texts from my brother telling me I was being dramatic and over-worried for no reason.

AITA?

EDIT: Thank you to everyone with helpful suggestions on how to prep my sister and her family if they decide to visit. I'll be asking if they want to compromise (stay in Stanley for the main bulk of their visit and visit my place for a few days).

EDIT 2: I just want to clarify- if I was in Stanley, my doors would be wide open. I might even insist they stayed for the summer. The issue is how far away the hospital is. 

A realistic issue would be in 10 got bit by a penguin and it turned into a deadly infection. What if the boat doesn't come back for another day? We've now got a very sick kid. The boat arrives, we travel through west Falklands, get on another boat, travel through east Falklands to the hospital. 119 miles. 

We could stay indoors the entire time, accidents still happen. 6 has Asperger's and is prone to dislocation. I'd rather play it safe in Stanley, then take a screaming 6 year old with a dislocated shoulder 119 miles. 

I don't hate kids, I don't hate my sister or BiL- I just don't want there to be a tragedy when it could be easily avoided.  ",Not the A-hole
AITA for getting upset about jokes about my 'nose job',"I had a septoplasty to resolve an issue with a bent septum and resultant bone spur.

It is a minor procedure, they just go up there and shave it a bit. I did not have a more complex one to completely straighten it.

I've accepted off the cuff jokes among friends about it being a nose job since it was in good jest, however it's been 3+ years now and I am well and truly over it.

Following a few months of polite but firm knock it offs, I had a bit of a argument about it - which devolved into both ""well it is a nose job"" and the etymology of -plasty.

I cannot seriously believe that anyone uses 'nose job' to shaving off a bone spur (and it's choice of words was clearly used as a reference to a rhinoplasty).

They think I'm being oversensitive/am a bit of an arsehole for making a big deal out a fairly unoffensive mild joke, but I think it's run it's course and I'm sick of a medical issue - albeit a minor one - still being made fun of.

AITA for getting mad at my wife for how she talked to my stepdad?,"So my mom kind of sucks and tried to wear white to our wedding, 100% out of spite. She doesn't even like white. My stepdad seems to like her crazy most of the time, but is much more reasonable. She always says she knows she is an asshole and she married him because he gives it back to her, so I think she got exactly what she deserved. He agreed to help us, and gave her a gift before the wedding, a glitter bomb.

I think he is a hero, and saved a lot of drama at the wedding. Even my mom laughed and he told her he packed her another dress. I mean I think she kind of deserved something hideous, bu he is her husband and he loves her, so he picked out something nice. The wedding went off without a hitch and my mom even smiled in the pictures (this woman has resting bitch face to the 900th degree) He did us a solid and even got the glorious moment where she got covered in glitter on camera.

Anyway we saw him for the first time since the wedding and my wife asked if he bought my mom such a sexy dress on purpose. He made a joke about well I am a man, so kind of. She didn't think it was funny and said the dress he bought was worse than the white, because at least my mom doesn't look great in white, but the gown he bought her was too extravagant, and too sexy for the mother of the groom. He kind of laughed it off and said that his wife is gorgeous and deserves to look it. She called him an asshole.

I got mad at her when he left, because he is a genuinely nice guy, maybe a bit clueless about wedding fashion. She said he did it on purpose and I told her that she is being paranoid.

AITA for buying a kitten?,"My boyfriend and I are in our early 20’s and we bought our first home using my inheritance from grandparents and money gifted by his parents. It’s a small fixer upper home and we’ve just finished renovating it. 
For context I am in grad school and my boyfriend earns a decent wage. My parents give me a small amount of money each month for food as I have to pay for my tuition. 
We have now finished paying for home renovations and we decided we could finally afford to get ourselves a kitten (and pay the insurance, food etc). 

Tonight we excitedly FaceTimed my parents to show him to my family and they (especially my mom) shouted at us, saying we are irresponsible and the small amount of money they give us is not to be spent on a cat. They said they were disappointed that we are tying ourselves down for the next 20 years. It ended up with us both crying as it was not the reaction we expected and my sister telling them what we did was not their business to make a judgement. 

My dad sent a follow up text apologising for his outburst and said it was a shock. He said he understood that we had talked about this for when we owned our own place and he was happy I was happy but was surprised there was no prior mention. My mom (who doesn’t work) said they will never give us money again as she didn’t realise they were paying for a cat (They’re not, my boyfriend is with the money he earns). 
I said that I didn’t realise the allowance they gave us was conditional, and that they can either accept all 3 of us or not. We love our new little kitty and he’s already everything we’ve wanted.

WIBTAH if I throw away towels my MIL gave us?,"Tl:dr; MIL is...a helicopter parent and is also a terrible gift giver. Asking if I’d be the AH for throwing away towels we didn’t need in the first place, and are now falling apart at the seams after three or four washes and leaving mountains and mountains of lint piles on the lint catch of our dryer. 

On to the story. If you’re here this far, bless you.

My MIL gave ordered some really cheap towels for Christmas as part of our housewarming gifts. My Wife and I just moved in to our new place. 

The towels leave a lot of lint balls when you use them to dry off, and in the dryer, I have been pulling out mounds and mounds of lint from the lint catch. Now, after having washed them at least twice since receiving them, they are fraying at the edges and the stitching is falling apart. 

Would I be the AH if I just...toss them? We already had a nice supply of towels and we’re not currently having people stay over or come visit, so it’s not like we would need extra for any guests. Getting more towels is not a priority at the moment and probably won’t be for a while. We need things like a dining room table and chairs lol. Or a dresser/bureau so we have a proper place to put our underwear. 

I feel terrible because I have a narcissistic parent and have been taught to be grateful for any and every gift I receive, and to hoard everything that has ever been given to me. 

I think I might be the AH if I just toss these towels, because eventually my MiL will visit and she will be looking around to see if we are even using the towels she sent to us and I don’t want to break her heart and be like “hey well, they were kinda terrible and clogging my dryer with lint so I tossed them”.

ETA: I have been talking/complaining to my wife about it and we seem to be on the same page about tossing them. However, we also feel that we don’t want to hurt her mother’s feelings when she comes to visit and sees we’re not using the towels. Help!

AITA? Told my boyfriend I don’t want to game when he’s watching.,"Ugh, this is a mess, but stick with me.
I (24/F) like to game. Sadly I am also a medical student, and with COVID and all I have had very little time this past year. This Christmas my lovely mother got me Assassins Creed: Valhalla(for PS4), and I’ve been playing it when I have found the time. I’m rusty, and because it may be a while between my gaming sessions it takes some time for me to get the hang of the controls again. It sucks but it is what it is.
This is where my boyfriend(26/M) comes into the picture. He’s working as a personal trainer so naturally work has been short for him. But he is also a HUGE gamer. So much he has in fact started competing and earning money through it. Super happy for him. He plays some of the games I play as well, though we favour different genres.
The problem arises when we are together and I’m playing. I get it can be frustrating to watch me play, because I’m not as skilled as he, but he constantly criticise me. And the “good advice” that is totally unsolicited, when I’m actually just trying to enjoy myself. Even at times asking if I want help clearing a wave or getting past a checkpoint. I asked him to please stop, but he always falls back into it.
It has resulted in me not really enjoying the experience that much and me becoming quite self-conscious about my abilities in gaming. 
A few days back I told him I didn’t want to play when he’s there anymore. “It makes me uncomfortable that you keep interfering and it takes the joy out of the game for me” was what I told him. I wasn’t mad, I wasn’t sad, I just made a decision. He was seemingly fine with it... until yesterday. He was so sad, and kept telling me he was so sorry for making me feel uncomfortable in my hobby, he didn’t mean to, etc. I knew this of course, he probably just thought he was being helpful. 
But it doesn’t change the fact that I feel judged when he’s watching me play, and I want to just be able to enjoy it.
To begin with I kind of thought his reacting was a bit much, but if he’s this affected by it I’m starting to wonder if I was actually hurtful in what I did. I know it’s not really that big an issue but it’s been looming uncomfortably over us for hours now.

WIBTA for kicking out my bestfriend and his girl friend,"Last year I (32M) let my best friend of 20 years (31m) move into my apartment with his (22f) girlfriend. Before I start with the scenario, here's a bit of understanding of me.

I am very low profile, I generally keep to myself and maintain a clean home. Dishes don't stay in the sink overnight, if food is dumped in the trash; it's taken out.  I'm also the single bachelor in my circle of friends and I do have some lady friends that I invite over but they most don't get to stay overnight. Keep in mind, I'm a bit of a functional stoner and everyone is aware of this.

So buddy tells me his plight April 2020 (laid off due to covid), his gf doesn't work and he didn't know how he was going to be able to afford rent. We agreed on the following stipulation...
1. After the first 2 months, $200 rent (it was $150) to add an additional person, I was ""friends"" with the property manager, so we didn't pay for 2 ppl.
2. Avg bill for utilities 50 (I showed proof), they were responsible for any overage.
3. No additional internet costs. No food in the rooms. No overnight dirty dishes. We rotated bathroom cleaning weekly.
4. No laundry done past 8pm and Thurs/fri the machines were mine.
5. I had no responsibility to their dog and they were responsible for any damage. My dog is properly trained, their is an asshole.

The problems... their dog constantly shits in the house because the gf doesn't get outta bed to walk him. Rent lately has been coming in late and the utilities have been skyrocketing, so far it's gotten as high as $140 (I use a space heater, I advised that to them and they still use the Ac heater). The gf became best friends with the across the hall neighbor, the bitch has been stealing my weed and she always had a crush on me, and I'm 95% sure she stole one my hoodies outta the coat closet. But worst of all it's the constant fighting between them. The walls are not thin so for me to hear them through the walls is a problem. The gf has voiced complaints about my female companions (she feels its disrespectful to her despite us not being heard), thinks its unfair that they have to pay the overage. My home used to be a sweet escape and now I absolutely hate. They went on a trip and after I said explicitly that I would not be taking responsibility of their dog, they left without him (obviously I'm not cruel) I took care of him. My apartment smells like dog and disaster. This is my best friend so I've let shit go for awhile but I'm at my wit's end.

Update: Will talk to him tonight when I get home from work. Some of you are wondering why I put up with this. When I was 19, we sorta dropped out of college but I was sick and had to undergo radiation therapy and his mom took me in that year. They treat me like family. However, I definitely didn't take advantage.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my coworker to mind her own business or I will report her to HR?,"I (27F) have been obese for majority of my life. My highest weight was 92kg and I am 164cm. My parents tried to instill good habits in my childhood but I got addicted to junk food in my teenage years. It was a big struggle to lose weight since. Last year I finally managed to get my eating habits under control. I eat one meal a day (OMAD) but it is a big meal that is satisfying and balanced. Usually I have rice with a side of vegetables, eggs and one type of meat. Sometimes if I feel like it I will also have an avocado shake or some fruits. I fast for the rest of the day. There are other reasons why I follow this diet. I have terrible acid reflux that makes me nauseous if I eat anything in the morning and at night. Keeping my meals to the afternoon period (1-4pm) has helped me to control this. Before this the nausea would get so bad that I would have to get off the bus to vomit on the way to work. Haven’t had this issue since I started this diet. I reached my goal weight and have been maintaining this diet since. 
	

For some reason my diet immensely bothers my co worker, Rachel. She always has something to say about my food. Some of the things she said: it looks boring, doesn’t it get boring to eat the same thing everyday?, I feel sad looking at your diet, a donut isn’t going to hurt your weight loss etc. We only worked in office until April 2020 before lock down started. After April we were working from home so I didn’t have to deal with her comments anymore. We have not stepped foot into office until this year January. Many of my co workers were shocked at my transformation. Rachel has started her nonsense comments again saying my diet is unhealthy, restrictive and that I am “too thin”. I have told her multiple times to stop commenting on my food and body as it is not appropriate, but it seems like she cannot stop herself from saying something. I have even changed my lunch hours so that I don’t have to eat lunch around her. 


Yesterday I snapped as she was purposely talking very loud about me to another co worker, talking about how I have disordered eating and am “too thin”. It seems as if she wanted me and the rest of the office to hear. I walked over and said very loudly that she needs to mind her own business and that if she doesn’t stop with her comments on my weight or diet that I will go straight to HR. Her face changed and you could hear a pin drop in the office. Majority of my co workers support me. However, there are 2 other people that have come forward saying they think I am too thin and they were concerned and that I was too harsh on Rachel. I told them that I will also report them to HR if they don’t mind their own business. For the record my weight is in the healthy BMI range. I haven’t heard a thing from Rachel today. When I told my mom she thinks I massively overreacted and that they are still getting used to the thinner me. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for “showing off my intelligence”?,"This happened today and I’m still furious about it. I (16F) do generally well in school. I’m in the top 5% of my class and take mostly AP and honors classes. My parents do not really care that I do well in school. They pay attention and invest their energy into my brother who is really talented, athletic and play a myriad of high school sports. He was being scouted by colleges and they expect him to play professionally. I’m not jealous of my brother and do not look down on him. Him and I get along well and I just think we are both talented in our own ways. Our extended family fawns over him and his athleticism is normally the bragging point for our parents. My maternal uncle doesn’t, he went to a top tier school and go out of his way to make me feel special too. He will often buy me books and discuss them with me mostly via email or texts. He called my mom on facetime and after exchanging pleasantries with the rest of the family ( we were all in the living room), him and I started taking about a book he recently bought for me. It is an autobiography that centered around morality and economic redistribution. We discussed the main themes for about 15 minutes then my mom said she wanted to speak to my uncle privately. I told my uncle that I’d text him as we normally do, to discuss further. After the call, my mom said it was rude of me to discuss the book with my uncle especially In their presence. She said I was trying to show off my intelligence to make my brother feel bad. I was not. It turned into a heated argument and I pointed out that they clearly favor my brother which is why my uncle is the only person who seem to care about my education. I am now grounded (idc, it’s not like I was able to go out anyways. ) My dad wants me to apologize because I was disrespectful. I don’t think I should and will  rather stay grounded.",Not the A-hole
AITA for getting my boyfriend's mom to tell him to stop crossdressing in public?,"I (23M) have social anxiety. It's hard for me to go out in public at all because I always feel like people are staring at me. My boyfriend (22M) has been a big supporter of mine and has helped me get to a point where I don't do that as much, but I'm still not perfect. I won't talk if it's quiet and there are people nearby. Our area is pretty conservative, I don't really feel comfortable being in a gay relationship in public, so we also can't hold hands/do any kind of PDA.

My boyfriend collects vintage clothes. He buys women's and men's, but the kind of men's he likes are hard to find and usually pretty expensive. This quarantine, he decided to get some use out of the women's clothes and started wearing them around the house. This wasn't a problem for me.

The problem is, he won't change when we go on walks. Sometimes, I think he can pass as a girl, but sometimes he'll go out in a full men's outfit except a poodle skirt with obviously hairy legs underneath. He's only been harassed about it once so far, but that one time I had a panic attack and got lost, meaning I couldn't even help him.

I've stopped going out with him on days he's wearing traditional women's clothes (although there aren't many). I don't even like him going out alone like that, knowing he can get harassed. When I tell him about how I feel, says he thinks it's not a big deal and it's ""his life.""

Anyway, I was talking to his mom and I mentioned it to her, and she called him to know if he's trans (he's not) and then started begging him not to do it because she's worried about him getting harassed again. Now that he's faced with giving his mom a heart attack, he's stopped, but he's upset at me for getting his mom involved. I honestly was just telling her I was worried because I think about it all the time. I didn't think she would actually do anything. AITA?

EDIT: I can't change it in the title, but I changed crossdressing to ""wearing traditional women's clothes"" in the post. Sorry if I offended anybody, I didn't know it was an offensive term.

EDIT: Everything's good now. We talked it out. This was our first couple's argument since high school, so I'm actually pretty happy for us! If anybody else is going to comment, can we try to stay away from overly mean or personal insults? Thanks. :)",Asshole
AITA for accepting a car against my brother's wishes?,"So, as a quick background, my step-grandfather (SG) is dying. As in, likely to die in the coming weeks. It has all been very sudden, and I've taken it quite hard. Also, to clarify, he is not biologically related to any of my family, but married my nan when I was very young. 

My brother (20m) has never been that involved in family stuff. He mostly always declines to visit them because they live 6 hours away, and kind of stays around enough to show his face and then slinks off. On the other hand, I (23f) always take the opportunity to visit if my mum is driving up, am interested in learning about their culture, and regularly write them letters because they don't have Internet (To put in context the following decision).

Recently, my mum let me know that he had made the decision to gift his car to me. I was so grateful! I've been looking at buying a car, and was even suggesting buying his car. However, since making this decision, he has refused to accept money for it. It will be worth no more than 1k , and needs some work on it before it can be used, but yeah. I didn't think that much of it since then. My brother doesn't have a license and has never showed any interest in getting it. 

Now here is the problem. We had a family zoom yesterday, and my mum shared the news that I had been gifted the car. My brother's tone kinda changed, and he sarcastically said 'thats not very fair', and then didn't speak for much of the call, which has been making me feel guilty ever since. 

I feel entitled to some extent to this car, because I'm the only grandchild who tries to keep in contact, and it is essentially a dying man's wish. However, I do feel bad for my brother. To some extent, it's playing favourites, and he is also unlikely to receive anything close to the value of the car in the will, since my grandparents are quite poor and my nan will inherit most of it. 

I thought about 'splitting' the car to spare the tension, but I only want to do this because I feel bad, since he obviously has no practical use for it. We also don't live together, as he splits his time between college and our parents', while I live away. 

So, reddit, AITA for accepting the car?",Not the A-hole
AITA for continuing to wear a bracelet an ex gave me?,"Title sounds petty but let me explain. My dad’s side of the family is Brazilian but always excluded me for looking completely white. They accused my mom of cheating, never involved me in the culture, I never learned portugese. When I was a sophomore in high school (yeah, quite a while ago) I was dating a guy, let’s call him Peter, who visited Brazil with his family and brought me back a bracelet. It’s a leather band with hand-inked patterns and tied with a little string and carved wooden bead. It’s simple and beautiful. Obviously it was high school so the relationship didn’t last long blah blah blah I haven’t seen him or heard from him in years. I’ve kept the bracelet and I wear it daily as some tie to my heritage. I’m now dating a girl, “Jemma,” who is super offended I wear it for some reason. She keeps telling me I have an unhealthy attachment to Peter and that I need to get rid of the bracelet to “truly let him go.” We didn’t end on bad terms, it just didn’t work out and we mutually decided to split up. I genuinely don’t think about him and the bracelet doesn’t represent him in my mind. It represents my family. 

Now here’s where I might have been the AH. Jemma was trying to start another argument about the bracelet, she said she couldn’t believe I was being so petty as to keep wearing it even though I knew it made her uncomfortable. I didn’t know what to say, she kept going on about it and cutting me off whenever I tried to get a word in about how I don’t wear it because he gave it to me or because it reminds me of my family. She eventually held her hand out and told me to give it to her, that she’d get rid of it for me since I’m obviously not brave enough. I just left. Grabbed my bag, walked out of the apartment, drove to my brother’s. I’ve been getting texts and calls from her, her friends, her mom, asking how could I be so dramatic and willing to “ruin our relationship” over something so small as a bracelet. I’m thinking maybe I should just get rid of it to please her.

Edit: I’m going to ask her to meet me at the park tomorrow with our dog and we’ll talk. I’m leaving the bracelet at my brother’s, though I hope she wouldn’t do anything rash anyways once she’s calmed down.",Not the A-hole
AITA asking my friend to use the generic guest profile on my Netflix?,"I really think this is ridiculous and absurd which is why I’m here. I 37(F) have a friend who lives frugally. I don’t judge her choices because I think being frugal is better than being a spendthrift. We make around the same salary, we are both married. She has a toddler, I have a three year old and two tweens. About a year or so ago, I made a reference to a scene from one of my favorite tv shows on Netflix (black mirror). She said the show sounded interesting and she wanted to watch it. She asked for my Netflix password and I gave it to her and told her that there’s a generic guest profile for her to use (My husband created this profile for his younger brother to use). My husband and I share a profile. The twins each have their own profiles and the toddler use the kids profile with the parental controls. 

The twins have been arguing and accusing each other of messing up their algorithms. I looked at the watch history and noticed a lot of true crime and horror shows and movies. I noticed the same in our profile and husband confirmed he hasn’t watched those. I suspected My friend has been watching them. I casually brought it up with her and explained that it’s causing a lot of conflict between the twins. She chuckled and said that she has been choosing random profiles to watch her shows instead of the guest profile. She added that I should create a profile for her and the twins need to learn how to share. I disagreed and told her to please stick to the guest profile. She didn’t listen. So I changed the Netflix password. She called me an asshole and accused me of not knowing how to share. She said the twins have learned their selfish behavior from me. I’m really pissed and really want to cut her off completely.",Not the A-hole
AITA For Fact Checking My Wife?,"So, I don't believe I'm the asshole but I've been told sometimes I think too much with my head and not enough with my heart so I'm not 100% sure. 

This kind of thing has happened before in our relationship and it always boils down to my wife wanting me to ""trust her"" and I do trust her, but I'm a logical person and I don't see anything wrong with fact checking. I think everyone should fact check any information regardless of the source. 

So last night we are at my in law's house. My wife and her mother were discussing sumo oranges and my wife mentioned that she read they are so expensive because it takes them 4 years to ripen on the tree. I was like ""4 years on the tree? That's crazy are you sure?"" and as I finish I pull out my phone and she says ""he's going to look it up, he doesn't believe me"" and I'm like ""yeah it just seems crazy I think maybe you misread something"" and a few minutes later I confirm that no it doesn't take the fruit 4 years to ripen it takes the tree 4 years and a lot of work before it will produce any fruit at all, to which I relay this information to her. She then gets really quiet and I ask her if she's mad that I didn't believe her and looked it up and she confirms it but says she doesn't want to talk about it. 

Now, you may say I'm the asshole for purposely embarrassing her in front of her mom but that wasn't my intention and this kind of thing has happened before even when we're alone, she gets upset that I didn't blind trust her info and believes I should just believe it. However if I were wrong I would want to be told, who wants to go around relaying bad info when someone could help you out and give you the right info. I don't have an ""I told you so"" attitude or act like I'm smarter I just look it up and say ""oh no actually it looks like it's XYZ and not ABC"". But maybe I'm wrong and I should just shut up and not correct her. So reddit, AITA? 

Also, full disclosure we did have a fight earlier that day and I was upset with her about something unrelated so I am sure that played into her irritation, but again this type of thing has happened before and I've been told by my wife that I should just trust her / believe her.

Edit: The consensus so far seems to be that I’m an asshole and I can accept that. One thing I didn’t fully explain though, I wasn’t going to say anything at the time. I pulled out my phone to check out of curiosity, but then she called me out on looking it up and basically asked for what it said and then I relayed the information. She was confident she was correct and believe me or not I took no pleasure in correcting her, it’s as if she said “it’s going to rain today and I checked and said oh no looks like it’s blue skies you won’t need that umbrella”. 

The thing that bothers her the most isn’t me correcting her but not accepting the information as is instead of verifying it.",Asshole
AITA for telling my husband that he is lazy and that he needs to do more chores around the house?,"My husband and I have been married for just about a year now.  We dated for several years beforehand.  We had not lived together before we were married.  After getting married, it didn't take long for me to notice that he was pretty lazy around the house.  He is not a stay at home dad, so he is not around the house all day and he is not expected to do all of the chores.  But he does not have some high stress job and he works many less hours than me.  He works as a cashier at a local store.  He works maybe 2-3 days a week for around 6-8 hours each of those days.  Now I don't want to sound like I think so highly of myself, but the fact is that I have a pretty high paying job.  The truth is that he doesn't really need a job, but I'm not going to tell him to quit if it makes him happy and is something he wants.  

The issue is that I work way more than him and still do way more of the work around the house.  Literally the only thing he does is sweep.  He can be messy too so I have to pick up from him a lot as well.  The other day, I decided it was time to finally sit him down and have a long serious discussion about it.  I told him, ""I'm going to need you to stop being so lazy and help me out around here more.  I have a very high-stress job and I just can't be doing everything around the house.""  He got mad and said that he wasn't lazy.  He said that it's not like he is a stay at home dad, so he shouldn't be expected to do the chores.  I told him that he works way less hours than me so therefore he should take up more of the chores.  He got very upset and acted like I was saying that his job sucked.  

It wasn't my intentions to hurt him like that or embarrass him.  He hasn't spoken to me since then.  Was I the asshole for what I did?",Not the A-hole
AITA for calling my friend ableist?,"Backstory: I, 17f, had weakness and some numbness in my legs from when I was about 9, it doesn't appear to be a spinal issue as I still have full bladder control and the issue kind of stops around my upper thigh/hip area. I lost all sensation in my legs and an awful lot of movement as a result just under two years ago. I can walk aided for very short distances, I'm an ambulatory wheelchair user. My doctors don't know what caused it but assume it was some form of illness that ate away at muscles and nerves, and no form of physical therapy or any other treatment has done anything. I still do PT 7 days a week.

Yesterday, my 2 (16m and 17f) friends and I went to grab coffee and st/roll around the park for a bit. I'm not sure how my disability came up in conversation. F is as understanding as she can be about the situation and is aware that not much can be done to fix it, M is a bit more uneducated. He started asking me if I had tried certain homeopathic methods and when I said that it mightnt be a good idea but I do get acupuncture every few months for stress relief, he said that maybe I'm not trying hard enough to walk for more time to build up muscle in my leg. I explained to him that while muscle is a good thing, I can't feel my legs and that could potentially be dangerous as I could trip on a small child or a dog or catch my leg on something and not notice an injury for hours. After that he accused me of just being lazy and looking for excuses.

I tried my best to stay calm, and asked him to change the topic but he wouldn't. He kept saying stuff about how I need to try harder and that I need to stop looking for excuses. I eventually said to him, ""Look, M, stop being so fucking ableist and keep your nose out of my business. You're not my doctor"".

He's really upset, saying that he's just looking out for me and that he didn't know what he was saying was wrong. F says I might've been a bit harsh on him and that he didn't realise he was hurting my feelings. Our other friends are torn between my side and his. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to meet my in-laws despite my wife begging me to?," throwaway just in case I am the asshole

My wife(25f) and I(31m) have been together for 5 years and have two children(5m,3m). Before I got together with my wife, I was married to my wife’s cousin(30f), until we got divorced 6 years ago when she found out I had an affair with her cousin(current wife). Eventually, my in-laws heard what happened, and my current wife was in all but name disowned by her family. I and my wife got married shortly after the divorce was finalized when we found out she was pregnant(we were having unprotected sex for a while). Obviously, I was the asshole in that situation, but in my defense, I was young and selfish,  in addition, that was a long time ago. For the past few months, my wife has been trying to get back in contact with her parents(them disowning her affected her greatly) and she eventually convinced them to start talking to her again. A few days ago my wife and I went on a zoom meeting with her parents, and sadly they still hate me(it seems like they only got into contact with my wife to meet their grandchildren tbh). This morning my wife told me that she organized a lunch between her and my in-laws, and asked if I wanted to go. I would have maybe gone until I heard that my ex-wife’s dad was going to be there, so I told her no. My wife has been begging me to come with her this whole day, but I am standing my ground. Eventually, I called my sister asking for advice, she told me to stop being a “selfish asshole” and to  “grow up” and face the “consequences of my actions”. I do slightly understand where my sister is coming from, but my wife’s parents made it very clear they still hate me on the zoom meeting, I can’t imagine that meeting them and my former FIL(who seems to despise me even more than my wife’s parents based on what I heard) will work out well for me or my wife.

AITA For not letting my son into my house after he tried to sell it to pay for his mom's surgery?,"My husband (deceased) and I adopted our son since he was 2. We gave him a beautiful name. Moved into a new house with spacious backyard. We were happy to have him in our lives. We were open with him about his past. At 4 we told him that he was adopted. We took care of everything, But at 16 he started behaving strangely. We thought he was just being a teenager. But he treated me and his father poorly blaming us for taking him from his real mother. He said that all the time. He distanced himself from me and stopped calling me mom. That broke my heart it's been years. He also changed his name saying he wanted to have a say. And that I had no right to give him his old name just because he was adopted. He'd argue with us for no reason telling us we had no business in knowing anything about him because he isn't our son. I had no idea why he acted like that. We were always there for him.

We Paid for his college and he left at 19 saying he wanted to go to his real family and cut contact. My husband and I tried to text, call, his dad passed away last year. He Didn't even visit me. I was dealing with grief. This was my first Christmas without my husband
I tried to reach out but was at a loss since he wouldn't talk, text or see me. My family told me to let him go for now, that he'll come around eventually but my heart was crying just to speak with him or see him.

He met some of his birth family but had no connection to them. He couldn’t develop a relationship with his aunts or uncles because of how they treated his mother
He never got invited to cookouts or parties . He decided to stick with his biological mom who's dealing with a medical condition. He visited me a month ago and told me all of that. He talked about his mother's illness and asked me to help. I was taken aback after he told me he came back because he wanted to and then suggested that I sell my house to help pay for his mother's surgery. Suggested that I live in an apartment instead. I was shocked I told him no. This is not my problem and this house is all I have left. He argued with me said hurtful things like how I'm refusing to help out of spite and that I wanted his mom out of the picture.

He Said that I can't keep him away from his mother. And I'm not keeping him away. But he was out of line to tell me to sell my house and help him out. I eventually kicked him out after he hid documents that belonged to the house to try and get me to sell it. I haven't heard from him until last week. My family contacted me saying my son wants to see me I refused to let him into my house. I argued with my family when they berated me for treating him like that. I explained what happened and they said that I should consider helping him if I want a relationship with him since he came back. I refused to help especially after how he acted.

WIBTA if I smoke my MIL out of my condo?,"My (36m) first child is 9 weeks old and my MIL has been staying in our 2 BR condo for all 9 of those weeks. 

The problem is MIL isn’t helping with my son. She sleeps from 10pm-7am, lays in bed reading for 2 hours then starts a 2+ hour bath/morning routine. When she finally emerges into the fray around noon, she spends all of her time on loud WhatsApp conversations with her home country people in their native language about a house she’s trying to build over there. I work full time, do all of the cooking, cleaning, laundry, shopping, and changing of the baby (MIL has a shoulder injury precluding the use of one of her arms). Since she doesn’t help during the day, I do the 2am and 5am feedings so my wife (33f) can get sleep, then watch him from 7-9am so my wife can shower and eat.

My wife has always had a toxic, r/raisedbynarcissist relationship with her and doesn’t realize that she’s being exploited yet again, but that’s a story for another day and another sub. Right now I need to get my MIL the hell out of my house. WIBTA if I “smoked” her out by sabotaging her phone? I’m pretty sure dunking it in water while she’s asleep or breaking the SIM card would do it (open to suggestions if anyone has any btw.) She’s disrespecting me and my wife and son and needs to go, and the only reason my wife doesn’t see it the same way is because of a lifetime of her mother’s abuse and manipulation

EDIT: Yes I’ve already had a direct conversation with my MIL and wife. My MIL says she’d do more but can’t because of her shoulder.  My wife takes her side and agrees, saying her presence alone is emotional support (and again, she is being manipulated).

The logic behind breaking the phone is that MIL can’t drive or travel alone and is tech illiterate and barely speaks English, so to fix it her child who pays for her phone would have to come pick her up and take her back home to do it. Also it’s all she truly enjoys doing, so if she couldn’t talk on her phone she’d likely rather not be here anyway",Asshole
AITA for asking my brother to pay me back money I loaned him 2 years ago?,"Two years ago my(33m) brother (27m) was going through a rough time. He was getting a divorce, going through a custody battle, filed for bankruptcy, and had to move in back with our parents. He needed money for legal fees and borrowed money from a few family members. I loaned him $1,000 and told him not to worry about it until he got back on his feet. This was an amount I could afford not getting back for awhile, but more than I could afford to just give him.

Fast forward two years. He now rents a house from our Uncle which he lives and shares costs with another family member. He pays about $350/mo total for rent and utilities. He recently went on a couple vacations, bought a new iphone, and always has new shoes and/or clothes when I see him. He has paid back all of the other family members. I asked him about 3 months ago if he could pay me back any because I had an emergency repair at my house and was short about $1,000 to fix it. He sent me $200. 

A couple weeks ago, I asked him if he could start paying the remainder of the money back. I don't really need the money, but I don't think he would ever pay it back if I didn't ask. He said yes, but now I haven't heard from him and he stopped participating in our family group text, which is unusual for him.

AITA for not making my family meals as they aren't helping me with childcare?,"The layout of my family's house is that there's the main house and then there's a ""studio"", which is a small, separate building a little bit away from the house, with a bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom. Technically I (20f) own the studio but we consider it part of the house.

From the age of 18 I was paying £200 per month in rent on my childhood bedroom in the main house. I was also helping with housework and doing all the cooking from age 15, so we agreed I should continue this. I felt this was fair as the rent on a flat share in my area is £500+. I took on the cooking as mum is unable to cook for a medical reason, (step)dad works long hours so he can't, and my younger siblings are all under 13. I have an older sibling, but he can't help out with dinner.

When I got pregnant my family said I could continue to live with them and they would help out with childcare, enabling me to continue working (25-30hr/week) and attending classes, but I had to move into the studio. I was not thrilled with this, but I sucked it up and moved in. While pregnant, I continued spending most of my time in the main house as I still did my chores, and while I was there I also prepped some meals to store in the massive freezer in the studio.

I had my baby 3 months ago, and I've been in the studio for about 6 months now. Just before my son was born, my parents upped the rent to £400 in addition to the housework, due to the increase in bills with me using the studio. I agreed, as I still thought they'd be helping me out with childcare.

However, when my son was born, they told me that they couldn't help me. I then arranged childcare during my working hours. However, from about 5pm-9am daily, I am entirely on my own regarding taking care of my son. Because of this, I haven't been doing the chores I normally do in the main house, and my family have ended up getting takeaways, ready meals, and pre prepared frozen meals most days, while I make my own food when I can in the studio, or used my prepped meals.

My family have are upset with this new development, and want me to resume my chores, particularly cooking, or at least give them a few of my prepped meals. I've responded that I can't do that *and* take care of a baby *and* work and that if one of them wants to watch the baby long enough for me to put together a meal and do some laundry then I will, but I can't watch my baby and cook.

They say that I'm punishing my siblings more than anyone and that I'm being a total arsehole. I've said that they're the ones who are being unreasonable and that if they want my help they need to help me first.

AITA for thinking that eggs are vegan when they're actually not and potentially ruining our business?,"Me and my brother have always worked together but last year we stopped being landscape gardeners and pivoted to being personal trainers/influencers. My brother has been a vegan for over 15 years and he thought it would be a profitable market to tap into. He has taken the lead and I've just been happy to tag along and provide the banter and good looks, lol.

The other week he became unwell so he instructed me to take over the socials- show some meal prep, do some motivational talks, show some exercises, etc. This was going great and the reaction was pretty good and the metrics were up as I understand them.

However, when doing one of the meal prep videos I added two eggs to my smoothie as I've always done and this sparked quite a bit of backlash. I honestly thought that because eggs aren't alive that they were vegan. I've since learnt this isn't true and tried to apologise but a lot of people feel very upset and that it totally invalidates all our hype around vegan gains.

My brother has gone absolutely mad and said I've ruined this just like I always do(?!) and has since locked me out of all the accounts and changed the names of everything to remove 'brothers' and indicate it's just his business now. He isn't answering my calls or messages asking what I'm supposed to do for money now.

AITA Am I (23F) the asshole because I won't cosign a mortgage for my parents?,"I (23F) graduated college last year and have been working full time since then. Because of the pandemic and the fact that my dad has recently become disabled I have moved back in with my parents to help my mom out. I normally live in another city and plan on moving back mid-2021. 

My parents want to move to the city where I live and they want me to cosign a mortgage with them because they said that they couldn't get a mortgage because my dad has no salary income anymore. They want all of us to live with each other, or if I wanted to live with my friend I could live there but I would still need to cosign the mortgage because I have a proof of income. I don't want to make this financial commitment. I'm afraid my debt to income ratio (I make less than 60k) will be too large and I want to go back to school soon for a master's degree and I'm not sure I could get a loan if I had a mortgage. I also don't have a lot of financial knowledge or experience, and my parents say that I should trust them and that this will be good for my credit and future. I know they would make payments, but I really don't want to make this financial commitment, especially with family and I think they could still get a mortgage--theyre just taking the 'easier' and more emotional option. They think I'm abandoning them in their time of need and that I'm being an ungrateful daughter. They are financially independent and own a house already (which they would sell), they are just worried for their future because my dad won't have steady income via a salary anymore and are convinced a bank won't give a mortgage to them.

Am I the asshole because I won't cosign a mortgage for my parents?

AITA for living with my girlfriend when she used to be bigoted?,"Hi! I (22M) am bisexual. Most of my friends thought I was gay. My girlfriend, who I've now been seeing for three years, comes from a very conservative political family. They were very actively against LGBT people, until that became mostly socially unacceptable, and now they're only slightly outwardly homophobic.

My girlfriend herself used to be pretty conservative because of her parents. She was kind of shown off as a kid politician when she was very young, and they used her as a bit of a posterchild for some homophobic *don't let them near our kids*\-stuff. It's not well known, but the videos are pretty embarrassing. She stayed that way until her teens, and then we met and now she couldn't be farther from how she was as a kid, although she's still pretty traditional about some things. For example, even though we live together, she's waiting until marriage--a bit strange, but not hateful at all.

Anyway, I want to marry her. I love her so much. I was having a Zoom call with my mates, and we were all talking about how we can't wait to see each other once the plague is over and how we're going to be able to actually go inside each other's houses (*gasp!*) and one of them said ""well, everybody's besides (mine),"" and they started laughing. I asked why and they said it's because I'm living with Mike Pence (we're not even American).

 I tried to explain her situation, and everything got really serious and one of them said that doesn't mean they have to feel safe around her or forgive her. They said it's kind of disturbing that I would live with her, and it's like turning my back on the LGBT+ community.

I pointed out my last boyfriend treated me horribly and they were all over him, but they said the situation was completely different. Is it wrong for me to live with my girlfriend when it makes my friends feel unsafe? Does it make me homophobic? I'm so confused right now. I obviously still want to marry her and it hasn't changed our relationship, but I would like to know AITA?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I told my friend to stop calling me every night when I've already said I'm studying or busy?,"We're all in university and this semester is already hard enough that I barely sleep. She calls our friends and I every fucking night. This started about 2 years ago. At first it was whatever cause we would talk for a bit and hang up and it was during the evenings or till about 11PM. NOW she calls us and ends up going to sleep around 1 while she engages the rest of us in a conversation. Last semester I started saying I was busy and then she would use excuses which would make me feel bad and call her. 

This time before the start of the semester, one of my friends and I already told her we can't talk till late because we're going to be busy. She said ""you guys are gonna stay up late anyway"" WELL WE'RE DOING WORK OF COURSE WE ARE. 

I'm so tired of this and annoyed to say the least. If I don't pick up she constantly calls on us social media apps and then gives attitude if we call back.

AITA for taking back my dog that my father and brother gave to their neighbour?,"First time poster so please bear with me plus I’m on mobile so sorry for that 

My brother took one of my 3 dogs (Patty) with him when he moved without telling me while I was at uni. I came home and she was missing so I searched the streets, called all the local vets until I called Mum crying saying she was lost. She sent my brother a text asking if he took her since he had to go past my place to move to dads, he had.

Since Patty was “given” to my brother when we got her I felt that I had to suck it up and let him have her even though she really was mine as I fed, walked, washed, cuddled and loved her where he would play for a bit then get bored as you do when you’re a 13yo boy. 

Fastforward to about 8ish months into Patty living with my brother I found out he had given her to the neighbour and got himself a new puppy. I was terribly upset

When asked if I could have her back he told me that Patty had taken a liking to the neighbour and she needed her more than me as she was older and had lost her husband and dog within the last 2 years 

I asked why she couldn’t get a dog for herself and he told me that I should take my own advice and just get another dog if that’s what I want. But I wanted my funny little dog who was my study buddy and (admittedly) favourite of the dogs

After weeks/months of inner conflict I finally decided to write a letter and make the 2 hour drive to the neighbours house asking if we could discuss the custody of Patty. As I was putting the letter on her doorstep she arrived home with PATTY! 

The neighbour and I talked, laughed and cried for an hour and a half about how gorgoeous Patty is and about whether Patty should come home with me or not. she was skeptical because of the care she saw my father and brother have for her(hint it was zero) but after our discussion she deemed that Patty would be coming back to a loving family. 

I offered for her to stay longer so that she had a chance to say goodbye citing that I knew exactly what it felt like to have this exact dog taken with no notice, but she said if I didn’t take her now she would have a harder time letting her go. 

We exchanged numbers and I send her updates of Patty regularly and we had organised visits but COVID shut that idea down unfortunately. She now also has a Patty of her own and she sends me updates on him also which is extremely cute and I am really happy she has found herself another companion.

On my way home with Patty I received phone calls and texts from my father, brother, cousins and aunties about what am asshole I am for taking the one thing this lady had and that I am disgusting and a lowlife.

I think I got my beautiful dog back in an amicable way and while I had reservations about asking for her back I am still very happy that I did, but I am worried it was an asshole move to take her away from the lovely lady who needed a companion. 

So am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting a partial refund?,"
So; I have thick, long, dark brown hair that has a history of being dyed over 3 years. I went to this hair salon for a consultation on dying the underlayer of my hair pastel blue, and the rest of my hair black. After telling the stylist my hair's history, I got a quote for $300-ish after chopping a lot of hair off too, with the possibility of having to go a bit darker than I wanted. I was okay with this.

The hair stylist I got at this place was actually the same one I had gotten 3 years before at a different place, where she dyed my whole head red. Back then, I asked for dark red; she ended up doing it much brighter than I wanted, but instead of complaining, I opted to fix it with box dye (which turned out surprisingly well.)I didn't expect to get her again, but fate happened, and so I figured I'd give her another chance.

Fast forward, she's chopped off my hair (now reaches 2 inches or so below my shoulders), and done the bleach, and it's still pretty yellow. She tells me if we dye it like that, it'll have to be much darker blue than what I want. Otherwise, I can get her to do a 2nd bleach another day for a total 
of $220.

 This put me in a lose-lose situation; either I dont pay extra but end up paying $300+ for hair I don't want, or I pay the extra $110 for something I expected the quote to already include. I ended up paying for the extra bleach.

In the end, my hair still didn't turn out fantastic. It's still nice, but the blue is uneven, darker in some spots than others, and overall still isn't really pastel like I wanted. I spoke to one of my friends today who recently bleached out her own hair underlayer for $60 from blue/purple to platinum blonde, and she convinced me I waaay overpayed and that I should've just done it myself.

So, now I feel pretty shitty. I spent a total of like $480 on hair that still isn't exactly what I wanted. I've texted my stylist and told her how I feel I've overpayed for what I ended up getting, but she's saying she ""doesn't always know how hair will lift"" and things like that, which I suppose is fair. Of course, she did spend hours of her time and plenty of product doing my hair too.

Obviously, I know she has to make a decent profit on top of the expenses for products, but considering my hair didn't even turn out how I wanted despite the extra I had to pay, is it fair for me to ask for a partial refund? I'm not the type of person to complain or ask for refunds, but I feel pretty shitty about wasting a whole $500. AITA in this situation?

Edit: She really doesn't seem to want to give any refund, so I don't think I'll be getting one unfortunately.",Not the A-hole
AITA for thinking leaving poop on a bath towel is grounds to move out?,"I can’t make this up and don’t know how else to deliver it other than factually. I live with four housemates. One of them is my close friend. This person, weeks ago, somehow sharted accidentally on our bathroom floor (?) and used a bath towel they thought was mine to clean it up- then left it hung up in the bathroom. When the true owner of the towel discovered it, they were aghast and asked everyone who would’ve done such a thing. 

We all had no explanation until my close friend told me casually in private that they had been the one to do that to the towel. They thought that their only mistake was using the wrong towel- as if if it had been mine, there would’ve been no problem. 

I told the rest of my housemates the truth once I learned this. We are all disturbed and thinking of moving out- this is not the first occurrence of really bizarre behavior, but certainly the most disgusting one. Would I be the asshole if I started looking for a new place? My housemates say they will move out too if I do, starting a domino effect and virtually turning our lease into a logistical nightmare.

AITA for not accommodating an autistic co-worker?,"So I personally feel like I'm not in the wrong but the little voice in my head keeps telling me that maybe I am.

I(28f) have been working for the same company for just over two years now and I really like my job and all of my work mates. I have this habit where I drink a breakfast shake every morning. It contains one banana, 100 grams of strawberries, peanut butter, almond milk and two scoops of protein powder. I keep it in a shaker that can be closed and sip on it throughout the morning.

All was fine until a few weeks ago when a relatively new co worker asked me to please not bring the shake in anymore. I asked why and he said something about textures. I was a bit confused and told him that it's in my shaker and he doesn't have to worry about it leaking or anything. He told me no he's autistic and the texture of my shake is one of his triggers. I said alright and started keeping the shaker my bag and would only take it out when I had a sip whereas I used to just have it on my desk before. I though that was good enough because then if said co worker walks into my part of the office he wouldn't have to look at it. 

Well the inevitable happened and he walked in right as I was having a sip. Shocked he asked why I was still bringing the shake. I apologised for having it out right as he was walking in and explained that I usually keep it in my bag now to accommodate him. He told me that this wasn't good enough and just knowing that the shake was on the same floor could trigger him. I told him that I was sorry but I wouldn't change my dietary routine to this extent just because of him. I'm willing to keep it in my bag but that's as far as I will go. He said that I should be more inclusive and if I won't change my behaviour he might have to get HR involved. This happened on Friday and I'm going back to work on Tuesday. I just want to know if I'm wrong for not accommodating him before I have to face the situation again so I can change if necessary.",Not the A-hole
AITA for making fun of my sister’s disorder,"So I (16, female) have been diagnosed with dyslexia and dyspraxia and my sister (13) has been diagnosed with ADHD. My family always makes fun of my disorders, I struggle a lot with pronouncing words (even simple words) and whenever I make a mistake they always repeat it and mock me and I hate it I have asked them to stop but they won’t. I also have a lot of sensory issues with touch, feels, scents, and sounds which they also make fun of and my sister tries her hardest to make my life worst with these. For example I can’t stand sticky things whenever I touch something sticky or get sticky fingers I have to wash my hands immediately or I start to panic, struggle to breathe, and basically become a broken down mess. My family can always tell whenever I touch something sticky because I stop what I’m doing and run to the nearest sink and they always say either “eW sTiCkY” or “it’s not gonna kill ya” I also can’t stand people touching me, best way I can describe it is it feels like needles in my skin (I have told them this) but they alway touch me, whether it’s just a hand on my shoulder or hugging me or tickling me it seems like they are alway touching me. 

With my sisters ADHD she does nothing around the house, I understand that ADHD affects people but I feel like my parents baby her. She doesn’t vacuum or mop because she can’t be trusted not to get distracted, she doesn’t do the dishes because she never puts them in the correct spot. She has never cleaned her room (I don’t know the reason behind it but whenever I ask my parents they just respond with “she has ADHD”) so I’m in charged of cleaning her room (there is so much stuff in her room that I struggle sensory wise) and her room is always so messy. I clean it every Saturday and every week it seems like she just throws everything off her shelves. Whenever she is asked to do something she throws a screaming fit and I end up doing it.

Tonight I was eating dinner and my sister was scratching her fork against her plate (she knows I don’t like this) while smirking at me and I asked her to stop and she wouldn’t so I stood up to leave and got told to sit back down I mentioned what my sister was doing and my parents told me they didn’t care so I snapped I yelled how I felt like me and my sister were being treated differently and how they never seem to understand me or listen when I tell them to stop and they told me that we were treating us differently because my sister has ADHD a real disorder while I just have some difficulties to which I responded “look at me I’m (sisters name) and my parents baby me and I use my disorder as a excuse to not do anything around the house” I got yelled at, called a ungrateful bitch and sent to my room.

AITA because I angrily texted my brother after he dumped food in the sink?,"I (F23) was cleaning out the fridge this morning when my brother (21M) dumped the remains of his ramen in the sink and went to work. I checked the sink and saw that he had barely eaten it and he had dumped 1/2cup of noodles in the sink. My brother refuses to do household chores like washing dishes, sweeping, cleaning his own bathroom, etc. The only thing he does is take out the trash (he must be asked) and clean his own room. So I was really angry about the disrespect he showed me by dumping so much food in the sink. So I texted him a picture of the heap (we have some mesh over the hole so food doesn’t fall down the drain) and I texted him “are you f***inf serious? Scrape that into the garbage! Stop clogging the sink!” And he texted back “stfu” and then “ask nicely”. To which I replied “I shouldn’t have to ask nicely. I shouldn’t have to ask at all. You should have common sense.” 

I also texted our family group chat “PSA TO NOT DUMP RAMEN NOODLES (OR ANY OTHER FOOD) INTO THE SINK. SCRAPE YOUR PLATES! I’m tired of picking up napkins and entire meals from the sink. Some little bits of food left cannot be helped but half your plate or napkins is not acceptable.”

My mom says I should have communicated more nicely. I think she is part of the problem.

Update: he cleaned the sink. But he made sure to tell me I will attract more flies with honey than with vinegar. I told him that is a misogynistic trope that women have to be agreeable all the time.

AITA for not considering my partners food likes for our trip then telling her she was having a tantrum?,"Tldr
I didn't consider my partners food likes when buying food for our trip and told her she was having a tantrum when she lost it at me. AITA?


I went camping this weekend with my partner.  Since my partner was working part of the weekend I drove out and met our friends, set up and did all the shopping for the trip. Usually when we go camping my partner organises the food and it's usually pretty labour intensive. 

It was all pretty simple fare. I was pushed for time and forgot condiments so no dip or mayo and I didn't get sauces and things just meat veg rice eggs and noodles and snacks


My partner is a chef and a bit of a food snob. I drove a 3 hour round trip to pick her up and take her out. Day 2 the fire brigade came said  no  camp stoves were allowed due to fire danger (I'm in Aus). I'd had several drinks and couldn't drive, my partner doesn't have a licence. So options were rolls, salad and fritters, or wraps. Not much I could do otherwise. 

My partner at this point started making snarky comments that I hadn't thought to buy ANY of the food she likes and there was nothing nice. She actually yelled that I hadn't brought dressing for the salad. Granted in my shopping I was thinking about easy and didn't take the time to make sure her favourites were there.

She wanted to drive into town and I didn't want to drive when I might Be over. I refused to use a stove in fire ban. The fines are enormous AND I 've lived in bushfire areas so I know how important it is to be careful.

she got more and more angry and upset saying she had eaten nothing at all and was starving and I didn't care. I said there was food even if it wasn't her favourite, she was choosing not to eat and I was over her having an adult tantrum and went to hang with  my friends. She sat in the car crying for hours.

I want very sensitive about it and told her she was being ridiculous. I kept offering her food options. Wraps were 'too dry' she didn't like rolls. Couldn't possibly eat salad and veggie fritters because there was no dressing and that was food I liked.

I stopped drinking and said I thought I'd be ok to drive in and pick up dinner at which point she kept saying 'don't worry about me, worry about yourself, I'm not hungry anyway I'm FINE.  So i told her ok, but I'm not going to sit here getting sucked into her b.s.. She went to bed and I stayed with my friends. Slept beside her later because no other option. 

Woke in the morning and she threatens to hitchhike into town if I didn't pack down and leave immediately. I said I'll drive you if you to town of you want to catch a train back or she could wait. I ended up leaving hours before I planned to. I also said somewhere in all of this that is never seen an adult have such a ridiculous tantrum because they didn't have the food they wanted. she told me to fuck off and I said you need freaking therapy. Not nice but hey

Now I'm kicked to the couch and she is refusing to speak to me.

AITA for telling a homophobic colleague that I wouldn't touch him with someone else's pole no matter how desperate I was.,"The transition with the new company is going well for the most part. My role in the transition has been on boarding all the old company employees (those who are staying) to the new company and closing out all the books for the old company and transitioning all the vendors and customer to the new company.  This is going well  for the most part.  My last day is February 26, 2021 and if I get done sooner all the better and I'll get an additional bonus with my severance package from the new company.  Steaming a long yeah I'm ready to be gone and happy to move on so I'm doing what I can to get done sooner than later.  However the main problem I'm having is that one of the people with the new company that I'm working with is pretty awful.  Homophobic straight who when we work together makes it a point to reaffirm his hetrosexualness to me all the time. 

The week before last my husband had a major heart attack.  It was terrible and I was afraid that I was really going to lose him.  I missed a few days work obviously and nobody had any problems with this and my soon to be old boss was right there with me if I needed anything without any questions.  My first day back in office  I had a stack of work that needed to get done and I was in a bad mood from lack of sleep and just being stressed out and overwhelmed. The employee with the new company came into discuss some stuff but realized that he forgot something at his desk.  He turned to leave and I still had my head down looking at paperwork.  He just happened to start walking out of my office and turned his head back to look at me.  I looked up and he was like. I knew it.  You were checking out my ass. Call it lack of sleep, call it lack of caffeine, call it stress.  All I could do was look at him and snap.  My words,  ""I don't care if you are straight.  I don't care about you.  I'm happily married to a man who is twice the man you will ever be and even if I was single and desperate I wouldn't even think about touching you with someone else's pole.  Now get the hell out of my office."" 

My soon to be old boss was walking in my office as this was happening and nodding his head asked if i was ready for our weekly lunch. We went to eat and he asked what was the problem.  I filled him in on the while thing.  I told him that at this point if  wasn't depending on the severance package I would be done and let the new company finish my job. Old boss went to new owner and told him that this needed to be dealt with and if he didn't fix the issue with the other person that he was going to have some serious problems.  Later new owner and employee with my old boss came into my office and employee was forced to apologize and was suspended for two weeks with no pay.

AITA for forcing my mother to get me into therapy and using my teacher to convince her ??,"Let me start this off by saying that me not getting therapy was not a money issue. Every single therapist I suggested is paid fully by insurance which I have.

I have asked my mother for therapy multiple times over 3 years. Back in the day she could see what state I was in and just didn't seem to care. When I tried to explain why I need it, she called me a lazy attention seeker. Over the years, she has stopped believing that mental health problems are a serious thing.

I have failed my classes miserably and my mood is a very big reason for it. My teacher has asked for a reason and I gave it to her. I told her about my struggles with getting out of bed, let alone with working on school work, about a very dear family member having health problems, about my mother refusing my begging for therapy, all that.

My teacher has witnessed me have a breakdown in her office before, so she knew I wasn't making things up. She decided to text my mother about the situation and when she got home, all hell broke loose, but she finally agreed to get me therapy.

Now why I think IATA. I knew exactly that this would happen. My mother cares about her reputation very much and this has basically ruined it with my teacher. I took advantage of the situation, ruined my mothers reputation, just to get what I wanted.

Aita for making my daughter think that a toy burglar will steal some of my daughters toys if she misbehave,"Every since my daughter was 5 (she's 8 now) I'd tell her that a man called the toy burglar will take her toys away and give them to a child who is well behaved if she acts up. 

I even had my current boyfriend dress up as the toy burglar and speak to her while she was misbehaving, she dressed up in a ski mask with black and white top and some red pants with a red scarf. 

After meeting him she started to believe me even more and now when I bring up the toy burglar she will stop misbehaving and say sorry for whatever she did.

But i think its no different then santa like if my daughter is well behaved I'll have the toy burglar randomly send her a gift.

We agreed that my mom would stay with us and she has the master bedroom. She is a semi hoarder and uses every inch of the house for storage not really using stuff. So for the past 2 months we were telling her that the last week of January we would be moving in and she had to go through the kitchen and only keep the items she uses. She didn't want to do it and I would remind her that I would be helping her but she needed to get it started. Well that never happened and I would gently remind her and start doing some with her there and she would get so overwhelmed she would stop. 

Then came down to moving and we needed to move our stuff over because the smaller house was going to be rented out. We needed to reorganize so we took everything out of the cabinets and put them on the counters for her to go through and we would put away what she want using in a storage in the back yard and organize what she wanted to keep. When she had gotten home i told her what we did and what she needed to do so that we can get stuff all put away and we can fit both homes. She got so upset that we did this that she packed everything of hers from the house away minus her bedroom, and for the past three days has been super passive aggressive. I attempted to talk to her to tell her she didn't need to pack everything away and we can keep stuff but only items that she does use. Now she is telling our family that we treat her horribly and she wants to leave.

Aita for telling my sister off in front of our parents,"My sister (25) let's call her Annie, always likes to tell my parents everything about me even if she doesn't know if what she's telling is true. 

I (19) just recently moved out of my parents house which was super hard because they like to baby me and made seem like I was abandoning them or wouldn't be able to make it out on my own. 

Annie came over for a surprise visit to bring me a new things for my house and happened to come when  my boyfriend was over putting together my wall unit for me, i been with my boyfriend for a little under a year and kept him a secret because my parents believe they can choose who I can or cannot date. 

I when I went to the front door I seen my sister through the peep hole and opened the door a little bit, enough for me to see her but not enough for Annie to see inside, Annie push the door open and says I got new stuff for you let me help you set it up and ends up seeing my boyfriend.

She asks who he is and i tell her that he's my boyfriend and ask her to keep it a secret because i wanna wait to see if things are super serious before introducing him to our parents, she looks at my boyfriend with disgust and says our parents will hate him and that he looks like one of those trashy rappers. 

She ends up agreeing not to say anything and leaves shortly after, the next day my parents show up at my house with my sister angry because my sister told them that I have a secret boyfriend and that I'm trying to hide a pregnancy. When I ask my sister whats going on she say something along the lines of your pregnant you need our help, when i asked her why in the world she'd think that I'm pregnant and say you gained a lot of weight and I thought I seen a pregnancy test wrapper in your garage. 

It really pissed me off because there is was no pregnancy test wrappers in the garbage, I was literally on my period, so I told her to f off with your Bullshit and to stop acting all high in mighty when she was doing much more then having a secret boyfriend behind our parents backs and stated listing all the things she did.

Of course my parents were beyond angry and started questioning my sister, i ended up kicking them all when things started to get too crazy for me.

My older brother thinks what I did was overboard because I know how my parents are and now my parents are threatening to disown Annie. 

I feel like Annie tried to get me disown and that she deserves the taste of her own medicine.

AITA for “calling out” last minute?,"I work as a freelancer in a contact heavy industry. due to Covid, it’s very hard to work in my industry. I was lucky to land an hourly position as a keyholder with a “highly viewed” company. IMO, it’s just a retail position in a shopping center paying $17.50 at 20 hours a week. 

I was hired 12/6. They had a Covid scare and my new date was 12/21. Two weeks ago, we were informed by corporate that the store was closing. We were welcome to apply for roles in the company (nonexistent) but otherwise would be laid off 1/28 with the store closing 1/24 to the Public. I have a 5 month old and I need to work so I applied to relevant jobs. 

Luckily, I landed two interviews. It was difficult to schedule because my current job would not give us a schedule. The manager JUST finalized the schedule Saturday night after I scheduled my second interview for today at 12pm. I am scheduled to pack boxes  from 11-3p today. I let them know right away and was told “you can just tell the other place to reschedule.”

Look I get it, but this second interview is basically sealed (I know the assistant there) for a $16 an hour job 32 hours with benefits. I can’t reschedule it. My manager texted me this 
“Hi Shambala.  
It falls at a very inconvenient time as we have ALOT to do tomorrow to complete the store closure. However, the decision is yours to call out for tomorrow. We can discuss it further on your next shift.”

My So says to f them since they laid me off but I feel guilty. AITA?

AITA for basically telling my bestfriend to do his own homework?,"This conflict isn't a major one and is one that just keeps me questioning, me and my buddy get along well still.
One of my best friends from class keeps constantly asking me for my work, usually I accept being that I get my work done kinda early maybe at around 5 pm or so, however him asking does get tedious at times because I do a lot of stuff after I finish. So when he asks through text I either tell him to wait or if I have time give it to him.
This went on for months until maybe about a month ago I snapped because I was stressed that day and had other more important things to do.So I told him that it gets annoying for him to constantly keep messaging nagging me about the homework and he needs to stop and only ask me when he really needs help, he waits a bit and just says sorry and ok. Dead serious only those two words. I was honestly really pissed and messaged another friend that I knew from when we were little and he said that my other friend was just not expecting it and that's why he didn't respond that much. I then get a text from my classmate saying that he relies on me because he says he gets bad grades and he really needs my help. I personally think this is bull because we are both in honors.

AITA for not telling my wife and daughter that I’m dying?,"Hi Reddit.

I’ll try and keep this brief, last august I found out I have brain cancer, I won’t survive. I’m not taking any treatment as I don’t want to draw it out so it’s going to be a brief ordeal.

My wife and daughter have no idea, I’ve done a good job at trying to act like everything is normal and for the most part it has been, my daughter is on track to get into a top tier university this September and my wife and I recently had a great anniversary at home, we went all out and heated up some ready meals and watched Netflix.

My reasoning for deceiving them is this, they don’t need to know and knowing right now will make things difficult, there isn’t a person alive who can stop this from happening so me telling them beforehand just causes them unnecessary pain. My wife is really busy with work and my daughter is working really hard in school, I don’t think it’s right to distract them from that.

Here’s where I think I may be TA. I’m actively lying to the two women I love the most every day by not telling them about this, they are living a normal happy life and have no idea that I won’t be there by Christmas, I may not make it to see my daughter move out. This is going to be a massive shock to them both and I’m concerned for how they will take this.

My parents are also very supportive. 

Her parents were a little uncomfortable at first when our relationship started, but now I get along well with them. I have slowly talked about my transition and do wear men's clothes when at their house. This happened a week ago on Saturday. I went over for dinner and was wearing a cute flannel shirt and jeans with sneakers. I do have my hair cut really short. Her mother made a few small comments about my outfit, but I didn't let it bother me. As we were sitting down for dinner, she asked"" So, you are transitioning to a male?""  I just gulped and calmly answered"" Yes, I am."" She shakes her head and says"" You will always be female no matter what."" 

My girlfriend stood up from the table and started shouting at her mother. I was fighting back tears and sent a text to my dad to come pick me up. He came and I left the house without saying anything.

My brother likes to come upstairs and do exercise at pretty random times. I’ve asked him to be quieter because he groans pretty loud and he just ignores me. It’s annoying because I can’t move my computer to my bedroom so I have to lie to my teachers when he’s in the room and say I’m having mic problems. He has a much bigger room and can fit a double bed and a bigger wardrobe and his desk. I feel like this is unfair because nobody interrupts his work but he keeps interrupting mine.

WIBTA if I didn't tell my mother that I'm planning to get married?,"throwaway bc I don't want you all in my post history

Basically, I (F27) have been in a long distance relationship with my partner (M27) for the past year and change due to covid. He's a key worker and has been vaccinated fully, and will be able to come visit me in a few weeks. We're not engaged yet, but we've been talking about our plans to get married. During the early pandemic, I spent some time living with my mother (F70) and my stepdad (M75), and it was rough. I'd been estranged from them for a long time because my mom has serious narcissistic tendencies and a longtime problem with alcohol, and even though I came back with the idea of looking after them they behaved pretty terribly towards me when I was staying with them.  I moved out quickly, got my own apartment in my hometown, and went back to cordial distance. 

My siblings and I tend to have a distant and polite relationship with my mom. At our last 'family gathering', which was an outdoor, socially distanced gathering of a small number  for my mom's 70th birthday, my stepdad picked a fight with my sister about immigration (he's not a full-on conservative, but definitely a 'contrarian' type who votes third party), and seemed really determined to stir up as much animosity as possible during what was supposed to be a nice occasion. My mom spent a lot of the ensuing weeks trying to get me 'on her side' and divide me against my siblings, and has been really nasty with me on the phone. I've been through quite a bit of therapy to deal with her behavior, and I have a strong policy of hanging up the phone if she gets abusive, and not responding to mean messages. Before this last incident, I would have felt OK introducing her to my partner as part of my family and struggling through a 20-minute coffee for the sake of placating her, because she can be pleasant to be around. 

However, my partner is an immigrant. He came to this country as a teenager, speaks English as a second language, and is visibly nonwhite. My mom and stepdad both know we're dating and have never said anything overtly racist about it, but my stepdad's fight with my sister, combined with my mom's behavior lately, make me unwilling to even let her know he'll be in town, or that we may be getting engaged soon. However, I'm worried about what might happen if she finds out about an engagement, or even his visit, without me telling her.

AITA for wanting my husband to speak to his family in front of me?,"Husband won’t speak to family in front of me AITA for being hurt / wanting change?

Some background - I am Christian, my husband’s family is Jewish; my sister-in-law converted, so they dislike me for because we’re raising our children as Christians (this what we - my husband and I - both agreed to before we got married).  More background - my family is very supportive; his family is very critical of us - our parenting, our life choices, and me generally.
We have not lived in the same state as his family since the first year of our marriage, so our main communication with his family is via phone.  
For years now, whenever he calls his parents or they call us, my husband takes the phone and leaves the room.  If I’m unaware that he’s on the the phone and just happen upon him, he gets up and leaves.  I’ve told him that I find this hurtful - if what they are saying is so problematic, shouldn’t he be defending me and our family?  If it’s innocuous conversation, why does he always leave the room?  Obviously, I never do anything similar when on the phone with my family.  
This is not a few times that I need to just shrug off / suck it up - this has been a constant for years.  I’ve tried a few times before to discuss it with him but I finally just gave up / accepted the hurtful situation.
The final straw just occurred this week.  My husband’s phone was on the kitchen counter, open to the text stream with his parents. He and I were both in the kitchen and I saw the text.  I said ‘oh, your parent’s are getting their apartment painted?’ and he snatched up his phone and ‘scolded’ me for reading it.  It was the breaking point for me - I’ve tried to tell him how much the whole situation hurts me and he insists there is nothing wrong with the behavior.

AITA for walking out during a double date because the other couple was making me uncomfortable?,"My husband (24M) and I (24F) haven't been suffering from the pandemic too much, but we've missed our friends. One couple, ""May"" (22F) and ""April"" (26F) seem to have been missing us too. May has constantly been texting me that they're bored and miss us, so we decided to self-quarantine for two weeks, on both sides, to have a double date.

It was tense from the beginning. Apparently May had gotten bleach on April's expensive dress, which she kept making passive-aggressive remarks about. I thought it was a non-issue until April spilled her wine all over May's dress, and when I went to help her clean it, she said April was trying to ""get even.""

Everything calmed down for a good hour until April started talking about their sex life and how May never puts out (so humiliating), and May says to my husband, ""I bet *you* never have that problem,"" and I was in shock. April laughed it off before telling us what a ""slut"" May is. She kept insulting her even though my husband and I were telling her to stop, and eventually May just started crying.

It got too intense for me and I had to go outside. My husband followed me out and we just ended up driving off. Last night, he told me how guilty he felt just leaving May there to be insulted instead of really doing anything about it, but we both felt like we needed to remove ourselves from the entire situation. April has texted me since saying everything is fine and the quarantine has really been getting to them, but they worked it out. I still feel guilty for leaving, and so does my husband. I honestly feel like I abandoned May and there's a part of me that thinks I did it because she hit on my husband, which makes me feel so petty and disgusting.

This school year I’ve been doing online classes due to Covid and learning remotely from abroad. Because of the online format, I am taking a reduced credit load. This entire school year I only took around 18 credits worths of classes. I did not take credits full time because I really struggle in online classes.

He says that while I’m still living with [my parents] before I go off to the states that I should be taking a higher course load here to “get it over with” but I said that I don’t want to. If it were in person classes, I would have far more motivation to take additional classes but because they are online I have to do what I have to do to be successful even if it means I have to attend an extra year at community college, I did appreciate his advice but said that I needed to do what I needed to do. He then goes on to say how living expenses are expensive and how I should essentially bite off more than I can chew. I get that living expenses in the states are expensive but taking a shitload of courses especially online does not fly for me. I told him politely that I wasn’t gonna take extra classes online and would wait until in person class to take extra classes.

AITA for thinking its weird when people bring up how I'll be a good mom,"(also please don't repost anywhere)

I'd like to preface this be saying I am a young adult,  I'm not in a relationship, and I'm not childfree. So I have had random people in my life, mainly men, tell me I would be a good mother when I had a nurturing or caring moment. And me being peeved at it. 

At 16, I held a job where I'd interact with kids, and after talking with a kid for awhile about what sort of toy he'd like from the Prize Counter, my 50+ manager tells me I'd be a good mom. Not that I'm a good employee or I work well with kids. At the time I laughed it off, which encouraged him to then say, ""Just wait you're gonna have one kid, not want to stop and end up with 5."" I told him I wasn't even thinking about that, and avoided him at all costs. Next time it was my teacher, a former student of his visited his class, I said something along the lines of how cute and calm the baby was. Which prompts my teacher to say, ""She'll make a good mom."" Again I laughed off the comment, and luckily he didn't say anything further. Finale time was my mother, I am her youngest, tell me I would make a good mom because I am protective and coddle my dog.   


Recently I was talking to a former classmate, and we were talking about said teacher, not for what he said to me, but I brought it up.  
 He was next to me when the teacher made the comment and in the moment I think I said something to my friend, like ""that was weird"", but I don't remember his response. Said friend said I was taking it too seriously and that its a natural response to tell a women she'd be a good mom and its a compliment. I brought up all my other experiences where I felt weirded out. I told him I felt that I wish people's responses to my nurturing instincts weren't purely maternal, especially as a teenager. As they could have easily said relating to professions, like a nurse, doctor, or social worker. Something where these instincts would come in handy. That I didn't know why they had to bring my uterus into the equation, imo. 

My friend said I was overreacting and taking it too seriously. That its not negative to tell someone, even a teenager, they'd make a good mom.

WIBTA for upgrading the mouse cage I’m petsitting without being asked to?,"TLDR: Petsitting for my sister in law to be, she doesn’t take very good care of her pets, especially her mice. Would I be overstepping if I purchased better stuff for their enclosure? I don’t want to sacrifice our relationship by coming across as rude, but I would love to help if I can. 


My SIL (21ish, F) is out of town and has asked my fiancé (19 M) I (19 M) to watch her cats while she’s gone. This is no issue since we live together and because it’s probably the cleanest the cat area will be for months. 

She routinely neglects to clean the litter boxes for a week or more at a time, which with 6 cats, builds up, leading to the entire floor smelling horrible. We have to walk through the cat room every time we want to access any part of the house other than our bedroom (which sucks, lmao)

First day of cat sitting, fiancé cleaned the cat room, I decided to clean her mouse cage. She didn’t ask us to do anything for her mice, but I was cleaning my own mouse cage anyway and felt like being nice. 

Right away, I realized that this cage had not been cleaned in at least a month, very easily much longer.  

A quick rundown of the issues with the setup I noticed for those curious. If not, skip to the line of asterisks! 

1: pine bedding (huge no no, can cause URI’s)

2. Very small wheel buried in the bedding and coated in urine + bedding

3. Instead of ensuring that the food was eaten at all, she would just dump more food into the spot where the food bowls were buried, leading to the cage floor being a mixture of uneaten food mixed with feces and urine. 

4. The bowls had bedding, feces, and food /caked/ onto them

5. The food she uses is bad quality and has an incredibly high fat content (would explain the very overweight mouse she has) 


****** 

I cleaned everything out, added the rest of my bedding, and put it all back together

In the process, I added a wheel that my mouse didn’t love, and a small spinner disk from an unused cage of hers. 

I also put in some food I have for my own mouse, which should be healthier. 

I want to buy a larger spinner disk, as well as healthier food for when she returns. 

But idk if I would be putting our relationship at risk by doing so. I want to be helpful but I don’t want to damage such an important connection. 

Would I be overstepping if by the time she gets back I’m like
 “oh yeah I got this spinner disk for your mice because I got a discount, and I also grabbed you some food because I was out buying bedding anyways, feel free to use it if you want! Oh, and feel free to use my new bedding too!”

AITA for not sharing my telegram and whatsapp passwords with my parents?,"I (17M) have been in lockdown since March and had no mobile phones or any such devices. When my mom upgraded her phone she gave me her old one. But my mother also gave me her tablet for watching the class and for reading the notes. 

I for one always wanted privacy whenever I did anything. I feel very disturbed whenever someone watches over me while I'm studying or doing anything. I specifically told everyone about that. I don't like to be watched over like that.

For sharing classroom materials, I had to use whatsapp and telegram. So I joined these platforms and I was in contact with my friends within a short span of time.
 
I am a privacy freak as I mentioned before. So I put passwords in my accounts so that noone else uses it.

Today when I was using telegram my mom came over and saw the lock screen. She asked me why did I lock it? 

I replied that it was my account and I valued my privacy. But my mom told me to tell her the password. I said no. She demanded it again and I said no. I again said that I don't want to feel like being watched over and I would very much appreciate my privacy.

(I would like to add that there is nothing illegitimate or any NSFW content there. I'm clean af.)

My mom certainly didn't appreciate that answer and pulled the parent card - We are your parents and you should obey us.

Now my dad wasn't home (the work had started) and  she said that my dad will get furious about this.

I replied that I always respected their privacy then why can't they respect mine? I am not unlocking my chat details because it's mine and I never interfered with her private details. She was not happy.

I am very sure that when dad gets home he will just guilt trip me into unlocking.

You might be thinking that I might be the AH. The reasons why I did that is as follows:

1) My parents were very strict and didn't even let me play any games or sports with my friends. I had to beg to play video games

2) They made a lot of false promises while I was growing up and I was constantly bullied my classmates and whenever I stand upto them, it's my fault. So I had a lot of trust issues.

3) A lot of my relatives are spot on Entitled. Entitled to their opinions and never admit their wrongs (Except my mom's grandparents. They are angels).

4) For once in my life I had privacy and I'm not going to give it away

5) It's always them and how they feel.

So, I (24 F) got home this morning around 9 am after having worked an overnight. When I came in, I saw that my husband's (24 M) airpods case was on the kitchen floor. I picked it up (it was closed) and put it further back on the kitchen counter where I'm assuming it had been left. 
 
I thought nothing of it until just a few minutes ago. He came and asked me if I knew where his airpods were. I said I had picked the case up this morning and placed it back on the kitchen counter. He became midly upset at me and said the airpods were not in the case. He asked me why I hadn't thought to look in the case when picking them up. I responded that the case was closed, otherwise I would have looked. He kept repeatedly asking why I hadn't looked and kept saying it would have been nice if I had looked.

I got a bit frustrated with him and said he shouldn't have left his airpods on the kitchen counter anyway. Our cats love getting onto the counter and knocking down anything, in true cat fashion. When that happens, often the dog will eat what they've knocked down- food or no. So, we're trying to get ourselves out of the habit of leaving things on the kitchen counter, as convenient as it may be... But I was the one who put it back on the counter, chalk it up to carelessness or sleepy state from my 18hr shift.

We looked around the kitchen for a bit and found they were under the fridge. The first one came easily after a little help with a thin broom. He calmed down a bit. The second one did not come easily. He became very agitated. We tried using all sorts to get it out and eventually, he was able to pick the fridge up, and I snagged it. The second one was broken. The rubber bit that goes in the ear was torn off- could have been dog or cats. It's also pretty scratched up.

He's frustrated, but I told him that I don't think I did anything wrong. I really thought they were in there; the case was closed. I'll probably check from now on, but should I have to begin with? AITA",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking my sister’s boyfriend to delete our wedding ceremony video from his Facebook?,"Long story short: My husband’s parents are in another country and couldn’t come to our wedding because of Covid. 

As such, we wanted to elope and have a real wedding later with everybody. My mom got upset when I told her this, and we felt pressured to convert it into a small family ceremony at our house (6 guests - 2 are vaccinated; others got tested) 

We asked my sister’s boyfriend to officiate and he was totally down. 

My husband’s brother recorded the ceremony on his phone to share with my in-laws, and we uploaded it (along with the photos we took) to a shared Google album for our 6 guests. To keep it special and private, we asked for no social media posts. We want the real wedding to be the ceremony we share. 

The next day, my sister’s boyfriend texted me saying he really wants to upload pics of our ceremony to Facebook. Since we don’t have many mutual friends, I said it was fine to upload a few pics if that will make him happy. 

Well, he uploaded the video of our entire ceremony to his Facebook. And if I’m being honest, it feels like this was more about him wanting people to see him in the spotlight of officiating more so than a celebration of our marriage. 

I texted him and asked him to delete the video from Facebook, but I said the pics are fine, and I didn’t even mind if he texted a few close friends or family the video of his performance. I explained again that we really just wanted to keep the ceremony private and special off of Facebook. 

He and my sister are now upset with me and think I’m an asshole for asking him to remove the video. I feel like I’m going crazy and that my husband and I are just asking for a little respect for our privacy. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for leaving historical artwork on the wall while on ZOOM?,"I can't believe I'm having to ask this, but here we go. 

I (32M) am of Native American ancestry. As you can predict by the post title, I have several Native pieces of artwork in my apartment. 

I am a teacher, and, as according to the laws in my city, am teaching over ZOOM. A parent, evidently, caught sight of the artwork and complained to the school about it. She apparently said that I was 'shoving' it down her child's throat and asked for me to either remove the artwork or find a new place to teach the kids. 

I was given those two options. I chose the latter, even though it involved me having to change my whole teaching set-up. The parent hasn't said anything else, but it, for some reason, has been kinda bothering me for awhile.

AITA for not learning my husband’s native language?,"My husband 33(M) and I 32(F) have been married for five years now. After rounds of IVF, we finally had our daughter Shelly (10 months).

My husband travels a lot for work . My husband claims that his native language is going extinct and he will like to teach our daughter. I think this is a great way for them to bond and I was glad he took this initiative. My husband recently shared an article with me that basically stated that for children to pick up a second language, it has to be spoken to them 30% of the time. He asked me to learn his language so that I can teach it to our daughter. I told him I couldn’t since I was juggling too much already. He got really upset and said that I’m trying to erase his side of our daughter’s identity. My mother in law agrees with him and said that I should have learned the language a while ago without being asked.

AITA for telling him he has no choice?,"We are both 27. Been together 9 years. 

Back in 2015 his brother ran into trouble and needed a lawyer fast (stuck his dick in crazy and got locked up over it). My boyfriend was losing his shit and spiraled into deep depression thinking he was never going to see his brother again because they couldnt afford a lawyer. I was sitting on nearly $20k in savings at that point and made a deal with him. I would help with his brothers lawyer fees but he owed me. Not money, but when the time came and something big happened to me or a family member, he couldnt tell me no to helping them out, no matter what. After all, taking my entire savings and slapping it on a lawyer was huge.

Well, my mom ended up in rehab after a major surgery complications on October 24th, 2020 and she needs to have a live in caregiver. She leaves rehab in 2 weeks. Given that this was huge, I made sure to ask my BF about it prior to using the ""you owe me"" card and gave him a choice to say no. The thing is, he didnt. He said ""Absolutely! I owe you anyways."" Our lease was going up so he started house searching for a home for all of us, mom included. 

Well, it's been weeks and slowly he is backing away from the idea. He isnt vocal about it but he just stopped responding to landlords who were willing to rent to us. Or every single time we find a place, he finds excuses to not move there. He doesnt like the kitchen. He doesnt like that it's only 2 bedrooms. He doesnt like the floors. He doesnt like that part of town. It's always something. Well, I found a house that is absolutely gorgeous and meets all his criteria. His excuse this time? ""My ex lives two streets over."" So, I googled it. Her house is 17.4 miles away and they dated when the were freaking 15. It's literally an excuse. So I confronted it and asked him wtf was going on and he says ""I'm 27 and honestly dont want to live with your mom."" I said ""Absolutely not. You have no choice. You owe me and you already said yes. I was 22 and slapped over every cent of my $20k savings and I didnt want to do that but still did."" Hes saying that I'm an AH for saying that and that this is completely different.

ETA: I was never paid back the $20k. I also work full time and make $65k annually. He works part time from home and makes roughly $20k a year. I pay most bills, not that it matters. But just for arguments sake, I will leave this here because I know y'all will ask about it.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my husband to buy his own laptop and taking mine back?,"Last year for Christmas my 38f husband 40m bought me a new gaming laptop. I don’t have a lot of games, I like The Sims and Minecraft, but was disappointed when my ten year old laptop finally died and I could no longer play them. 

I have used this new laptop to play my games maybe five times in the last year. Any time I want to use it, he is on it. When I tell him I want to load up one of my games he says to let him finish his match. He eats while he is using it, even though I have asked him repeatedly not to do that because it makes the keys greasy and gross. He’s dropped my lap desk twice because he keeps forgetting it’s plugged in and I had to get a new one. 

Last night I wanted to play and the second I turned it on he said that he needed it for a match with friends. I told him that I was using it and he would have to wait. The entire time I was playing he was talking to his friend and making passive aggressive comments about how I was hogging the computer and he’d be on when I was done being stubborn. I got angry enough that I just logged off Minecraft and went to bed. 

This morning I woke up early and deleted his profile off my laptop and changed the password. When he came downstairs he said he had a D&D game lined up and needed it, and I told him no. That it was my laptop that if he needs a laptop he needs to buy himself one. I told him that I deleted his profile and changed the password because he could not respect that this was my laptop.

WIBTA IF I SAT MY BROTHER DOWN AND TOLD HIM ITS TIME TO FACE REALITY,"Hi,
I’m going to the virtual world for some advice , I would like to apologize in advance for any errors this is my first post 

So I (24F) belong to a family of divorced parents. I have two siblings a sister (F28) and brother (M22). Me and sister starting working when we’re at legal age , mainly to reduce my parents spending (we were higher middle class but after the separation they both barley make do). My brother, Randy on the other hand   barley graduated highschool, has never worked a day in his life and lives off my dad/mom e.g. they bought him multiple cars, pay his insurance, phone bill, any tickets, give spending money (me and sister were never granted this- and before you ask he is more than capable to work, he often blames MH but we have lived w/him for years and me & sister have started to believe this is just an excuse). It doesn’t have be 40hrs/week, but even a casual position I think will give him purpose and give him enough to make afloat with his bills.

Me and my sister expressed how unfair this to us but also to them. My parents refuse to communicate with each other and my dad chalks it up to he lives with his mom so it’s her problem. Since COVID has touched down he uses it as an excuse (no one is hiring but truly companies are hiring if you really wanted). 
I’m growing more concern as my brother is just living off their money and stays home playing games and smoking. My parents refuse to do anything about this, and I’m afraid he will become me and my sister’s responsibility if anything were to happen to my parents. Me personally , I wouldn’t have the heart to leave him in the cold but I wouldn’t be able to afford to take him on as my child essentially nor would I want to.

The issue is that my brother flys off the handle and talking about this will really damage our relationship (he is very sensitive and does feel bad about his behaviour ... still refuses to change). 

Would I still be the a**hole if I just sat him down and told it’s time to start working - and explain why and also explain how him taking my mom’s (and dad’s) money buries them further and they aren’t getting any younger ?",Not the A-hole
"AITA for ""embarrassing"" my sister by asking a stranger about his bike","Honestly, I dont think I am the a-hole here, but I just want to know if o was being weird. 

Today my sister (26), my cousin (m29) and I (m30) went to a nearby shop to get some groceries. In the parking, I saw a motorbike which was obviously modified and looked really great. It's the same model of my first bike and I am also thinking of getting mine modified. So i started asking nearby if the bike belonged to them.

Later the owner of the bike came out and I started talking to him. I wanted to ask where he got it modified, how much it costed, etc. I admit that I was a bit excited. However the guy who owned the bike was happy to answer all the questions. Infact he worked on the bike himself. He even mentioned how he got some of the parts specially imported from another country. When he found out that I was also interested in getting some work done on my bike, He even gave some great advice, his contact details and contact details of some mechanics who would be very helpful. (The bike on question stopped manufacturing about 20 years back and it's considered a classic here).

When we came home, my sister started yelling at me saying I was over enthusiastic and embarrassed ourselves in front of a stranger. This happened a couple of times before as well and always when my sister was around. Once, I complimented a stranger and asked where they got their jacket and its brand. He was also happy that someone noticed his new jacket. Another time I asked a relative about his perfume. It's not like I stuck my nose inside his armpits or anything. The perfume was very obvious and very pleasant smelling and he was sitting right beside me.

My sister argued that I dont have boundaries and should not invade their privacy. However i pointed out that all the instances people didn't seem offended. Infact the guy with jacket was very happy. 

The thing is, due to some recent ongoing issues inside family, tensions are running high (A whole other post and lot of ranting and fights). And I shouted at her that she was just taking out her frustrations about that issue and not about me embarrassing her.

However my cousin later told me I was also in the wrong. Want some outside perspective. AITA for just complimenting some strangers and asking details?",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to cook without eggs or gluten even though my housemate is severely allergic?,"For my job, I have been seconded to a different region for 6 months. During this time, I am being put up in share-housing with 3 other roommates who have similar terms, however shifted by a couple of months.

The share house is meant to be “fully stocked”, however it was pitifully so. Between 4 people there is 1 fry pan, four sets of cutlery, 1 spatula, and 4 sets of bowls, plates, and cups - and nothing else. 


On the first day I noticed that this was woefully unacceptable and made the 3 hour trek home and back to gather my own things. This included: cutlery, crockery, knife block, chopping boards, mixing bowls, measuring cups, fry pans, saucepans, mixer, and much more. Essentially I stocked the entire kitchen. At the time I talked with the other 3 and they were happy for me to leave this added equipment in the kitchen on the proviso that they be able to use it to. This was fine with me as long as it was cleaned and taken care of. This arrangement worked well for the first month or so. It should be noted that we all prepare meals separately. 


Last week one of the previous roommates finished their term, and a new roommate moved in. This roommate informed us that she has a severe egg and gluten allergy and requested that we not cook anything containing eggs or gluten using communal cookware. She stated that ingestion of eggs and gluten via cross contamination has caused her to have an anaphylactic reaction in the past. I informed her that I would be happy to help her clean the communal equipment and not cook anything containing gluten or eggs on the cookware that came with the share house, but given that these are basically staples in my diet, I would continue to cook using gluten and eggs on the equipment I brought. I then pointed out all the equipment I had brought and exactly which equipment came with the share house (which was already neatly separated out to avoid mixing equipment when I inevitably move out). I stated I would ensure that the cleaning equipment (which I also brought mind you) would be kept separate too so there would be no confusion. 


At this the new housemate stated that it was unfair that I was refusing to make, “a few small changes,” to my diet when she had a severe and life threatening allergy that she can’t control. I offered the solution that I would remove all my cookware from the kitchen and store it in my room so she wouldn’t get confused and accidentally use the wrong equipment, but this didn’t seem to satiate the new housemate’s anger either. 


I don’t think it’s unreasonable that I should be able to cook what I want on my own cooking equipment, but others have stated that I’m being an arsehole because my new roommate can’t control her allergies and I’m being completely insensitive to that. They’ve said it’s only 5 more months and I should suck it up and just modify my diet until her term is up.  

So, AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA to walk out from a second interview?,"So I'm a (19M) and decided to find a job while waiting for university enrollments, which I found a local car showroom recruiting salesperson. I went for an interview shortly after applying 

The interview started quite normally but things went weird for me when the interviewer(a mid-age man) started flocking me with profanities loudly. Also after acquiring my address (I live in the ""good parts"" of town according to his judgment), he started to say how rich kids like me won't make a good car salesman and how I shouldn't waste his time and stuff. To say my family is considered ok financially. Also he stated many previous salespersons who act like ""me"" would just come and go.

The interview ended with me feeling weird and so but anyways I went home waiting for news. That night they messaged me for a second interview which I politely refused due to I don't like how they treat interviewers. 

They replied for having the CORRECT judgment about me and how soft I was being the rich kid. They say its a good lesson for me to have in a young age because thats how the society is, meeting customers and sort would not be a pleasant experience. 

So AITA to refuse their second interview? Or it was just some tactic they ploy up to find the tough dull to assault kind of salesperson? I've been asking on other communities and they say I should have put down my dignity and stuff to take up the job(since the economy wasn't good), or just go back home and find my mom. They also mentioned how easy i had it and how hard they did, meeting all those chaotic customers, where i should endure it as many succesful people endured many of these? Which wasn't helpful.

I agree that sometimes there's some chaotic people to face in life and sometimes we get scolded whatsoever. But I do think mutual respect between interviewers and the employer should be present. Or is it just me being too soft for society?

AITA for wanting to sell my late dad’s house against step siblings wishes?,"My dad was in a relationship with my (29M) step siblings mom ever since we were little kids. I was 5, my step sister and brother were 6 and 8. They moved into our house, which my dad inherited from his parents when they died. 

They were together for years but didn’t actually get married until I was 13 

The marriage only lasted 3 years and they divorced. They still used to come over all the time because they still considered him their dad and I their brother. But when their mom got back together with their dad they completely stopped coming by. 

My dad would call them on birthdays or holidays but they always ignored his calls. When I finally got a hold of them asking what was up, they said they finally have their family back in tact and don’t have the time to go see him anymore. This really broke my dad’s heart. I know he loved them very much. 

We ended up moving an hour away after my dad got a new job in my last year of highschool. He ended up renting out the house over the years.

When my dad got sick last year, he told me he was leaving the house to me and I was free to do whatever I want with it. Pretty much to give me permission to sell it, use the money to pay off school debt and put it in a savings or for a down payment on my own home. That’s what I decided to do in the end when he passed.

Had to fix it up a little but it’s currently back on the market. My step siblings contacted me for the first time in years and when they found out I was selling the place, they begged me not to because it’s their childhood home. 

They think I’m being greedy for only thinking about making money off it when it has sentimental value. I almost blew up at them because where was this energy about the importance of family and memories when he was ignored all these years? 

They were invited to the funeral as well but never responded. I instead told them that he gave me his blessing because he knew I was still struggling to pay off my student loans and wanted it to be invested in my future. 

This hasn’t stopped them from bugging me about reconsidering and I’d be a huge asshole for selling the home we all grew up in. It’s not that they want a cut of the money, it’s that they don’t want the house to be sold off to someone else when it was our childhood home. 

It’s all become very complicated and they’re very upset about me still wanting to sell it. AITA?",Not the A-hole
"AITA for publicly sharing an experience that has ""hurt"" and ""divided"" my family?","Ok, this happened a few months ago, but the fallout is ongoing and it'll take small context. And I can't even believe this is a thing.

I grew up mixed (race/ethnicity, depending on who you ask- arab/white), and spent the majority of my life with my white family. Divorced, mom was main custodial parent, grandparents(Gma,Gpa) helped out a lot. I was super close to my Gpa, he exposed me to poetry and a love of literature and language early on and we were super close.

I also grew up in a family that saw my Lebanese immigrant father as ""one of the good ones"" and told me most of my early young life I should be ""thankful I was born here (Texas) and not in that horrible place"" and-starting as early as 9-that I was so beautiful because I looked so ""exotic."" So, like microaggressions to my face-I found out my gparents thought much worse of me as I got older and my mom shared some things.

So I came up in the 80s and 90s (37f) and being arab wasn't yet as terrible as it would become. I had a funny accent and hard to pronounce last name, occasionally called a terrorist on the playground. Nothing terrible.

When I was 18, 9/11 happened. I was spending Thanksgiving that year with my family when my Gpa said ""I fully support internment camps for Arab-Americans"" and I was like ""Pawpaw, that's my dad, me (as first gen), my (half) siblings(then 4f,8f,12m)"" and he said ""well, we have to sacrifice some of the innocents for the good of the nation.""

Something broke in my 18 yr old self that day and nothing was ever the same. 9/11 brought me and my family much pain and heart ache and violence acted out against us, but that moment is forever branded in my memory.

This past 9/11 a hashtag was going around from those that were young and the impact 9/11 had on their lives and family. I partook in the hashtag, listing out all the various impacts 9/11 had on me and my family. I included that moment with my grandpa in the list. It should be mentioned he passed in 2014.

My cousin (26f) on my mom's side saw the post and LOST it. Showed it to our Gma. The whole (white) family. And they came down hard. My mom said I should ask before posting things about our family (shut that down quick), I've unfriended all of my fam, which, whatever, I didn't have many to begin with, I'm far too left for them. 

But they are all so angry with me for speaking ill of the dead and our patriarch and our Gpa. Like wouldn't do a zoom call over the holidays with me and my husband. I loved him until the day he died, I didn't cut him out, and that moment changed the course of my life.

AITA for sharing a story about my Gpa that makes him look bad? It just hurt so many people that I would do something like that, and I don't know if I actually am the asshole in this. Like, why wouldn't they be sorry he would say that to who was ostensibly another child of his? Ultimately, my cousins are not speaking with me anymore and I hurt my mom and aunt and gma.

WIBTA If I told my boyfriend to stop giving our roommate the silent treatment?,"Throwaway, household knows my Reddit.

My (33D) SO Jeremiah ( 30M, fake name) and I have VERY different communication styles. In a fight I want to talk things out, but he shuts down and does not want to chat or be pressed to talk if he is in a conflict. It’s common that he will stop talking and just silently play games/roll over and go to bed after a fight. 

Sometimes by morning he is speaking again, but whoever he fought with might be dead to him. He has blocked several friends and ceased all communication with at least 4 people since I met him. Some for good reason IMO, others I didn’t personally agree with. 

When I tried to give my take/input or urge conflict resolution, Jeremiah felt I was being controlling/pressuring, and nothing triggers him worse than feeling someone is trying to control his actions. 

These days I try hard to be as respectful of his choices as possible. I have say in our relationship, but not in how he conducts his friendships. 

The problem is he fought with our roommate Chris in December, and refuses to acknowledge him or speak to him in any way. If asked a question Jeremiah acts like our roommate is invisible. He doesn’t acknowledge him at all. It has made it feel really tense at home, and as I’m friends with Chris I am feeling really unhappy about it.

WIBTA if I tell my boyfriend I think he should at least be polite with Chris? They don’t need to be friends again (although I feel this is a waste of a friendship), but I do think it’s reasonable to expect everyone behave as adults. 

It’s not as though Chris did something egregious. He can be annoying and troll around, but he immediately apologized for his part in their spat that day.  

I don’t want to be disrespectful of Jeremiahs right to decide who he speaks to, but it’s also really tense and unhappy in the house now. Jeremiahs continued response just strikes me as so childish.

WIBTA if I asked my neighbors to stop being so smelly (Weed)?,"Sorry if this isn’t as dramatic as I think it is. But my neighbors and I do not get along. They are terrible neighbors who ruin the day and night with thier loud music. I teach online and even my students can hear them. So there’s a lot of banging. Its not the best or the kindest method but when it gets to rowdy, I kind of stomp on the ground. These are not thin walls and I’m not that big of a lady. But to break through to them, I have to literally shake thier roof.

Anyway, there is another pressing issue. They smoke a lot of weed and I can always smell it. Again, I teach from home and teaching while your apartment is being hotboxed at 10am is not fun. But its not just mornings. Its all day, every day. If you were to walk into my own apartment you would think that I’d smoke! But I haven’t smoked in a year and have been sober for 3 months. Sobriety is great but even that would be easier if I didn’t walk into my own apartment and smell weed. 

I have a drafted letter, a candle, and some dryers sheets from the store. I’m trying to be nice by asking them to stop and giving them some tips on how to not smell like they have thier own farm?

AITA for filing small claims over eyelash extensions?,"Obligatory: throw away account, mobile, don’t share or post/repost this anywhere. TLDR at the end. 

A friend invited an esthetician to her home to do eyelashes. Esthetician said she would give us a discount for coming to friend’s house. She is running 2 hours late, 4.5 hours of application and charges me $50 more than advertised. I didn’t want to cause a scene at the host’s house so I paid it. 

The lashes are much fuller than what I asked for, they are falling out, sharp and poking me. Esthetician said she tried a new glue and that it’s “not the best Im so sorry!” The next day she removed them. Two days pass, my eyelids are still swollen, red, and painful. Esthetician refuses the refund. I’m talking with another girl who had a similar experience and we find out that she was using strip lashes with glue which we are told is a rookie mistake.

I send a “refund request” on Venmo and she denies it. I send another letting her know that I will be pursuing small claims court and calling the board on Monday. She blocks me. I find out she has been talking behind my back all day about how I’m “threatening to destroy a single mother’s career over $150.” I get this sounds like a Karen thing, but she has ghosted, blocked, and refused to fix her mistake. I just want my money back. 

TLDR: esthetician used “new glue” which caused a ‘rookie mistake’ and I had to get them removed less than 24 hours later. It left my eyes red, swollen, and painful. She refused a refund then blocked me. AITA because I want to file small claims and file a complaint?

UPDATE: Called the state today. She isn’t allowed to practice anywhere other than the address on her license, and she is licensed through the state as a “facialist.”  They informed me that if given proper training she could do lashes. I’ve asked the person who handles the complaint to call me tomorrow to discuss my options. I’ve researched small claims court and what I can legally ask for. I keep hoping she sends me my money back because this has gotten so out of hand and $150 lashes are about to turn into court costs, serving fees, and possibly fines from the state. I have felt guilty because I didn’t want to be the cause of her misfortune- but honestly, she is forcing my hand and playing the victim.",Not the A-hole

I’m single mom of two kids (1 & 4), no one could watch them. Before we went in, I made it clear we were there to get 2 things, stated what they were and said I wasn’t buying anything else.

Things were good until checkout. Oldest saw the damn impulse buy candy and wanted one. She had already had ice cream so I said no. She got upset and started a fit. I said no again and continued check out. That’s when an older lady said “oh, I’ll buy it for you.” I said “no thank you”. She said “but she’s so cute, she needs candy”. I replied “no one needs candy, we’re fine”. 

The older lady said “Oh come on”. My oldest was still carrying on and my youngest daughter was ripping something from my purse. I snapped and said “I said no!” I quickly finished checking out and lead my crying daughter out the door. My eldest calmed down by the time we got home.

I was telling a friend about the situation and she said I should’ve just let the lady buy the candy and that I was too mean. I can see how I might have been an asshole. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for getting annoyed at my SO for talking to her friends?,"
Obligatory that I’m on mobile

In order to try to give some privacy, Im going to leave out names and ages.


For the last few months, one things has been constantly bugging me, which never seems to be solved.

That is, whenever I am spending time with my SO, they are on their phone. Ill make the statement that, when we are out and about, they wont always be doing so.

Regardless, whether it be just us sitting and relaxing watching a show together, or walking around, it seems they can’t keep away from their phone. It’s constant conversations, dragging attention away from what we’re doing. 

Bear in mind I like that they have friends, and are keeping a relationship happy; however, constantly looking over to see them on snap or texting is getting on my nerves. They say that “Im helping them with a problem” (personal that is) or “I’ve seen this before” (when watching a show together) or more aggravating “we’re having a conversation”, which is all fine and good. Yet, that is always the reason given, regardless of the situation. Any time I’ve mentioned my annoyance in any way, I get a finger wag (figuratively) and shut down. 

Im all for them talking to their friends, but constantly playing psychiatrist or conversation maker gets annoying. 

AITA?

AITA for not wanting to lose my room?,"Here's the background info 

My Mother (M), Stepfather (S), Twin (T 19), and I (19)moved from Texas to Louisiana about 7ish years ago. When we moved my Stepfather did not have custody of his daughter (R 20) and so the house we have is a three-bedroom house with a thousand square foot garage separate from the house. The garage was converted into a massive bedroom with two sets of bunk beds for us three girls to sleep in in the summer (when R would be here). This garage has an ac/heating unit and is insulated. It is also just a few seconds of a walk to get inside. The first summer we had the house, R was with us and we all slept out in the garage every night. During the following school year, she decided she wanted to live with us and that happened. At some point in the year, she saw a centimeter big spider in her bed and freaked (she has arachnophobia), she decided she didn't want that to be her room and moved in the house into T's room. Since only the master bedroom was made for two people that did not go over well. We converted the laundry room (not wide but pretty long) into her bedroom. She was fine with that for 5ish years, she moved out to go to college for a year but spent all her money and recently moved back in. 

Here's the problem, these past couple of months I have been spending a few nights at a close friend's (A) house. I would do this on the weekend so I could still study. S started to have a problem with that and told me if I spent 2 nights a week there I would lose my room to R and have no say about this. Not only did she like this idea but then 2-3 days later she approached S (while I was in the room) and asked if she gave him $100 a month if she could just *take* my room. He said to take it up with me because she would have to give me the money, not him. I said no because I have furniture in my room that was a gift from my grandmother and that I would have to get rid of all of it if this happens and other belongings and it's *my* room. Lately, I've been spending 1 night a week at A's and it's been wonderful and stress-free, sort of. I spent 2 nights there this past weekend and it took a while before I was promised the safety of my room. This is frustrating because right now A (and her brother) is the only social life I have other than work and M and S would give me shit about not having a social life but are actively trying to prevent it, *because they want me home*. M has brought up multiple times ""if you don't want to have to get rid of your stuff then move to the garage instead of her room. And R will stop bringing it up"". 

Yes, if I do that I keep my furniture, but it will break when moved as it is very fragile and old and I don't think I should be forced to move 6 pieces and all my stuff so she gets what she wants. If I try to spend multiple **days** **not nights** at A's, my room is in danger.

AITA for telling my daughter to grow up and manage her own money?,"Me (50s M), Jules (21F) I've been a single dad for most of my daughter Jules's life. It was really hard especially financially. My career is successful now and I'm putting Jules through college. She doesn't have a job or driver's license and is focused on her studies. This is fine but she also continues to pester me for money for things that only matter to her. I used to give her an allowance but over Thanksgiving I found out she was buying alcohol and suspended the allowance.

She was doing fine without it but her classes started up again recently and the other day she called me up to whine about the professor requiring students to buy the textbook he wrote that's way more money than she feels like spending. I said to dip into her savings but Jules said she doesn't have any! Then she asked me to buy it for her and that frustrated me. I told her she's not entitled to my money especially when I'm putting her through college. She gave me some attitude about how I'm not doing enough and that was when I got really mad. I told her that for an adult she's acting pathetic and she needs to sort out her own resources before she comes whining to me. At that point Jules hung up.

Later on her Instagram she posted something about how OCD is ruining her life and that she had to drop a course she needs because I wouldn't help her with the book. I sent her a text asking her to explain herself and she deleted the post saying she meant for it to post ""somewhere else"" which is an obvious lie. Also, my daughter does not have OCD. She has stopped replying and at this point I'm not sure there's anything I can do about her.

I told my wife about this over dinner and she asked why I couldn't just buy Jules the book she needs. It wouldn't impact me financially to do so, but I think the most important part of parenting is establishing boundaries. My wife got annoyed with me and has been cold to me for the past two days since it happened and I'm starting to wonder if I've gone wrong somewhere. Jules did seem incredibly upset after our conversation and it's possible I'm being too harsh or stubborn so maybe I am a bit of an asshole. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for not donating to a friend in need and blocking her after over a year of begging?,"I have a friend (A) who I met through mutual friends -- we interact online because we live in different states, but our mutual friend is an IRL one. A has been struggling financially for our entire friendship (~6 years) and has resorted to sex work in the past to keep afloat. 

This past year has been extremely hard for obvious reasons, and I offered to occasionally send her some money for dinner because I felt bad that she was going hungry days in a row. I'm also financially insecure, but I'm in recovery from an eating disorder so it's hard to see friends starving when I have a spare $20 to help. Unfortunately this turned into A asking for donations of up to $50 at a time for food/rent/medications, on a near-weekly basis. A lot of the time I wasn't able to help, but I sent her about $200 over the course of a few months.

Then of course I lost my job and made it clear to A that I wouldn't be able to help anymore due to that fact. The requests for money slowed but didn't stop. Finally I told A that it made me feel terrible that she ignored my boundary and continued asking for money despite knowing that I couldn't afford my own meds. This was made worse by the fact that all our other communications had stopped at this point -- we were only talking when she asked me for money. So A apologized and I dropped it, because she was always an incredibly kind friend before her situation became dire.

After months of not hearing from her, A asked me the other day for money to get a motel room. She told me she had been on the street for days and was worried she wouldn't last another night outside, so I was obviously concerned. I told her I didn't have money to put her up, but offered to call shelters/help in any other way she could think of. She turned me down and claimed the shelters were all closed because of covid, which was a lie (I called shelters in her area for her). After talking to her a bit I basically gave her all the info for the emergency shelters and how to call to get a free ride to them, and then blocked her.

AITA for telling my ex to stop the PDA at work?,"Hi. I'm 24F, my ex is 38M, and his girlfriend is 30F.

My ex-husband and I got married way too young, and we got divorced a few months ago. We work at the same company and sit across from each other. This used to be a great arrangement...lol.

He's started dating another woman at work. I try not to let it bother me, but she's always going up to him at his desk and flirting with him. They'll kiss, laugh, make jokes, and do stuff that would be genuinely distracting even if he wasn't my ex, but obviously that plays a part into how annoyed I am.

I asked my ex if he would please stop with the PDA, and he told me that it's unprofessional to let my jealousy get in the way at work. Like I said, I admit him being my ex is part of the reason it's distracting to me, but I also think PDA at work is unprofessional. AITA?

AITA for not buying an acquaintance a birthday gift?,"So in my group of friends there’s an individual I am less familiar with (Jerry). Jerry is a nice guy and we chat and get along when we’ve hung out. Every year my group of friends likes to buy gifts for each other on whoever’s birthday is coming up, as well as Christmas. Typically it’s a larger item so 3 of us (group of 4) will split the cost. There isn’t a specific cost associated with the gift we just decide what we think is reasonable. So last year for Jerry’s birthday we split a gift at a cost of $90 each, and for Christmas we split a gift costing roughly $60 each. I don’t expect equal tit for tat valuation just because it would be unreasonable to demand. As long as it’s something we as a group think the recipient would enjoy. 

My birthday and Christmas are fairly close. So when we get around to exchanging gifts for Christmas I had received a birthday and Christmas gift from 2 of my friends. Jerry decided to get everyone separate gifts this year. So the other 2 friends Jerry is more familiar with receive items worth roughly $70 and I got a $20 battery pack. Nothing for a birthday gift. I was content since I did want a battery pack and was thankful for the gift. But now that Jerry’s birthday is coming up and my other friends are asking if I want to go in on a gift again this year. I feel like saying no I don’t. I feel like an asshole for thinking of the value of the gifts but it feels like little effort was even made. So AITA?",Not the A-hole
Wibta if I asked my boyfriend to let his son sleep in his own bed,"My boyfriends son (2) and I get along pretty well. I enjoy his company and we have a great time together. His son has his own bed in our room but he puts him to sleep in our bed and I honestly didn’t mind his son sleeping in bed with us at all up until recently. As he’s gotten older, he has been trying to push me off the bed, kicking me and crying until I get off the bed (he stops crying and screaming as soon as I get up and off the bed). He does this when I try to sneak back into bed in the middle of the night as well. He wakes up periodically throughout the night and generally he’s pretty quiet and just kinda rolls around until he falls back asleep but lately, as soon as he sees that I’m back in bed he starts kicking me and screaming until I get off again. He never had an issue in the past and I have no idea what changed. We still have a great time together during the day and he likes to play with me and hang out all day but when it’s bed time, it’s a whole different story. I totally get it, he wants to cuddle with his dad and his dad only. I don’t mind this at all but this has lead me to sleep on the floor when his son is over. The floor is okay, but I’m starting to have back, neck and shoulder pain and it’s starting to get in the way of my job. His sons mom has also mentioned that she has been having trouble at night since he sleeps in bed with his dad here and he has his own room at his moms house, when he gets back to his moms house he won’t stop crying when he’s put down for bed since he wants to sleep in bed with his mom or dad. His mom has asked my boyfriend to start letting their son sleep in his own room (we have a spare room that we plan on making his sons room when he’s older but for now, his bed is in our room) a couple of times already. I love his son a lot and think of him as my own but not only does it hurt my feelings when he doesn’t want me to lay next to him (I know it’s nothing personal, he just loves his dad and that’s great) I been feeling really bad about even thinking of bringing up him sleeping in his own bed. I know my boyfriend misses his son and he puts him to sleep in our bed because he misses him when he’s not here and I feel that I don’t have the right to even think of asking him to have his kid sleep in his own bed. I’ve thought about just staying at my dads while his son is here but I selfishly want to spend time with his son too. His son is an amazing little kid and I want to be a part of his life too if possible and I’m not sure how to do that if I’m at my dads place during the time his son is at our place.

AITA for taking care of my friend's two year old?,"So my wife and I just had our first baby about a month ago. We are still getting into the swing of things but I love being a dad. My friend's wife has been pregnant with their second kid and she just gave birth last weekend. Their other child is a two year old girl. Both my friend and I are doing post grad work at the same university and we don't really know many other people in this town. So he asked my wife and I to take care of their little girl for a day while they were at the hospital cause their neighbor wasn't available. So my wife and I packed up our baby boy and dog and went over to their place. We have to take the dog because he's an indoor dog and we don't have a backyard and can't leave him at our place all day or he will eventually pee on the couch or carpet.

Once we are there we get settled in and my friend heads back to the hospital. Once their little girl wakes up from her nap she gets really excited about the baby. It was very cute, she saw him and goes ""bay-bee!"" ""cute!"" ""aww"" ""hold him!"" We took some pictures of her holding our baby and it was all very adorable.

Well apparently she thought this was her brother. Her parents had been promising her a brother for awhile and the past few days in particular. She started saying ""baybee bru-ver"" and we tried explaining that it wasn't her brother and it was our baby, but she's two and so it didn't really get through. So whatever we thought.

But when my friend and his wife got back that night with their baby and we were ready to go, their little girl started crying and screaming and didn't want us to take our baby away because she still thought it was her brother. We tried explaining to her that the other baby her parents brought was her brother but she was not having it. Then it got weird. My friend's wife started yelling at us and she was upset that we allowed her daughter to think our baby was her brother and she screamed at my wife and said we shouldn't have brought our baby. She was maaaaad. Like I assume it was some sort of post-partum depression/hormone thing but it was scary. And that upset my friend and they kicked us out of their house pretty quickly. So quickly that I had to go around the back and grab my dog. And when I got back to the car my wife was crying and so was the baby and it was all just an awful experience. 

Later I texted my friend and asked if he and his wife was ok but all I got back was a text saying ""don't talk to me."" It's been a week and we still haven't heard from them and we usually talk a lot. I'm kind of annoyed because we dropped everything to cart our whole family over to take care of their girl and now we are being treated like bad guys.

AITA for telling my SO that he isn't the stepfather of my children?,"I have four children (26M, 24F, 19M and 4M). We share the youngest child but my three eldest are from a previous relationship (they all had the same father). This March will be the fifth anniversary of their dad's passing (it was totally unexpected and was very traumatic extremely for my eldest child as it was him who unfortunately found the body of his father laying dead on the bathroom floor when he returned home from college). Obviously they now didn't have a father figure in their lives which wasn't really a factor considering that when I was in a relationship with their father I was always playing the mother and father roles for the most part because their father would go out all the time with his friends and left the parenting up to me. Yes their father was a dead beat father but because he is no longer with us and the kids are still devastated I won't have a bad word said about him. Now my elder two boys are doing their own type of thing which my SO doesn't agree on with certain things. He has said to me that he is planning on having a talk with them exactly stressing on how he feels. I've told him to leave my kids alone as he has no say on what they do with their lives but he got angry and told me that he has every right to have a go at them as he is their stepfather. I've told him that in no uncertain terms is he their stepfather as they already had a father and they don't need another one. I also told him that he is never to describe himself as my children's stepfather in their presence. He got shocked by this and said that considering we've been together six years and have a child together this more or less gives him the right to call himself their stepfather. I then pointed out that we are not married and if he were to be their stepfather we'd have to be married for this to happen. He is not taking no for an answer and told me that he is their stepfather whether me and my kids like it or not. I'm not very happy with this as another reason I don't think they need to think of him as their stepfather is their ages, I think they are a little too old to start needing a stepfather. AITA??

WIBTA is I told my boss my coworker is lying on her resume,"So to start this story off,  at a previous job I had been a manager at a call center for a few months when we hired a new manager.  This new manager was horribly under prepared for the job and spent several days crying to me as our desks were near each other.  I spent hours and hours walking her through the role,  how to make it easier in her,  the most effective ways to do her job.  This was all while our boss was stilk trying to support her her as well but it just took her a very long time to become comfortable in her new position.  This coworker told me many times that I was the only reason she stayed.  

After a few years I left to work at a better office place.  Well this coworker has since come to work at the new place.  We are now both applying for a new position, and while discussing my resume my manager mentioned this coworker was applying and how her experience in a specialty role could be a positive for her.  

Now the difficulty is I know for sure that she did not and never has worked that role.  While I left,  my significant other worked IT at the original job and kept me up to date.  Now my SO and I never disclosed our relationship for several reasons,  so the coworker does not know I had been kept up to date on her roles.

So WIBTA if I let our boss know she is lying on her resume? I am worried that it looks like I am doing so in order to keep her from getting the job that I want,  but at the same time she would need to use some of these 'experiences from her previous role' that she does not have and I have seen first hand what happens when she is overwhelmed.

WIBTA if I planned another family trip but excluded my little sister?,"She was awful on the last family vacation I planned. I planned a trip to TN for me, my bf & his daughter, and my dad, brother, and sister “Anna”. I asked if they’d like to come to pitch in $75 each. Anna insisted her best friend, “Hailey”, come, and she didn’t want to pitch in anything. So my dad paid for bro, Anna, and Hailey’ airfare, and gives me $150 for his and Anna’s share. Bf and I drive and arrive first, we call dibs on where to sleep and I explain when family gets there that bf and his daughter will take the bedroom upstairs, I will sleep on the futon in the upstairs living room, and they can sleep in finished basement. I suggest “Anna and Hailey can take the bunk beds. Jake can have the single bed, and dad can have the pullout couch.” Anna and Hailey look at each other annoyed. Hailey looks at the door to the bedroom as asks “Um..is that a bedroom?” I say “Yes. My bf and his daughter are sleeping in there.” They seemed reluctant but I didn’t really care because I didn’t invite that girl. And there is the first irritating thing that happened. Next day, we plan to visit a state park after a swim at the lake. We get to the lake and there is a kayak for guest use, Hailey and Anna just take off in kayak and don’t come back. We want to head to the park later, but their phones, bags, towels, etc. are still on the beach. They ditched without saying so and expected us to wait for them, or just didn’t care if we left but assumed we’d take care of their stuff. We took their stuff to the cabin and had to leave the door unlocked for them. Later, they were on the futon I plan to sleep in, barefoot, laying their feet on the pillow. Its 10PM and I said nicely “hey I don’t care if you guys lay here but can you just please not fall asleep here?” They tiredly say they won’t...11PM and her friend is falling asleep! I ask if they could please get up because I’m going to lay down for bed. Anna says “come on Hailey, I guess we have to go down stairs” and she groans. I see Anna’s socks on the futon. I fold them and set on floor. Anna comes back up and sees her socks on the floor. She huffs “thanks whoever threw my socks on the ground!” I say “I SET them on the FLOOR actually.” She says “whatever.” Shes actually upset, and I just go “Really? About socks?” She goes back downstairs irritated and starts playing music on her phone! I say “Can you turn the music off?” And she yells “I like playing it when I sleep, it downs out the noise! My dad says “yeah Anna, turn it off.” She shouts “OMG IS IT REALLY THAT LOUD??” My dad and I say “YES!” She turns it off. Guess what I hear again when I’m up at 2am to pee? Her music.

AITA for seeing the same psychic as my sister and the telling her how she is fake?,"My sister went to see a psychic after her friend unexpectedly died from Covid. She said the woman was real I had my doubts but I thought I would try as in I use to be very spiritual and believe in that stuff a while ago. 

I’ve researched mentalist tricks and things Fake Psychic used to manipulate or react to people such as body language along with making broad statements or giving generic symbols that people mentally force to mean something. I gave her a fake last name and the more my sister defended her the more it was clear that she was a fake. I am very angry that people take advantage of those grieving like this. She donated money (the woman doesn’t charge - I found out that goes they avoid the BBB getting them if the scam) . 

I was hopeful but after the session I was skeptical. The longer I thought the more it made sense it was fake. She said any things she sees - symbols or words were to meant something to me , I would already know the meaning OR they could show up in the future. 

She got a lot wrong. Generalized things fit easy with me having a grandmother. Most of it makes no sense unless I pushed myself to make it fit. Things only fit for my mom or sister when I asked about certain things. Logically by the psychics explanation of things - this was incorrect. 

My sister of course didn’t take the news well. She Denys it and wants to believe what she wants so I left her at that. I just wanted to protect my sister while also getting possible closure myself. I told her I loved her and we left it at that. 

I think people who do this for ego and money are horrible. Even my sisters defense was full of more logical holes than my initial ones. She says she knew 4 other people who saw her and recorded their sessions. 

I respect all peoples beliefs and religions, but I felt my sister deserved to know the truth.

Edit: I think I’m the asshole because if it brought her comfort I should of just let her believe what she wanted. She wouldn’t tell me how much she donated to her. I didn’t give the woman any money - which why I think she didn’t answer one of my last questions. I had good intentions in telling her. I’m angry she was fooled and she gave her money.

AITA for refusing to remove my makeup for Skype calls?,"Obligatory Throwaway. 

I am a 23 year old goth guy. I like wearing a bit of makeup but lack the skills to do anything really impressive. I normally stick with some simple black eyeshadow, liner and black lipstick if I'm not working. If I am working it's just a little eye liner. I tend to use some bold contact lenses and piercings to make up for my lack of makeup skills. My sister and brother in law don't really like this, thankfully though, they seem to be the only people that have an issue with it. 

We've gone back into lockdown in my country so I can't see my family in person. As a result, we've been doing family Skype calls instead. My sister has repeatedly snapped at me for my choice in makeup and has accused me numerous times of scaring my nephew. I'm not going to sit here and lie that it's never been an issue. When he was younger my nephew (now 6) was a little wary of me when myself and my girlfriend were all done up but he warmed up to it and now runs to hug us whenever we visit. Sister and brother in law then changed their angle and tried to accuse me of making everyone awkward and uncomfortable. In her words ""no one wants to join a family call and see Marilyn Manson on their screen"". 

She asked me to remove my makeup for the calls. I refused. Brother in law asked me to remove my makeup for calls. I refused. They went to my dad and asked his to ask me to remove the makeup. I refused. 

Dad is getting frustrated with me now because of this. He has no issues with how I look but I think my sister is grating on him. This is literally the only reason that I think I might be in the wrong. I don't want to have to change how I look just because my sister doesn't like it but at the same time I feel like shit. Dad is clearly getting stressed with the drama, he has enough on his plate as it is, and removing the makeup would most likely stop it. But my makeup makes me feel confident, I hate the way I look without it.

AITA for expecting my sister's boyfriend to pay my dog's vet bill?,"My dog has stomach and digestive issues. She has always had these issues and is under the care of a vet. We are not sure what all triggers her problems, but we found a limited grain-free diet keeps her happy and healthy. She is nine years old and still acts like a puppy. Her vet is satisfied with how she is. If she gets ahold of something she isn't supposed to have, I go through several days of her not feeling good, and when it's something with grains (the next part is a bit gross), she can very commonly develop blood in runny stool. When that happens, I have to take her in to get checked out, especially now that she is older.

This is something that I make very clear to anyone new that comes over the moment they walk in the door. She CAN NOT have any food that isn't her dog food or a very short list of items that are used for treats (all items are labeled with her name, and I make it clear people can give her items from those containers). I even explain why. She is trained not to take food from the kitchen or the table, but she is also part lab and will take something if it's left on the couch or somewhere else.

This is all something that my sister's BF knows. Well, he stayed over Saturday night, and Sunday morning, I found a pizza box on the floor next to the couch. It was licked clean, so I thought maybe my dog didn't get to it. But I did ask if there had been pizza still in it. He tells me, ""Oh, probably like 2 or 3 slices. I guess I forgot about it.""

I asked him why he left it there when he knows my dog can't eat that kind of stuff. Why didn't he leave it somewhere like the table and just use a plate? He got defensive and said that it wasn't a big deal since it's the first time he's done that. I told him it was a big deal and that if she got sick, I expected him to pay back the vet bill and any possible cleaning bills if my little home carpet cleaner couldn't remove any stains possibly caused. He got mad and told me that my dog was my responsibility and he wasn't going to pay anything. He then left.

My sister apologized for not checking the box before heading to bed and has said she will pay half the vet and cleaning bill if it comes to that. But her Bf still says this morning that he won't pay a bill for a dog that isn't his and called me a giant A for thinking he should.

Edit: I have realized I forgot to add an important part. In terms of training and why she is trained to not go after food on the table or in the kitchen. She sustained a very traumatic head injury a few years ago. This injury has impaired her ability to learn new things beyond the basics she already had. I have worked with a trainer to try and find a way around that but we havent had much success.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not letting my cousin borrow my favorite book?,"TL;DR I didn't let my cousin ""borrow"" my book because it means too much to me, and my family isn't happy about that. 

I (20M) am a big reader, and have a pretty big collection of books. Normally I have no problem letting friends and family members borrow my books (my sister and I are constantly swapping books back and forth). The other day my cousin Chris (12M, fake name) was over and he brought up that he wanted to read Ready Player One (He just saw the movie, and wanted to compare). In hindsight I really wish I kept my mouth shut, but I got exited and started going off about how it's probably my favorite book of all time. My aunt suggested that he just borrows my copy of the book.

Normally this wouldn't be an issue, I've leant him plenty of books before, however I don't always get them back. I usually have to remind them multiple times to please return my books when they're done with them, or just go over to their place and get them myself. I don't mind too much, because I have a lot of books, and I know that I'll get them back eventually.

Now, if I had just any copy of Ready Player One, sure he could borrow it no problem, but my specific copy means a bit more to me. I went to a private high school (Grad Class was just under 30 kids), and when we graduated, the teachers found a book that they thought each student would like, and then they all signed it. So as you can probably guess, they got me Ready Player One, and it has all of my teachers signatures and little messages on the inside.

The reason this means so much to me is that I went through really bad depression in high school, and most of my teachers were always there to talk to, and help me. So to this day whenever I start feeling down, I read all the messages they left in that book, and remember all the good memories I had there.

So after I polity told my aunt and cousin that I didn't want them to take my copy, it turned into a lot of ""Come on it's just a book"", ""You know we'll give it back"", ""He's not gonna do anything bad to it"" (I should mention that I few of my books have been returned with dog ears, small rips, or things spilled on them). My mom tried to tell me ""He's your cousin, you can do something nice for him"". At the end of the day I said no, and when they left they weren't happy with me.

My mom and dad both told me later that night that I was being really rude earlier, and that I need to apologize, and let him borrow the book (although I believe he bought his own copy now).

I know it's just a book, but I still don't want to let it go. AITA?

EDIT: First of all thank you everyone for the support! One thing I wanted to clarify is that I do not mind lending books, it is just this one specific book that I don't want to lend out. Also as easy as getting a library copy is, believe it or not, my town doesn't have a public library, regardless they can still just buy their own book.",Not the A-hole

"AITA for not serving my wife breakfast, lunch, and dinner when she demands it?","About 6 months ago, my wife and I decided to split household duties, totally her idea. I had been cooking a lot and she basically said she hated cooking and figuring out food, and if I kept doing it, she would be happy to take on the majority of housework/cleaning. We tried it and thought it went well so we kept doing it. Easy enough. Onto the issue. 

I’ve started cooking in bulk. On Saturday and Sunday I make one giant meal each day in our instant pot and portion out the remainder of the food into serving-sized Tupperware, basically meal prep. I’ve also stocked the fridge each week with lots of jellies, meats, and cheeses, and the pantry with lots of snacks and bread for quick sandwiches. 

Now, during the day, she’ll randomly come into my office and tell me “I’m hungry” and want me to make her food. I tell her all of the sandwich options and all of the leftovers that would take her 2 minutes to heat up and she’ll just roll her eyes and leave, which I think is rude.

We got into an argument yesterday where she told me I’m not holding up my end of the bargain. She wants breakfast, lunch, dinner, AND snacks served to her throughout the day. I told her that if I’m making myself lunch or dinner, I will make some for her, but I’m not going to drop everything to stand at a microwave for two minutes when she’s capable of doing that herself. I don’t tell her when I think something needs to be cleaned, you know?

Anyway, she thinks I’m being a jerk and I think she’s acting childish. AITA

EDIT: okay, a lot of people think I’m the asshole here, which, after defending myself and still getting told I’m the asshole, I’m willing to accept. New question - will I be the asshole if I tell her I want to go back to how things were, where we both clean and both cook? Thank you.

EDIT 2: I’m definitely an asshole. Thank you all, really. I plan to change starting right now. I got my ass handed to me and I deserve it, I’ve been acting shamefully.

Final EDIT: I’ve noticed an uptick in NTA comments and I don’t want anyone to get downvoted because they didn’t see my comments. We also have a newborn that she’s been doing 95% of the care for, as well as breastfeeding. I should have mentioned that in the original post.",Asshole
AITA for not wanting to have people over while I’m feeling sick?,"I’ve had a migraine for several hours now and is causing me to see fuzzy tv static in part of my eye and has made me puke, and I just want silence around me.

AITA for telling my(36M) best friend(35M) we cannot be roommates anymore.,"Backstory: Jan 2020, after a year of contemplating and planning I quit my job that I was not happy with and moved across the border to new state. Had been talking with best friend of almost 20 years and he and his wife and I agreed to find a place to split 3 way to try and save money.   


Fast forward: November they inform me that he lost his job (fired,) nothing Covid related or anything like that.  At this time as well they informed me that  they were separating. He had applied for unemployment, however has not gone through as he was fired appropriately (I assume.) I have been stuck trying to pay everything myself, though he has given me what he could when he came into any money (i.e. stimulus.)  
So currently he has no savings/income, I only have about $500 in savings, so I don't currently have extra money for security deposit/first months rent on a cheaper new place, while still paying the full rent on our old place for the final month. I have had an offer from a co-worker that I have become friends with to rent out a room in his house for $400 (all utilities included,) I currently net $2200/month. Having worked out a budget for myself, this arrangement would put me in a position that I could cover my expenses, pay off most of my debts quick(this was one of the main reasons of moving in with my current roommate) which would allow me to start saving up for a down payment on a house (2nd main reason for moving) And it would free up money that I would be able to help him out where needed(have told him he should find income based housing for now since he is unemployed and I could help cover any shortages he has.)  


He does not like this at all and says I am ""leaving him out to dry."" But he his basing everything off the assumption that he will either find a job soon or that his application for disability with go through. But I just don't think it is wise for me to enter into a year long contract with him since he doesn't have any income and I could/would be financially responsible for everything.  


But, hell I'm starting to believe I am letting him down myself, but I just do not have the finances to:  
1: Even cover the security depots and first months rent on a new place or;  
2: Be able to cover all the bills on a new place if I even did have the money for security deposit/rent. The way I figured it for 5-6 months, on my income, after all the bills were paid I would only have $200/month left over to cover food, gas to get back and forth to work, and any other surprise expenses that come up. If even one thing went wrong with my truck, we'd be dead in the water again and not able to pay bills.

AITA for not telling neighbor's guests to not use my driveway to turn around?,"I am 33, M. OK, so backstory...

We live in a salt belt state, which means icy driveways, cars dripping road salt that can damage the driveway, and cars dropping bits of ice and snow as they're moving.  We don't use salt on our driveway but the bottom of the driveway is already starting to chip due to traffic.

Our neighbor has a particular guest (40s, M) that drops by at least 4 or 5 times a week and parks in the street (suburb, wide streets with very few other people using the street).  When he leaves, he uses our driveway to turn around, even though the house he is visiting has a driveway directly across the street or he could just continue driving down the street and making a turn.

I don't even know this person's name, and they're using our driveway multiple times a week, which in the wintertime means they're dropping ice, snow, and road salt onto the bottom of our driveway.

I want to tell them directly to please stop but I also worry that this will impact my relationship with the neighbor.  It seems petty but it's driving me up the wall because I consider it rude and something I wouldn't do.",Not the A-hole
AITA for lying to my dad?,"My (25F) dad (53M) and I have a complicated relationship. Things had been trending good for a while but I can see things tilting negatively again— or atleast I got that impression from our last visit.

I had been planning to come home for a bit to visit my mom— just my mom. She and I never really get a weekend just to be mom/daughter so I thought since she’s been kinda sad lately I’d come visit for a bit.

Before I’d left, I was having a little car trouble. I went to a mechanic and I’m not very car savvy so I ask my dad by the invoice if they’re trying to scam me. (400$ charge for a break roter) He said they were, and that if I would be able to come home for a day he would fix it for me for free.

I was hesitant at first, because if I came to him while I was visiting my mom, I’d have to lie and say I was going home right after he fixed it- so he wouldn’t try to make me stay longer than I’d promised. (This is typical that he will press my boundaries of how long I can stay.) and then I’d have to lie again, and again, possibly multiple times because he doesn’t trust me. My mom suggested to do it and get it out of the way so that we could have our girls “weekend” (Mon-weds).

Since my parents divorced almost 10 years ago- I’ve never been able to do anything with just one of them. If I try to, the other is always very hurt by the fact I didn’t make time for both of them. It’s been a balancing act since I was 16, and it’s always stressful for me to a point that I’ll make myself sick over it. I feel extremely guilty doing anything with either of them if the time isn’t going to balance out.

During the time I was with my dad, he was kinda irritable, and even though we did spend some time together he mainly wanted to get the car stuff over with and eat dinner and watch a movie. Which we did. Then I said “hey I have to go, I gotta get to bed and I’d like to spend a little time with mom while I’m in town.” Immediately he says “you already spent one night with her, are you serious? You really want to leave right now?”

And it just brought back all these memories of back before and during the divorce how angry he would get, and how he would yell at me and make me feel horrible about wanting literally anything that wasn’t what he wanted. I’m honestly tearing up thinking about it. My step mom came in before anything else could be said and he tried to play it off like he was just kidding and if I wanted to go, I could go.

I left and the whole way back to my moms I couldn’t stop shaking and crying and I felt like a spineless little kid. Like I should have stood up for myself even if I knew then he would have back pedaled and told me I was being crazy, ect,.

Now he’s texting me, and asking me stuff like if I got home ok and how my breaks are doing and I feel like he’s trying to catch me in a lie. Maybe he’s not and I’m just being emotional and paranoid but I can’t help feeling both afraid and guilty about still being here with my mom.

i go in there to talk for like a half hour but if someone needs to use the bathroom they can just try the door handle and i'll be right out in five minutes. the girl in the flat says this isn't really cool, because people don't want to intrude and try the door handle if they think your actually using the bathroom. So apparently she is holding it to be ""polite."" i think she's being a pain.

she also says that i have full on arguments with my girlfriend in the bathroom and my ring volume is way up so it echoes. i admit my ring volume is at like 8.5 out of 10 but thats so i don't miss a message from my girlfriend and we have argued because she is back in india and i know the distance is hard for her.

WIBTA to demand our housemate learn how to drive already?,"He's (M, almost 30) lived with us (F 26 and M 27) for almost a year, and didn't know how to drive, has a Gov't ID and no license. No credit, no nothing. But, he got a vehicle from his parents. It's kind of a junker, and I only say that because the seat is broken, hasn't had maintenance in at least a year (if not more, only had friends ""top off"" the oil, but it mostly sat around in their driveway). I digress. 

We brought him in to get him out of his previous residence, angry drunks and fighting constantly. We made the expectation that he needs to at least learn how to drive because we can't constantly drive him around. We did offer to drive him at least temporarily since his job is a short trip up the road and I didn't work at the time. His hours required us to stay up later than we usually do to be able to get up (we're in bed and asleep by 9-9:30 for our jobs, and he gets out of work at 11 over the weekends). 

To keep it short, he hasn't made any effort to learn. I looked up some places around us, offered to take him to the classes, all sorts of stuff. I tried to teach him but I didn't feel safe with him learning because he's, well, new to it. We even have offered to let him take a month's rent if he puts it towards driving lessons, and he declined all of it. My partner and I have essentially just given up. All our friends are saying we're doing him a huge favor in giving him rides at all, and we know we are, but I would feel like such a jerk just suddenly stopping giving him rides and it would cause tension in the house that I frankly don't want to deal with.

Aita for not going to see my grandfather.,"This is a two part aita, my grandfather and I have never seen eye to eye. Growing up my grandparents loved my oldest sister and wanted little to nothing to do with me and my younger sister. Due to this we never developed much of a relationship even though I grew up going to their house every Sunday. To give a better idea, they paid for my oldest sisters college, while having to be forced by my mother to even attend my college graduation. I still tried to be civil however one day when my wife and daughter were visiting him, he told them he never really cared for me. At that point I decided I was done and ready to move on with my life.

My grandmother has since past away and he is in a nursing home. Recently my uncle died, being in the nursing home he isn’t able to leave so will not be able to attend the funeral. Although I wasn’t close with my uncle, I will of course go to the funeral for him, out of respect for his family and my father. However after, they are planning a window visit with my grandfather. I am not planning on attending. My mother and oldest sister are saying I’m being selfish. 

The second part is since he doesn’t care for me I don’t believe he has any need to have a relationship with my daughter, his great granddaughter. Again I’m being told I’m being selfish. So I guess, am I the a**hole?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I say I don’t want to toilet train our cat anymore?,"Me and my husband started toilet training our cat. Basically, you teach your cat to use a toilet instead of a litter box. This was my husband’s wish for a long time. I honestly disliked the idea, I told him I do not want to do it, as I think it will be messy. We were going back and forth on this issue for a year now. 

Recently, one of my friends mentioned how their cat is using a toilet and shared how they trained them, they said they would guide me if I ever want to do it. I told my husband about that, and he got very excited and naturally brought the issue back. He convinced me since our cat is very smart he will learn really fast. He said he will buy a new vacuum, so it will be super easy to clean the messes. Eventually I agreed and we started the process a few weeks ago. 

It’s not going great. The type of flushable litter my husband bought to use it with the toilet seat trainer has a different structure and very smelly. After cat is done I have to clean the whole room, because it’s just such a mess at this point. My husband cleans the litter, but he doesn’t touch anything else. In order for us to use the toilet I basically have to clean the toilet about 3-5 times a day. 

I am grossed out by dirty things, so few times when cleaning I had anxiety attacks.  My husband was never present (I work from home) during these. Last week I told him I do not want to do this anymore. He said it was not my place to make decision on my own, and that I originally agreed to do this, so I cannot revert back on the issue. I said then I will not be cleaning it anymore. He said he will do it. He only did it once, and the messes were “spilling to the other rooms”, I could not take it so I started cleaning again. 

Few days later when I was doing a deep cleaning of the house I had a very bad anxiety, I puked and cried. It was bad. When my husband was back I asked him if we could stop as it’s stressing me out. He said please let’s not, it’s going well for our cat. I cried and didn’t talk to him for the rest of the day. He went to the store and bought a different kind of a litter, which is not that messy. Our cat seemed to understand what is up. Yesterday, after breakfast I returned to bedroom and my cat has peed and was pooping on the bed. I let him finish, didn’t want to startle him, and then I cleaned everything out. I went and took his old litter box, put it back in the bathroom.

I think this whole thing is stressing me and my cat out. I do not want to do this anymore, but my husband said that I cannot revert my agreement back. So, WIBTA if I say I do not want to do this anymore?

"AITA: Husband is unhappy in our town, I want to wait a year so I can graduate before we move","
My husband and I are both college students, he is graduating with his master's in May, and I am graduating with my bachelor's in May of next year. We have a 1-year-old son together, and we live with my parents since neither of us makes enough money to pay for rent and other expenses. 

My husband has depression which is exacerbated by his homesickness for his home country, but he refuses to seek counseling, and while he's on an antidepressant, it doesn't seem to be working. This has an effect on me because he's been very emotionally distant and irritable with me, and in general just unsupportive of my mental and emotional needs.

My husband is convinced that all of his dissatisfaction with life would disappear if we were to just move away from my family and start living in a different city. He doesn't like my family despite them providing for our housing, internet, phone, car, gas, insurance, his student loan, ...pretty much if you can name it, they take care of it for us. He doesn't like his job (that pays very little) but has had no luck finding another job in our town. Neither of us has much social life, so we are both lonely in that regard.

I'm currently a pre-med undergraduate student  (on a full-ride scholarship) with a part-time job that I like very much. I work and study from home for the most part, which gets quite stressful sometimes because I have to try to take care of my son and get work done simultaneously. Even still, I really like the school I'm at because they're very flexible and accommodating for my needs as a student and mother.

**So here's the main conflict**: He wants to find a job in another city and move us there so he can pursue his career. I take issue with this because I would have to abandon my full-ride scholarship and try to finish my degree at a different school, which would likely take at least a year longer to finish than if I were to stay (because of credit transfer issues) on top of the thousands of dollars that it would cost us in tuition just to finish my degree. Additionally, we would have to be responsible for all of our expenses, and in a town where we have no friends, family, or connections. **I have told him that it's ok if we move to a different city for him to pursue his career, just only after I graduate in the following year.** In that year, he could find a job and save up money for us to start our independent lives wherever we decide to go. I have even said that I'm ok with putting medical school on hold if that would be necessary for him to kickstart his career. His response to this is that I am very unsupportive of his emotional needs and that I must not love him if I am not willing to do this since it would completely cure his dissatisfaction in life.

**AITA for asking for him to wait a year for us to move away?** My fear is that by moving away I would have to sacrifice everything that gives me life satisfaction without any guarantee that he will suddenly be happy with his life in a different city.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for asking my friend for a ride to campus, even though he was ‘talking’ to our mutual friend?","Hello all! ☺️

So I (23F) got invited back to my university post-grad to present some research I did in my final semester at a national convention. I live ~5 hours away from my school and didn’t have my license at the time, so I had to take a bus then a train to actually get to campus. The trip would take a total of 9 hours.

While I was still making plans for my trip, I asked my then best friend, “K” (23F), if she would be free at all while I was there so we could hang out. She mentioned she was busy with work but would let me know, and that she definitely was not free my first day there.

While I was texting another friend, “H” (22M), I realized that he lived near the bus station and was still taking class at our university. K and H started ‘talking’ the semester before, after they met through me. I normally don’t ask people for favors, but I asked him if I could catch a ride with him on his way campus. He happily agreed and it turned out that H would be going to campus around the same time I would have been boarding the train. Eventually, the plan became that he would take me, my former roommate, and her brother to campus.

The following day, while I was waiting for the convention to start, I tried to send K a message on Messenger, when I noticed I was blocked! I texted K to ask her what happened and why she blocked me —- no response. I spent the rest of the day focused on the convention. My weeklong trip passed, with me receiving no response from K about what happened. After I got back home, H blocked me as well, even though we were fine while I was on my trip. I noticed a few months later that a mutual friend of mine and K’s, “S” (26F), suddenly blocked me as well. 

K and S were my best friends at the time. There literally is nothing else that would make me think they’d want to block me for except asking H for a ride. I wanted to find out why they were upset with me so I could apologize if I did something wrong, but I’ve been blocked on everything. I’m sad because I feel like friends should talk about these things —- if they’re upset with me, I want to be able to at least apologize and try to work towards mending whatever I can.

Was I the AH for asking H for a ride? Should I have not asked, since he was talking to K?

AITA for telling someone about a racist comment someone else texted to me?,"Okay so--It's pertinent to this story that I am a white woman in a relationship with a white man. My boyfriend's mom texted me recently and the text contained a racist comment. While visiting with a friend (we'll call them C), I told C what his mom texted me, as it was pertinent to the conversation.

Tonight, I mentioned to my boyfriend that I told C about the racist comment his mom made. He got upset and indicated that he doesn't want C to think less of him or his mom. He said he is upset because I shared negative information about his mom. I told him that I'm not sorry for sharing it because his mom was the one to say something racist, and I just told my friend what his mom said. I reassured him that my friend won't think less of him because of something his mom said, as they're generally understanding that individuals are not their parents. He's pretty upset, but I don't think I should apologize.

AITA for not telling my brother why I won't spend time with my mom?,"I'm (30F) going to try to keep this post short. Basically, my mother is not a good person. It's taken a lot of therapy and a supportive husband and in-laws for me to even begin to recover from things I experienced as a child.

The biggest struggle for me is that she'll never acknowledge anything she does as being in the wrong.

Some more recent examples:

Told me the wrong time for a family dinner (preCOVID) at her house, so that I drove two hours to learn everyone had eaten without me and was mad at me for being the only one late.
The next time she told me an early start time so I showed up with two exhausted toddlers hours early and was expected to help set up, but then had to leave before the rest of the family arrived. Rinse and repeat until I started confirming times with my siblings.

Complained about my toddler nephews being ""too wild"" and ""acting out."" Then sabotaged my SILs attempts to get them to nap and tried to sneak Kool aid into their sippy cups after being told no sugar for them. Tried the same with my kids, but I packed up and left.

It's stuff like this every time I see or talk to her, plus criticism for how I look, how much I weigh, how I'm raising my kids, etc.

She has ZERO respect for boundaries and anyone who calls her out is crazy or overreacting or trying to hurt her feelings. I have given up on expressing my boundaries with her or arguing with her and just don't spend time with that side of the family unless it's for holidays or sometimes birthdays.

Here's where I might be the asshole - My brother (31M) recently reached out to tell me to spend more time with mom. Said she's depressed, is hurt because I'm keeping her from her grandchildren, is the only one we have left, doesn't have much time left in the world and I'll regret it when she dies (she has a good 10-20 years left barring illness), it's my duty as her daughter, etc. Etc. Etc. I made some COVID excuse and ended the conversation.

I have no intention of spending more time with her. I have explained to her in the past why this is but it always turns into a fight and then she ""forgets."" Do I owe the rest of my family an explanation? My (all adult) siblings still live with her and excuse her behavior as ""just how she is."" I do think she is worse with me than with them. 

It's obviously bothering my brother a lot, but me telling him why isn't going to change anything other than create more family drama.

AITA for declining to drive my girlfriends friend to her home town,"My girlfriend of three years has a friend who is 27 years old and doesn't drive. She never had a traumatic vehicular experience, she just never had interest in learning. She told me this the first time I met her. She's not incapable either. She's a certified financial accountant so she's got the brain power to do so.

I gave her a lift home last year during a long weekend as she was going to visit her family and I was going to visit my girlfriends family as well. The timing happened to work on that Friday afternoon and it wasn't an inconvenience for me at all. She also didn't contribute for gas money. I didn't ask, but she also didn't offer, nor say thanks for the lift at the end of the road trip. She wasn't really appreciative for the free lift. The road trip is roughly 3 hours long.

I listened to Sirius XM Radio on the road trip. I listen mainly to Barstool Radio, NHL Network and Fox News. I don't really care that she didn't like my selection of channels, but I'm also driving the car and paying my own gas. She complained to my girlfriend and her friends a few weeks later on my enjoyment of the Phoenix Coyotes, Tucker Carlson & Dave Portnoy. I have a sneaking suspicion that she's on the left side of the political spectrum and probably doesn't like the fact that I'm a conservative leaning person.

The next long weekend I was driving up to her home town again and she asked if she could tag along. I asked if she wanted to contribute to gas this trip and she didn't want to because she didn't have to last time. So I said you can take the bus then. My girlfriend surprisingly wasn't upset because she didn't like when she  complained to her and her friends of me and my channel selection while driving her to her home town... for free... without a thank you. My girlfriend thought it was rude to chirp me behind my back on my radio preferences during a free road trip.

AITA for yelling at my mom because she took my laptop?,"So this happened about a week ago. I am male (19), and am currently quarantining at my parents house. They had bought me a laptop for school, but not the one in this story. I am that guy who likes all the tech stuff, so I bought a laptop at a thrift store and took it home. I was staying up a bit investigating the insides of the new device and testing it.

Now I may have stayed up a bit too much until around 12 at night and my mom came storming upstairs and barged into my room when my laptop was on. She yelled something about how it was way too loud and I needed to get to bed. Now this laptop had one fan that cooled the thing and barely made a noise, it was on idle when she came up and its fan ramp up was much quieter than anything she should have been able to hear. Also, she constantly goes to bed at 4, I don't think that me staying up till 12 is unreasonable. 

I yelled at her to give me back my laptop, because I bought that thing with my money, its my property! She kept on yelling at me to shut up and go to sleep and that she was taking it for some time before I learn my lesson. I finally just yelled at her to get out of my room and she left. I still haven't got that laptop back, and she's been lecturing me about not staying up too late and using electronics all night since then. Now this isn't a problem for school, I still have the one they got me, but they took my laptop, that I had bought with my money!

I asked why he needs to do this if he wants to masterbate to porn why not use regular porn sites! He said it’s no big deal and it’s his money anyway. That’s not the point I go without things like getting my nails done because I feel bad spending money on things that are not necessary and I am not saying he can’t look at porn but he is spending a lot to interact with these girls.

AITA for refusing to go on a weekend trip with my boyfriend's family?,"My (26F) and my boyfriend (30M) have been together for just over 2 years now and it's my most serious relationship, we have a dog together and are planning to move in once both our respective leases are up in a few months. Previous to our relationship he had been in an 8 year relationship with his high school sweetheart where they were engaged after college which was ended due to the fact that she had been cheating on him for the past several years. 

The beginning of our relationship had some rocky moments as he was coming from a very untrusting relationship and had a lot of anger that he had not worked through and I was still struggling with the loss of my father from a few months prior to us meeting. We worked through it all together as well as individually with therapists etc and are very happy now. 

I get along very well with his family, minus a few stances on politics, but they are good people and very welcoming and kind. The only issue that has arisen really is that his Mom, ""Monica,"" (who has a bit of a drinking problem) has on multiple occasions slipped and called me by his ex's name. She corrects herself and always apologizes, and part of me want to understand because of habit but it has happened on enough occasions where it has become uncomfortable. Especially as there are still pictures of her hung in their house from their older son's wedding, holidays, trips etc. Again, understandable, but can't help but feel like I'm in the constant shadow of his past relationship.

His father retired at the end of last year and as a celebration, his parents are renting a cabin in the mountains where we can all get together for some drinks and relaxation. I told my boyfriend that I don't think I will be joining for the trip as I don't want to risk being misnamed constantly over a weekend that is meant to be light and fun, especially because the more Monica drinks, the more she mixes names, and I know this will be a booze heavy celebration. My boyfriend was shocked and seemed hurt that I wasn't willing to be a full part of his family, especially as his parents offered to pay for everyone's stay. I told him I wasn't comfortable being ""stuck"" with his family if even after 2 years his mom couldn't make the effort to call me by my name. (That's where things went south)

AITA: For not answering the phone after my friend cussed me and my Girlfriend out for hugging each other?,"My apologies i’m on mobile and i don’t really know how to write for others.

So my friend (M20) is a Germaphobe, and because Covid happened he has been very on edge ever since the pandemic hit our country. He also has a weakened immune system. Which is why i kinda feel like the Asshole here.

So me (M19) and my girlfriend (F19) were at my house having a good day and watching some movies. When my friend asked if he could come over. Which both me and my girlfriend have known him for years now. So we both didn’t mind. So he came over and right away I could tell something was wrong by the way he looked at us and he kinda just didn’t seem right. So i asked him but he said he was fine. So we just went back to the movie. At the end of the movie we just sorta chilled for like an hour or so. Then my girlfriend needed to leave so i got up and walked her to the door and Gave her a hug. 

And right after the hug my friend just started screaming at us. And started to cuss both of us out. And after he was done he started to cuss her out and say stuff like “Do you even fucking give a shit about anyone besides yourself?!” and stuff like that. And by that point it had been a good minute or two so i was sick of it at this point. So I told him to get the fuck out of my house. He looked stunned at what I said. Then he started to accusing me of being a shitty friend for comprising his health for my girlfriend. So i told him again to get the fuck out of my house. And so he did. I waited for like 5-10 minutes for him to leave and walked my girlfriend to her car. 

A couple of hours later he called me and I ignored his call. But he wouldn’t stop calling me so I just turned my phone on silent. And after a while I looked at my phone and saw i had gotten a bunch of messages from him and mutual friend calling me an asshole and saying i’m a horrible fucking friend for risking my friends health for my girlfriend. 

I just don’t see how I’m the asshole. Because he wanted to come over to my house and he knew that my girlfriend was over as well.

AITA for accusing my friend of being racist after she assumed that my Indian boyfriend has a small penis,"Okay, so I (F22) have this friend (F23) who lives in the same flat as me. She has been making snide remarks about my boyfriend (M22) and our relationship for a while now. Nothing too overt. Just little things every now and then. Mostly about my being “out of his league” in her eyes (I am blonde and conventionally attractive). 

I usually brush her comments off with a firm yet jovial quip but yesterday she crossed a line by questioning my boyfriend’s ability to satisfy me. I asked her what she meant and she responded by telling me that Indian men have small penises. I told her that’s racist. She told me it’s a fact. This kind of got my back up. As my boyfriend wasn’t here to defend himself, I felt compelled to stick up for him.

I told her that she’s stereotyping and that she shouldn’t make assumptions about my boyfriend as she has no idea what he is packing down there. She told me that I was being oversensitive. “It’s not that deep.” This is when I blew up at her and called her out on her persistent jabs at my boyfriend’s masculinity.
Admittedly I might have taken it a bit far by calling her bitter and lonely but I was so mad in that moment. After I was done she was just like “Whatever” and stormed off. We haven’t spoken since.

Now I’m starting to think I might have overreacted. The part that annoys me the most is that my boyfriend is incredibly well endowed (maybe a little TOO well endowed - lol) and I wanted to shove that fact in her face so badly but I bit my tongue. He was not there to consent to my sharing intimate details about his body. Besides, that wasn’t the point. Even if he were small, why is that automatically a bad thing?

AITA for not paying more toward bills because my boyfriend stays over?,"I (23F) live with 4 others (2M 2F, all early 20’s). My boyfriend (26M) stays at my place 3 nights a week, usually Monday, Wednesday and Friday. He gets to mine around 5:30pm after work and then leaves the next morning at 7am. We then stay at his Saturday nights. The nights he stays at mine we make dinner, go for a walk and then go to bed and watch some TV. My shower is terrible which means he never showers at mine and so other than charging his phone he doesn’t use any electricity that I’m not already using i.e. for cooking and watching TV. I’ve seen some similar posts where OP admits they and their S/O can be messy and leave dishes out but we’re very tidy and clean up immediately after we make dinner if that makes any difference. 

When I moved in about 8 months ago I asked if it was alright that my boyfriend stays a few nights a week and they all had no problem with it. When our first electricity bill came out (our bills are bi-monthly) my bf said he’d pay an extra €10 because he stays over often, and that just became the norm with each bill after that. (For further context, our electricity bill comes to about €200 so around €40ish each when you include my boyfriends share. 4/5 of us WFH so of course we make up the majority of elec usage). 

I thought this was a very fair arrangement but I overheard 2 of my housemates talking about how because my bf stays over so often he’s basically another housemate and our bills should be split evenly 6 ways instead of 5 and his €10 input. Bear in mind he does have his own rent and bills to pay in his own house. 

As mentioned above he really doesn’t use any electricity that I wouldn’t already be using, he gets along great with all my housemates and we never hog the living room or anything like that so it’s not an issue of them wanting him to come over less or that we’re a burden when he’s here. So AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to pay more toward our electricity bill when he’s already contributing enough IMO? If I’m NTA, should I say something or just carry on as normal? 

(Just a quick note: I know some people might comment “why don’t you just get your own place since you spend that many nights together?” which I totally get but we’re both incredibly fortunate with our current houses, both of our rents are significantly cheaper than if we got our own place.)

EDIT: Unfortunately staying at his more often isn’t an option as his lease only allows for 1 visitor 1 night a week and he lives with his landlord so there’s no leeway.",Asshole
AITA for not ordering a pizza near closing time?,"On our way home from a trip, my SO and I stopped in at a brewery to buy some take away alcohol and dine in for a pizza. The time was 3.35. I waited at the door to be seated and he hurried off to the toilet. The worked came out and said ‘you know we shut at 4pm right?’ I faltered and said ‘oh we’ll just get take away’ (alcohol only).

When my SO came out of the bathroom I told him they shut at 4pm so we can’t get a pizza (my assumption), so I bought some alcohol and we left. I was mildly disappointed they shut at 4pm but no big deal.

When we got to the car he yelled at me saying I only think about myself and asking why didn’t I confirm if we could order a pizza anyway and eat quickly, and that must mean I don’t care about him. And I also should have just ordered one while he was in the toilet.

Honestly the way the lady spoke I got the impression we couldn’t order, so I didn’t even think to ask. I know at pubs the kitchen usually closes 30 mins or more before closing. But he thinks I was thoughtless and uncaring to not even check, and that 25 minutes was enough time to order and eat a pizza if only I used my brain to order while he was in the bathroom.

Edit: I apologised for not asking about the pizza and explained my side, it was at that point he said stuff like I only think of myself. Now he’s not talking to me.",Not the A-hole
AITA if I want to keep my wedding small,"Me (29F) and my boyfriend (32M) are getting married eventually (got engaged not long ago but covid.....) I love him and I am super happy to get married. However, before him I never thought about getting married. My parents are not and most of my friends are not either (Yeah common law mariage!) He really wanted because it is important for him.

When I said yes, I asked for it to be small. I do not want all of our money to go to only one day. He agreed without a problem. He has few friends and a small family. The problem is on my side...

When my (maternal) grandmother heard about our future wedding she was overjoyed. She really does not understand why people my generation are not getting married anymore. We were discussing details about it when she mentioned invitations and I said that I was thinking mainly inviting friends. She got really angry. Her sister and her were really close and because of that we always celebrated important occasion all together. The problem is that I either do not like my cousins first degree once removed or do not care about them (I don’t dislike them just have no specific emotions about them). Thus I would rather not have them at my wedding.

Before talking to my grandmother I was even thinking not even inviting my cousins and aunts/uncles (let alone first degree once removed or second degree).

My grandmother offered to pay for the extra expenses for having them there. I feel bad saying no because I would really rather have a small wedding and if I say yes, I would feel obligated of inviting more people on my father side of the family.

After talking to my boyfriend, we ended up saying no. My grandmother started crying and said that she “had always known” that I did not care about my family.

My mother says that I should accept just to buy peace. My boyfriend supports my decision. My grandmother says she would also pay for my father side of the family if that’s the issue.

My friend, who I shall hide in the name of GM, joined the debate tournament with his team as a backup player, now, I'm going to explain the technicalities of what happened so bear with me.

Basically, he told me he was helping his team, so obviously, I was happy. But then he sent me a screenshot, and the time was 2:16PM, when the preparation time ended at 2:01PM. So in other words, GM was helping during the debate round itself, which we explicitly prohibited.

Now, it would've been fine and all if he DID help, but he wasn't able to in the sense that the arguments he gave weren't used in the round. But sadly, it was, and most of the arguments of his team came from him.

So I reported him. His team got disqualified from the tournament and he got blacklisted in the debate club and future debate tournaments.

Because of this, I did not receive either of the stimulus checks for COVID relief.

I have a lot of stuff on my walls related to that time - and this item is a framed album cover from one of the first bands I was involved with over twenty years ago. 

The band was a mix of boys and girls and they’re all featured prominently on the cover. Working with that band was one of my favourite experiences - we only made one album and neither the album or the band went far but I was proud of it. I’ve had this album up in every house or apartment I’ve lived in since then.

The problem is one of the band members -   call him Lou - well, after the band split he moved to another state and we lost touch. Recently it’s come out that he’s conned a bunch of older people out of their savings and is headed to jail. I was shocked but not surprised when I heard - he never tried to take money from me but I can see the seeds of his behaviour when I look back - he was always charming and funny but could definitely be shady at times.

I was on a video chat with one of the other women in the band, Kay, who is still a really close friend, talking about the whole terrible thing - how we just didn’t have a clue back then.

The album came up - Kay said she was never going to listen to it again. I think that’s extreme. Kay then said I should take down the cover because it’s so clearly Lou in the picture and keeping it up is like supporting or celebrating him. But I said no, it’s a symbol of a time and a place that my life that was special and Lou was only one member of the band and not even the lead singer - what about Kay and the rest of the band? I don’t think I should have to junk something important to me because Lou broke the law.  Kay thinks I’m being an insensitive asshole and not thinking about the victims.

AITA for not letting my brother use my pc to test his possibly defective part?,"My brother (26M) & I (24F) built PCs at the same time. He helped me choose my parts since at first I didn’t know much about PCs. Our builds are the same aside from cooling & motherboard. Aside from those two, he didn’t do research “just for me” but rather for the both of us.

2020 has been a terrible year for building PCs cause some parts are very hard to come by! As such, I missed a few hours of work to order our GPUs on launch morning (which meant standing in freezing temp for >3 hours)& used this trip to the store to order our CPUs which were unavailable online. My bro couldn’t order his own parts cause he had to drive his gf to work that day. I jumped through hoops to get the store to allow me to order two of the same parts (usually not permitted to avoid resell). 

Our final parts arrived Friday. I pick them up & ask if he’s coming to my house to build over the weekend. He says he can’t stay at my house long enough to build cause his GF works & he needs to drive her. I was annoyed cause I was nervous about building & thought that we would build together, but his gf is a sweetheart & I wouldn’t want to cause her trouble for my own insecurities about building. Plus, he assured me that we’re going to videochat while we build so he can guide/answer questions. I agreed to meet him halfway to give him both parts (he lives 2 hours away). When we got back we each built our own PCs. Mine works, his doesn’t startup. He’s knowledgeable in PCs & spent Sunday diagnosing & concludes that either his motherboard or CPU is defective. 

Here’s the part where maybe I’m an asshole: he asked me to come to my house with his CPU, remove parts in my pc to get to the CPU, test his & then put everything back. I told him I’m not comfortable with this since I know AMD CPUs are fragile & shouldn’t be removed once installed unless necessary. & of course there’s a risk that something goes wrong in the process. Wanting to help, I found options for him (1: bring it to computer store, they will diagnose each part for 100$ & determine what doesn’t work, 2: get the AMD free short-term processor boot kit) he didn’t like these options because they will take 1-2 weeks & if he needs to get a new CPU it will already take 1-2 months to receive it. I reluctantly said “fine you can come but my computer works perfectly so if something doesn’t work afterwards it’s on you cause I can’t afford to replace the parts”. He basically just said he wasn’t coming & that I was 100% unhelpful while he helped me throughout the entire build. Now he’s not talking to me. 

Whether I’m an asshole or not, I can’t help but to feel terrible about this entire situation so please Reddit, AITA? Or should I let go of the guilt I’m feeling? 

TLDR: my bro & I both built PCs, mine works while his doesn’t, he got upset that I didn’t want to let him take my build apart to test his CPU to determine if it’s defective.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA for contacting my mom’s neurologist “behind her back” about my concerns for her?,"On mobile, pardon any strange formatting. Here’s some info that I figure will be asked about before I get into things:


-I am listed as someone who can access her medical records in accordance with HIPAA

-My dad and her neurologist know each other professionally (its a tight nit community here), but again there has NEVER been an issue where they talk about our care without our consent. 


Now onto the issue:

My mom (59) has multiple sclerosis and depression. She is closely seen by a neurologist for her MS, but doesn’t see anyone for her depression other than her PCP refilling her meds and asking the basic PCP mental health questions. Lately (past year or so) my mom has been having a lot more trouble doing complex tasks and handling sudden changes or sudden semi-chaotic situations. Her moods also seem to change very quickly. She will go from extremely irritable and stressed one minute, to happy go lucky and head in the clouds five minutes later. She is becoming slightly more forgetful, but not with anything crucial. Just forgetting to wipe down a counter or push in a chair here and there. 

I have no idea if these issues are MS related, stress related, or depression related. But they are bad enough to worry both me and my dad. We have tried gently and sternly telling her that we are worried about her, and she brushes us off every time sayinf she’s just having a bad day. This weekend tipped things for me. I was at work while she and my dad went out to run errands. My dad went to get the car warmed up, and before heading outside gave her specific instructions on how to set the alarm so the dog wouldn’t trigger it (set it to stay, not away). My mom repeated the instructions, and then did it wrong causing the alarm to go off and my dog to panic. She then suddenly didn’t know the code to disarm the alarm, and was screaming at my dad for not controlling the dog, and blamed him for the alarm going off since she did exactly what he said (she didn’t). 

Later that day, when I came home, she yelled at me for my dog setting the alarm off. Mid sentence her face relaxed and she suddenly was calm and wanted to know about my day. It was uncanny and scary. My dad later pulled me aside to explain what happened, as I wrote above. 

I told my dad that I think she needs further assessment, and he agrees, but thinks it would be inappropriate for him to contact her neurologist since they know each other professionally. He said I am more than welcome to do so. But I’m torn. People are worried about her, but she is adamant she doesn’t need further evaluation.

AITA for asking him to stop?,"Sorry this is going to sound really stupid and trivial but I genuinely do not understand. So, I (18f) was working on an assignment (art), and I needed help on it so my bf (18m) offered me help. When he was explaining the matter, I got pieces of it, but the more he explained, the more I got confused- It wasn't helping me at all, so I asked him to stop, he offered to teach me it later and insisted to when I clearly was starting to get uncomfortable with it (I am grateful of his help and Ive told him this many times) (this was over text message)

BF: ""I tried to explain to make it easier, Ill give you a lesson on perspective later then""

Me: ""Its just confusing me more"" ""No no""

BF: ""No you need to learn""

Me: ""The more you do it, the more I get confused""

BF: ""Not now""

Me: ""Yeah but I asked you to stop, I don't want a lesson""

BF: ""Im saying later""

Me: ""Ill tell you if I need it, we spoke about this, so pls stop""

He is very adamant that I wasn’t being kind enough, that I was aggressive when he was just trying to help me, (i know he truly wants to help me) and wanted me to apologize. He says Im never grateful/appreciative of his help, which I am, and says if anyone else was offered help by him, they would be very appreciative of his help (we are in the same field, and he is skilled and experienced in this field) and that how his gf isn't grateful of his help when he went out of his way to do so for me, his “goodwill always resulted like this”, that all he wanted was ""kindness"". I have thanked him before many times, he would know I am grateful of his help, its just this time I didn't want any, I told him to ""please stop"" as I was uncomfortable with his persistence- he said it was aggressive. Earlier, I asked him to apologize because I wanted him to stop persisting as it made me uncomfortable, he did apologize, and said I should apologize as-well because I was aggressive to him by ""shutting down"" his help and asking him to stop and said I could have showed more kindness since he was offering help to me. I was anxious so I wasn't able to use kindest words when I was defending myself -""please stop"" was all.

Context, we had an agreement from past arguments on how we should ""apologize no matter what"" for the sake of the relationship, and he used this as a point for me to apologize. The issue is that previous argument was that both sides were genuinely aggressive and heated because of each other. He used this agreement we had as a point for me to apologize, when I felt that ""please stop"" was not aggressive at all, whereas as the last relationship warranted an apology because we were both actually aggressive. I told him that I felt he was abusing that statement and trying to take advantage of it when I said was surely objectively not aggressive, ""please stop"" had not reason to sound aggressive. Yes, I agree I could have been more kind about it as he was offering help, but I didn't think ""please stop"" was aggressive or unkind enough to warrant an apology.

Sounds trivial, but he was so adamant that I should apologize. AITA?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I blocked my mother after telling her I wanted her to be more present?,"This is my first (and probably only) Reddit post.

My (19F) father (54M) passed away unexpectedly in December. The funeral was a few days ago.

My mother (48F) is a problem. I live with my paternal grandparents, and have since I was four, so I haven't really had regular contact with my parents, except my dad for a few years. I saw my mom a few days after my dad passed. I hadn't seen her in three years as I went NC.

She was late to our meeting. I waited outside, and it felt like I was a little kid again- when I would wait for my parents to show up- and sometimes they wouldn't even come. It hurt me that she couldn't even be on time for this.

I made a mistake afterwards in telling her that I wanted her to be more present. I SUPER regret saying that now- as I'm remembering all the horrible things she's done. She basically abandoned me, didn't make much of an effort to see me when I was little, she doesn't listen to me, and she causes SO. MUCH. DRAMA.

Here's a list of some of the things she has done in the past month that infuriated me;

- she cried on me at the funeral home and made me comfort her
- she didn't greet my younger brother (14M) when she got to the funeral
- I had to remind her to SAY GOODBYE to my brother
- she took a selfie with my DECEASED FATHER
- she came over on Christmas Eve smelling like pot
- whenever she messages me she always has to talk about how her in-laws hate her and makes me affirm her
- she told me in GRAPHIC DETAIL about what happened when my dad died

I might be the asshole because I literally told her I wanted her in my life, and my mom just doesn't understand the gravity of the things she's done. She doesn't understand that 'sorry' doesn't make everything magically better. I know if I do this she will cry, she will be hurt, she will lose even more of her family.

But I don't care at this point. I want her out of my life.

AITA for rehoming my brothers cat without consulting him,"Please hear me out before passing judgement. 

My (27f)  brother (31m) has a heart of gold but takes minimal responsibility for things in his life. He has 2 kids to different mothers. His okdest lives with me as his mother can't take care of him and my brother has refused to, though he does stay in contact for visits. Our parents pay rent for my brother due to him living on welfare. His youngest lives with his mum but stays with me every second week to spend time with his half brother. My brother doesn't have any disability, he just can't keep down work consistently. 

Please understand, this isn't what I need judgement on, but I just wanted to highlight his irresponsibility in life through my eyes. 

My brother took in a stray kitten about 8 months ago that was hiding out underneath his front porch. This poor thing was flea ridden and malnourished at the time. He contacted me that day to tell me that he had a cat now and was keeping her so I came over to see her and bring my nephew for a visit to his dad and saw her condition.  I advised him to get her vet checked but he said he couldn't afford a vet bill. I ended up taking care of it and turned out she needed some anti biotics and special food to help her survive. I bought these for him and gave him the instructions to take care of her. I know he is irresponsible but he has never outright neglected something in his direct care, he just hasn't been willing or able to sacrifice any of his time or money to see to the needs of others.

I made sure to swing by a week later on my own to see him and see how  the kitten was doing. My brother had given her only half of the medicine she needed and had dumped all of the food in a massive bowl for her to graze on as needed so it was probably mostly stale.

 I just made a snap decision then and there that he couldn't take care of her. Once we were done with our visit, I scooped the kitten up and put her in my pocket and I drove her to a good friend of mine who fosters animals and she is now being taken care of by her and will be ready to be rehomed once she is better. 

My nephews have been asking to go see their dad and the kitten so I told them that their dad is no longer taking care of a kitten. My brother called me two days  later to ask if I had left the front door open when I left as he couldn't find his cat. I told him I hadn't and he concluded that it must have run away. I let him believe this and said nothing.

Am I the asshole for rehoming it and lying? I feel like I may have overstepped with making a decision on his caregiving abilities without at least giving him a chance. And I lied to him and I told my nephews a half truth.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not lending him my charger that second,"I have a very tense relationship with my family, well that may be an understatement. Tonight I was in my room and my brother told me he needed a charger, I was using mine so I told him I’ll lend it to you after I’m done. Not satisfied with my answer he started getting angry because I wouldn’t just let him charge that same second, so I told him I am choosing to lend it to you after I am done, I don’t even have to do that. He started saying that I was throwing a tantrum and that he was going to ignore that, and I responded how is this a tantrum, I am just using my charger. And then he responded telling me my life will always be shit, how I will never have anything good in my life, that god is punishing me and that even if I find someone to marry me that I’ll never have kids. He knows damn well that is a huge insecurity of mine because I have a health problem that makes it harder to get pregnant.

AITA for asking landlord,"Been living in this house for a while, shared with a few other people. Landlord likes to lay down bizarre nonsense like ""Just because your rental agreement says you can use the kitchen doesn't mean you're allowed to use the storage space, the appliances, any power conduits or the floor"" and ""A third of your room is marked as SHARED space, which means it's mine to use."", or the one that triggered today - 'YOU are not to change any appliances, so much as a single light bulb.' Today this came to a rather unpleasant head when I asked landlord to please install a light - one he's been promising to install for a week now - upon being asked to, he basically exploded. 'I never agreed to put up anything, how DARE you gaslight me like this'. I ask if I can put up the bulb myself then - 'DONT YOU DARE OR YOU'RE GETTING THROWN OUT! ONLY I AM ALLOWED TO CHANGE DEVICES!'. Fine. I ask him for that, in writing... ""HOW DARE YOU!? I NEVER SAID THAT! GASLIGHTING ME IN MY OWN HOME!?"" aaaand... yeah.

I don't know what the hell I did, or why he's so violently angry. According to other housemate, I'm in the wrong because I should know contradicting the landlord on anything is gaslighting them.

Aita for taking a bit of weed out of my girlfriend’s grinder?,"I’ve been arguing with my 2 buddies over this. One thinks I didn’t do anything wrong and the other thinks I did. Here’s the story:

I was running really low on weed when my girlfriend came over. She has her own weed and will let me use some if I’m low. I even asked her before this if I can use some because i don’t have much. I have also shared with her many times, we kind of have a sharing mentality when it comes to weed. 
She left her grinder in my room, which is a very big big grinder, about 3 times the size of mine. She asked me to run down and get it for her. I went down and noticed it was very full, and since we are on weed sharing terms, I took some out of her grinder and put into mine. I took about a bowl and a half worth. So it’s not like I took a gram plus from her or any high amount. But she left and I didn’t specifically told her I put some of her weed in my grinder, but figured it would be fine because of past agreements. 

One of my friends told me what I did is the equivalent to “taking a few singles out of her purse when she’s not looking”, which I totally disagree with. The friend who is on my side said if it hasn’t been a big deal in the past it shouldn’t be an issue. So Reddit who is right here?",Asshole
AITA for describing a dream in which my husband came out as gay as my “worst nightmare”?,"I (29F) have been married to my husband (25M) for around 2 years. For some reason I’ve been having some (unfounded) anxiety around us splitting up but that’s a conversation for another time.

I had a dream a few nights ago in which I caught my husband having sex with a man and when I confronted him, he told me that he was gay and that he never actually loved me and he was leaving me.

I woke up the next morning with a sick feeling in my stomach until I realised it was all just a dream however for some reason it really shook me up.

Cut to yesterday when I was talking to my best friend, Peter, (29M) who is gay. Things were going great until I described the dream and told him that it was my “worst nightmare”. Peter became really angry with me and accused me of being homophobic and hating gay people. I tried to tell him that i have no issue with people being gay but when it was my own husband and that he left me, it made me extremely upset. Peter just hung up the phone and text me shortly after calling me an asshole.

I don’t think I’m the asshole as I was only trying to open up to Peter about my anxiety and described the dream as a way to do that but when I told another friend about what happened and she said I was insensitive to describe anything to do with being gay as a nightmare.

AITA: Mother blew up at me for bringing a friend over.,"This was a few years ago when I (18m) at the time had a few days to myself to relax towards the end of the year. My friend (also 18m) was going to leave his home to live in a share house roughly 4 hours away and we wanted to catch up one last time before he left and have a gaming session.

Now here's the issue. He'd already packed all his things, so going to his house was a no go. But my mother (50f) is anal about having the house absolutely spotless and being aware of whenever there are going to be guests over days in advance so we have to time vacuum and organise the whole house.

I didn't want to go behind my mother's back so I tried to ring her on her mobile as she was at work. Nothing. Shot her a text. Still nothing after a little while. I even tried my Dad, who is usually chill about this, but still nothing.

In the end I caved and told my friend to come over for a few hours, thinking it'd be fine since he would be long gone by the time my parents finished at work. I was wrong.

They came home early and found me and my friend playing games together. My mother smiled, put on a happy facade and spoke to my friend about how life was before politely asking him to leave.

Minutes after he left, she blew her top. Making comments like, ""The place is a mess, we must look like disgusting pigs now"", ""I've failed as a mother"", ""you've become a fkn delinquent"".

I tried to explain the situation, but she ordered me out of the house and told me not to come back until she texted (3 hours later) because she was distraught and needed the space from me, telling me to reflect on my actions.

I felt terrible about it at the time and was given the cold shoulder for days even after I'd apologised, but looking back I can't help but feel she overreacted.",Not the A-hole
AITA for suggesting to a morbidly obese friend that she ask her doctor about Adderall?,"I'm a former obese person who has successfully recovered from Binge Eating Disorder thanks to success with Adderall. For those of you who don't know, Adderall is sometimes prescribed as a treatment for BED due to its appetite suppressing side effects (as well as other effects that often contribute to weight loss). For me it's practically been a miracle cure to my obesity. I’ve been losing 10-15 lbs a month from the moment I started taking it, and now I'm officially out of the obese BMI range after just a few months on it and I'm at the point where even if I don't take it, my cravings are under control.

One of my friends-we'll call her Leela- is morbidly obese and very dedicated to the myth that it's virtually impossible to lose weight. Leela has a BED diagnosis, which she rejects even though it's clear to anyone who goes out to eat with her that she definitely was not misdiagnosed. She will eat *easily* over 5000 calories in a single meal. She strongly stands by ""intuitive eating"", which she misconstrues to mean eating whatever she wants as much as she wants (edited to correct my own misinterpretation of what intuitive eating is).

Yesterday, our circle was having our weekly Zoom and Leela brought up the new CNN article debunking the ""fat but fit"" myth. She began to complain about how impossible it is for her to lose weight and got really defeated and said ""I guess I just have to accept these health issues are very likely for me and come to peace with that."" In response, I opened up about how helpful Adderall has been for me and I suggested she consider asking her doctor about it. She just started at me, said ""wooow"", then exited the Zoom.

The other girls proceeded to tell me I really fucked up. I asked them what was wrong with presenting a possible solution that I'm having success with when she was complaining about the potential health ramifications of her weight. They said that I essentially just admitted I agree with Leela's doctor that she has an overeating problem, which she wasn't ready to hear. This morning, I got a text from Leela saying she won't talk to me until I get my ""unhealthy obsession with weight loss"" under control and accused me of ""disordered eating"". She blocked me on everything and a friend sent me a screencap of a FB post she made saying ""Wow. One of my best friends just told me I need to do drugs to lose weight. This must be how those poor models pressured to do coke feel.""

I think this is a huge overreaction and I can't compute how she doesn't see the difference between a medication prescribed by doctors to help obese people get to a healthy weight vs. underweight people abusing coke to stay underweight. My friends say I'm in the wrong and I should have kept my mouth shut, but I feel that's just cowardly and enabling her. What do you guys think?",Not the A-hole

I don't think my sister needs that in her life, and quite frankly I'm done dealing with it even if I want my father to continue to have even a false happiness in his really unfortunate life.

"AITA for telling my husband if he doesnt come home at a decent time, not to come home?","I have been married to my husband for 4 years. Things were great up until this year where we made atleast 1 day a week to solely spend together. This year however, has been a mess. We didnt really get to be locked down as while he was home(hes back to work now), I was busy with my grandmother, and my 2 younger sisters. I am my grandmother's caregiver so I didnt have a choice but to (happily) continue to go over daily to care for her. With my sisters, the youngest, Ava, had issues after her youngest was born with health problems. I was taking care of her oldest while she was at the hospital and her husband worked. Finally for the past 3 months, I have had to help my other sister, Mary, after the birth of her child. She is a single mother with ppd. Here lately it's been worse as she has been hospitalized with post partum psychosis. Sundays, every week, my husband goes to his parents for football. As you can imagine, this leaves little time for my husband and I as he works full time and only has the weekends off.

For the past few weeks, my husband and I have planned a day for just us as my birthday was yesterday. We weren't going to do anything fancy. Just order Ramen from a local shop and play video games all day. I 100% didnt want to deal with anyone else as I have been stretched so thin, I'm close to a break down. The day didnt start great. My sister was hospitalized again and she needed someone to pick up the baby and take her to our other sister. I told my husband plans would be on hold for about an hour or 2. Things didnt go as plan and I ended up having to spend 2 hours speaking with CPS. I messaged my husband that he should find something to do as it would take awhile. I didn't get home until 5pm. My husband went over to his friends house while I was gone.

When I got home, I let him know and this is where the arguement starts. He had been drinking and wanted to finish up what he was doing with his friend. I was pissed. When he is with any of his friends and drinking, I'm lucky if he comes home before 3am. I snapped on him telling him it was my bday and if he didnt come home at a decent time, not to come home. I locked the door and tried to fix my day. He ended up stumbling in at 5 am the next morning and I made him sleep it off in his car(he didnt drive, friend lives a block away). We are now in a huge fight because I was a bitch to him and wouldn't let him sleep in the house

Edit/update: after typing everything out and after a drunken phonecall from my husband, I have decided I'm not doing this anymore. I am contacting a lawyer in the morning to start on a divorce. I may be the AH for what I did but now he can stay with his parents and be the alcoholic he wants to be until they get sick of him and kick him out.

AITA for not covering a shift on my one day off?,"I (20f) am a full time preschool teacher on top of being a full time college student currently online due to COVID. When I interviewed for the job, they promised me I could work any 4 days a week and that I wouldn’t close every night so I could get home early and do my homework. I was very very clear about this and they agreed. 

Well, three weeks after I started, they took away my day off and promised they’d hire someone else to help within a month. Fast forward 2+ months and I’m still working 45+ hours a week when they promised I wouldn’t be. I became very burnt out and told them I need them to give me the day off that they said they would. 

When I did this, they told me it’s a big ask of me and that they don’t like being taken advantage of, but that they don’t want to lose me so they’d do it. I was upset because I was promised it in the first place and wasn’t taking advantage of them?? But whatever as long as it works out!! 

Well Saturday night, one of the teachers who is really flaky and always lying, not coming in at all, or is hours late texted me to say she didn’t feel good and needed me to cover her 9 hour shift Monday (today). I had had a mental breakdown this weekend and truly needed my day off, so I said no. I know fully that this screws over my bosses and other teacher bc they will all have to work a little extra to cover her without me.  But also they refuse to hire more people. 

I feel like a complete asshole because I’m watching them text each other in the work group chat the plan to get through the day without the other teacher, but I also can’t help but feel like it’s not my fault they have the bare minimum hired. None of us are even allowed to stay home sick bc we don’t have enough people. If I had covered for her I would be stuck working a 9 hour shift with no chance at all to do my schoolwork for the week and I know they wouldn’t let me have another day off. 

I know they’re all mad at me and the rest of the week is going to be filled with comments about how “you weren’t here Monday” and how bad it was. I feel like a complete asshole but part of me thinks it’s not my job to cover for others on my one day off that I -need- to do my schoolwork for the week since they make me close and I basically have to come home and go straight to sleep after every shift bc being a preschool teacher is mf tiring.

AITA for posting the unedited photo of my influencer friend and I?,"My friend “Elsie” is super into social media, particularly Instagram. She has a lot of followers (like 60k) and mostly posts pics of herself but sometimes posts pics of herself with friends. She’s still in uni but wants to be an influencer. Elsie also edits her photos. A lot. She uses Facetune to make her waist and arms smaller, her butt bigger, and her nose smaller (she's shown me). I don’t really care that she does this (tho I don’t think it’s great) but what really made me mad was when she posted a facetuned picture of the two of us. She had photoshopped her waist in the photo, but in doing so she had made my waist and part of my arm look bigger. I probably look 20-30 pounds heavier in the picture than I actually am. She posted it yesterday and it got around 2k likes, and I was not happy. I texted her asking her to take it down, and she refused. She said “noo, you look cute!!” I asked again and she still refused. I was very mad. I waited about an hour, til I knew she had class, and then I commented under the picture. I commented: “see my story for the before pictures!”  I made my account public and on my story I posted the original, unedited pic of us. A lot of people viewed my story; way more than normal, and a lot of the viewers were strangers. I also got quite a few new followers (I don’t care, this is just for context). When Elsie saw my comment, she was furious with me. She deleted my comment and the picture (though that wasn’t until 3 hours later) and texted me a long paragraph berating me for what I did. She said that she had lost followers and was getting comments about the photoshopping. A small-ish account that exposes influencers had even picked up the photos and reposted them. I sent her one text saying that I can’t control people’s online behavior, and that while she can facetune herself, she shouldn’t facetune her friends. I sent another text saying that I’m sorry she’s so upset but that I didn’t know what else to do. My other friends think I’m in the right, but they also were never huge fans of Elsie to begin with.

Edit: Elsie is not even overweight or anything, though she's not small. She tends to make herself look a lot more ""hourglass"" if you know what I mean. According to our other friend, Elsie and her bf are currently in a fight (though he knows what she looks like so idk if it's to do with this). She is currently not talking to me. I forgot to say that part of why I'm wondering if I'm TA is because I left the unedited pic up for 24 hours after she asked me to take it down (it expired this afternoon). She deleted the edited pic, but I left the unedited one up on my story.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not talking to my parents' friends??,"My (16F) birthday was recently. I originally planned to go to out with some friends however COVID hit and I wasn't able go through with those plans. However I made a backup plan to invite them over the Saturday after my birthday and I had discussed those plans with both my friends and my parents. Fastforward to New Years Eve where I had to attend the New Years Party of one of my parents' friends. My parents have two pairs of friends, both married and are middle aged Filipinos, like my parents, however I'm not very close to either pair. I minded my own business since I was the only one there who didn't speak Filipino and who was a minor. Then I overheard my parents inviting their friends over to my birthday party which they would be having the Saturday after my birthday. I objected saying that I had made plans with friends and I had even told my parents about them. They laughed it off and said that what I said was ridiculous. Later on our way home, they started chastising me for ""being disrespectful"". I objected once again saying that it was my birthday and even though I was their daughter that doesn't mean they can go and plan my own birthday. They replied that because their my parents they could do whatever they please and that I should ""respect my elders"". I had to cancel all my plans with my friends and the day of my ""party"" I stayed in my room and refused to come out except to eat lunch with their friends. My mom came into my room and said that they're only having the party because one set of friends had invited them on Christmas and the other set had invited them on New Years and since my parents hadn't invited them over for anything, they thought my birthday would be the perfect time to celebrate. I told her that I'm not coming out of my room because I didn't want guests in the first place and I have no interest in talking to people I barely know let alone are comfortable enough to have at my birthday party. My mom said i was acting ""standoffish"" and rude and left. After their friends left my parents sat me down and said that I was grounded for not ""being attentive enough to the guests"" and I said that I shouldn't be even talking to them since I didn't want to celebrate with them in the first place. It's been two days since the party and my parents have been ignoring me the whole time, only talking to me when they want me to do a chore for them. I feel sort of guilty but at the same time I don't. I know I'm only a 16 year old and I should respect those who are older than me and I was extremely sarcastic with their friends who were at least trying to talk to me and I regret being that rude to them. However I'm a very introverted person and talking with people who I'm not very familiar with makes me anxious. Soooo AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling someone that when will I get married is none of their business?,"There a lot that needs to be said here, but I'll try to keep it short. I'm a 25 year old man and my fiancée and me have been together for 10 years now. Most people who know we've been together this long usually say things like ""Oh, that's a long time. Why aren't you married yet?"" or ""Oh, why are you leading her on?"". Always, directed at me, even if we are engaged.

Here's the thing, we met in high school and have been together since. The reason we aren't married yet, is that we DECIDED that we'll only get married once both of us finish our educations. While she already finished hers and has a job (she's a civil engineer), I decided to take a different route into medical school.

Thus, my time studying is considerably more. I've got into medical school at 22 after college, and in my country, the medical school consists of six years. Which means I'll graduate in 2024.

We are quite happy with this arrangement as we'll be spending our lives together regardless. However, people constantly saying stuff like that takes a toll in my mind.  Well, a few days ago, we were talking with a couple of our friends, and the wife of a buddy of mine, ALWAYS makes sure to make comments like that.

That being said, I was not having a good day already, and she said ""Oh, you've been engaged so long! Zealous, why aren't you married yet? You keep leading her on and she's gonna get old you know!""

This is the actual quote. Honestly, I can't really say I was a nice person after that. As some would say, my vision turned red. I bluntly told her ""Please, shut the f up. It's our marriage and our life. If you have enough time to care about our life, please go f yourself.""

Yes, this was an absurd behavior and I know that I shouldn't say this kind of things to people. But I couldn't help myself, it was the first reaction that came out of me. Now, while my fiancée is without question by my side as she says that woman was way over the line, some of our friends are calling me an asss-hole. 

Saying I should apologize for my rude behavior and that she was only making a harmless comment. Honestly, I know I shouldn't have been so rude, but I can't bring myself to apologize to that woman. Just the thought of it makes my blood boil. 

Anyway, I wanted to ask people who aren't involved to give me a opinion. Was I the asshole here?",Not the A-hole
AITA for feeling this way about my dad?,"I am 20 years old, I came from abroad about 6 months ago to study, I don’t work at the moment because it’s extremely hard to find a job here at the moment with what’s going on around the world so I completely rely on my dad.

My day to day responsibility is to clean the apartment clean everyday pretty much, but my dad has some insane standards when it comes to cleaning it. 

I can leave a curtain slightly open just a little bit while I’m cleaning and he can turn into a huge problem and I’m not sure why it becomes a big deal? I might not clean some dirty while cleaning the apartment and if he sees this he calls me over just to pick the dirt up or whatever it is and clean it in front of him? He almost pretends like he’s the perfect one and I need perfection quite literally.

I could accidentally leave something in the incorrect place and he’ll call me over to fix it and it’s extremely disrespectful in my opinion. Almost like he wants to ridicule me for making minor mistakes, or like I’m his servant?

So basically I was tasked to clean the apartment to the highest standard today because he has a meeting tomorrow. I did clean the apartment to the best ability I could and then I went out to help my friend build a booth we’ve been working on for months now. I come back late, about 12 am. He sits on the laptop as always because that’s literally his only life.  I greet him, he greets back angrily.

Asked me what time I went out i tell him at 6 and he disagrees saying I’m lying? To which I assure that’s the time I did go out? He then ignores it and doesn’t say anything.. literally acting like a f*cking child.. I ask him “you’ve got that meeting tomorrow right?” He answers with “you didn’t clean anything, everything is dirty you did nothing”.  I disagree saying I did clean the house and i at least spent an hour cleaning it. When I came back he literally doesn’t clean after himself... there was dishes on the counter,  his empty milk bottles with tissue laying there? If I did that He’d give me hell, and he doesn’t feel embarrassed that I’m the one who comes back just to clean after this weird grown man?

What really pisses me off is his 0% of honesty I feel like at least. He can tell me what the f*ck I didn’t clean instead of being a little bi*ch? I hate his behaviour because now I’m left wondering what I did wrong? I cleaned everything, I didn’t mop because I didn’t feel like there was a need to but he gave me no hints as to what is wrong? Literally just said “you didn’t clean the toilet at all nothing  is”, he makes no sense to me, I clean like this everytime and 1 day it’s fine another day there’s a problem...

Update: he woke me up early in the same mood as yesterday saying “you don’t expect me to invite anybody with the toilet this dirty do you?” I said what’s dirty about it can you tell me? Instead of showing me? He’s shouting like a brainless animal pointing at random dirt on the floor that either I’ve not cleaned or was done overnight..

He left saying he’ll be back to clean it himself after work, I said “tell me what exactly is dirty I’ll do it no problem” he just left so now I’m left checking every spot for dirt and wondering is he going to complain about this too..",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to listen to my mom talk about her dating life and taking my stepmother’s side in a dispute?,"I (20M) have a complicated relationship with my mother (55F). She was very clingy and overbearing when I was growing up, and she didn’t let me have much privacy or freedom, and as my parents’ marriage was largely loveless, she made me essentially the emotional replacement for my father; she went to me for company, support and love, and didn’t see a problem with things like us going to dinner without my father, or me sleeping in their bed (father worked night shift until I was a teenager) until I was 12. Looking back, we had a very unhealthy and even inappropriate relationship. Additionally, she is a very unreliable person in the sense that she will spill all of your secrets to others, and can switch from being excessively caring to vengeful and critical in a second. I also have trouble trusting her because when my parents were divorcing (during which time I was also dealing with a major medical issue, acclimating to a new school, and settling into a new house on the other side of the metro area), she was a nervous wreck and forced me to support her when it should’ve been the other way around. Finally, even to this day, she engages in counterproductive behavior such as giving me “helpful tips” i.e. telling me how to do basic things that I already know how to do and constantly nagging me about appointments, events, family birthdays, etc., and starting political arguments in which she automatically assumes I don’t know what I’m talking about because of my age. She recently started dating again after my father remarried, and she brings it up every time I talk to her (about once a week). Up until now, I just stayed silent, as I have a lot of issues with intimacy and romantic situations as a byproduct of the dysfunctional environment I grew up in that I am working through in therapy. But I couldn’t take it anymore. She was talking about how she can’t find a high quality guy at this age, and I finally told her that I didn’t want to talk about her dating life, and that she should save it for her friends. The second issue is that my sister moved into a very nice rental property owned by my stepmother at a discount (she and her fiancé are in a bad neighborhood and don’t have much money), but on the condition that my mother couldn’t enter the house. She was furious about this, and I responded by saying that it’s her property, and she’s justified in not wanting her husband’s ex near him, as he will be frequently visiting my sister. She said that I was an emotionless iceberg and ungrateful for her sacrifices (newsflash: there’s more to being a parent than just paying the bills), and that I should want to listen and take her side because it’s the “considerate thing to do”. It is true that I put up emotional barriers against her as a result of her volatility and untrustworthiness, but I think I’m completely justified in not wanting to hear about her dating life, and recognizing the validity of my stepmother’s wishes.

WIBTA if I chose not to wake my boyfriend up for work?,"He sets multiple alarms and then wakes up just enough to turn each of them off. After all the alarms, he falls back asleep, counting on me to come wake him multiple times before he finally gets up. I really dislike being put in this position. It makes me feel like a nag, or the parent of a lazy teen. I have brought it up several times that it's frustrating for me and I don't like doing this but he refuses to see how it's an issue and continues counting on me to do this.  Would I be the asshole if I didn't try to wake him after his alarms, which would likely cause him to be late for work?",Not the A-hole
AITA for allowing my fiancé to be at my house while I’m on the phone?,"When my daughter, Avery, was 17 I started dating my then-boyfriend (now fiancé) Steven. I had been friends with him for a little bit of time and Avery had met him once and said that he seemed nice and was “into me.” Guess she was a good judge because a year later Steven and I got together and the rest is history. 

Avery’s relationship with him has been... rocky to say the least. I have two sons but they were adults when I got together with Steven so didn’t have much input. Avery was a minor and we are very close so she was always around and began disliking Steven for no reason. 

She said he was being rude to her when he was only giving her helpful tips. She would comment on my relationship with him too and how he treated me which I thought was inappropriate. They can never see eye to eye when it comes to issues pertaining the world which I don’t get into because I don’t have the knowledge. What I will say is that Avery is only 21.

Steven has always tried to be kind as can be but she still just doesn’t like him. The other day I had her on speaker while Steven was in the room and he heard her ranting about some boy so he gave her some pretty solid advice but afterwards she got quiet and said she had to go.

I thought she might’ve just been disappointed to hear the truth from a man’s perspective but later on she called me asking why I hadn’t told her Steven was there. I said that I told her Steven was at the house that day and I had told her that she was on speaker so I don’t know what she expected. She said that I should have told her that he was in the room but just don’t agree. Steven and I are a team and he shouldn’t feel like he needs to announce his presence when just walking around.

She then went on a tangent about how I’m a coward and always take a man’s side and how she doesn’t respect me because of that. I told her that he was my fiancé, not just some man, and she was being absurdly rude. I did tell her I wouldn’t put her on speaker anymore though and she said don’t worry about it because she wouldn’t call me with her issues anymore. Then she hung up and hasn’t spoken to me since. My sisters and parents think I’m in the right while my sons are both pretty mad at me too (they are very protective of Avery). I’m just confused. Was I the asshole here?",Asshole
AITA for not wanting to be closer with my brother,"So I (24m) have a younger brother (22), and our parents are always on me about how we aren't very close. To put it simply, we just don't like each other or get along. Like, I actually can't think of a single thing we have in common, food, music, hobbies, we are polar opposites in everything. Anytime we are forced to interact it always ends with us either just existing next to each other without saying anything, or we end up butting heads. Beyond that, its a kind of open secret between that that we both have personal grudges against each other (I hate that he was our parents favorite to a cartoonish degree, and he hates that I'm one of the smartest people in the family while he can barely do single digit addition [not a joke, ask him 2+2 and he'll reach for his phone]).

Anyway I went off and watched some Netflix whilst I waited but after 3 hours of hearing him laugh I went to find him and he told me he had got his friend to get the game so he can’t play anymore.

I was making biscuits for myself in the oven, so I didn't want eggs. I told him to grab the canola oil and spray the other half of the pan. He does. He then cracks his eggs into a bowl and whips them, then starts to put salt and pepper on them. I said, ""You shouldn't put that on the eggs before they cook, that's how they get grey."" He finishes putting salt and pepper in the raw eggs, which is whatever to me, they're his eggs, so I don't say anything else. We continue to cook. He pours the eggs into the skillet. After a few minutes I remove the sausage and he finishes up his eggs. He puts his eggs on his plate and starts to walk to the sink. I say, ""don't put that in water yet, that's why it's warped."" He gets angry and tosses the pan back onto the stove top. I said, ""Why the hell did you just get angry at me for that?"" He replies, ""You just keep coming at me!

WIBTA If I don't answer to my brother ?,"First of all, english isn't my first langage I'm sorry !

Quick background : My (25F) dad was sick for 4 or 5 years, he had a cancer and unfortunately he didn't make it.
My mom was struggling financially and I did everything I could to help her, unlike my older siblings (39M and 38M). My siblings always called me to take care of my nephew or if they wanted something (I can have free underwear where I work), but never answer when I called them for my mom and dad.

Before my dad passed away my mom and I used to go see him and, you know, ""say farewell"".
My siblings didn't and when I called them to say he passed they told me ""Oh, ok""

I know some people don't show emotion so I didn't mind.

Fast forward to today, my brother try to call me, I didn't answer because I was working.
He left me a voicemail saying ""When your brother call, you better pick up and don't let it go to voicemail""

Honestly, I think about cuting ties with them. They don't like my boyfriend, never invite us or talk to us except when they need it. I remember a day were they told me I wasn't wanted by my parents, I was 7.

AITA for telling my mother to leave and never come back?,"
I know this sounds bad and it probably is but I need some outside perspective. Sorry for mistakes I’m on mobile. 

I [15F] didn’t have the best upbringing. My mom has bipolar and it presents with narcissistic tendencies. Note she also has Lupus. She would either ignore me for her computer growing up. To the point of yelling at me for interrupting her to tell her about my day at school to the point I stopped telling her anything. Or she would endlessly criticise me about everything, my grades, my weight... that was her favourite. To the point I barely ate anything. Oh but don’t worry, she was just joking. She would lie about everything or gaslight you about things if called out. She would yell at me “what do you want?” Every time I left my room, even to go to the bathroom. She held a grudge against me for a week because I needed to go to the hospital and she wanted that cab money for McD’s. These are just the tip of the iceberg that is my mother. 

My dad on the other hand is a hard worker. Works himself to death at a labor intensive job so he didn’t get home till late and once he did she would twist things so I always got in trouble every time I’d try to call her out. 

At some point I don’t remember clearly what happened but I was at school and had a panic attack. I talked to my school councillor who got my family theorist. (I don’t know if that’s the right term). I’ve been diagnosed with depression and general anxiety.  He’s helped me see a lot of what was going on wasn’t ok. I know CPS was called at some point because I was telling the teacher that I didn’t want to go home over and over but nothing really came of that. 

Well of course the spotlight can’t be on anyone else, so one day my mom got checked into a hospital psych ward after she had a her own mental break. I didn’t see her for a couple months. 

In the mean time my dad really started to understand what she was like. I can proudly say they are separated!

But now for why I might be the asshole.  About a week ago we went to a therapy session with my mom at the hospital. Doctor thought it would help. I sat there for an hour while my mom did this whole woe is me speal about her lie. Which made me realise that she doesn’t just lie, she lies so hard she convinces herself that she’s telling the truth.  I don’t want to get too in detail about what was said but at some point I laughed, and laughed hard. And the dr asked why I was laughing. And I just started just laying it all out. Everything she did, said, (like how I should get back with my first bf cause no one else would love me, I was 14, or all the cruel comments that she said were ‘jokes’) I just laid it all out. At the end I told her I wish she’d do us all a favour and just leave and never come back. Before walking out. 

My dad hasn’t said anything about it but he’s been really gentle with me since. But now that I’ve had time to calm down and think... I may have gone too far. AITA?

Edit: I just got back from a short day trip with my dad (keeping safe) and my phones blowing up, I wish I could hug all of you because you all made me feel validated that these feelings of anger  I was having were ok to have. Because I kind of felt bad because she’s my mom you know? But it’s like a cycle I think...  but no. It’s time to break that.

AITA for lowkey threatening to call CPS?,"My friends and I (a paramedic, a preschool teacher, and a nurse) go to this karaoke bar all the time. The upstairs is a bar and the downstairs is a restaurant. They're wrapping up a birthday party so there are balloons everywhere. A few min in, we see these kids running around. They're twins, both 6. It is 11pm. We assume they're with the birthday party and will be leaving soon. They're sweet and my friend and I help them gather balloons to play with so they'd stop climbing on stools to reach (they would not stop climbing on stuff despite the staff telling them to stop). So the big bday party group leaves but these kids are still here. I dont really mind because I like doing Disney karaoke anyway. I sang the pokemon theme song for them too. But it's after midnight and these kids are STILL HERE. The ""mom"" ends up sitting with us at our table. I'm bothered, but I like to mind my business. My other friend is not dealing well but we're determined to have a good time and not cause a scene. I'm over at the bar and the bartender is trying to get the attention of another patron cuz their cocktail was ready. Guess who! So now I'm like, okay these kids are running around after midnight in a bar AND their mom is drinking. The grandpa (her husband) has a beer in his hand too. My friend is completely distraught because these kids are so young and this isnt a safe environment for them and their parents arent sober. So I make it my mission to get them out of there cuz my friend is crying at this point. So the grandpa comes over next to me and asks why I dont seem like I'm having a good time and I play ignorant and say that I'm just so worried about these kids and being a mandatory reporter, I was wondering where the parents were. And he's like ""what? I didnt hear you?"" And my other friend catches on and we both say in unison very loudly ""WE'RE MANDATORY REPORTERS."" And he then says they're getting a cab. The ""mom(?)"" is drunkenly like ""we can just walk home"" (IT IS NEGATIVE 18 DEGREES F OUTSIDE) but the grandpa had some more sense and said that no, they were getting a cab. And they left. 

So like the grandpa took them in after idk what happened to their parents so they wouldnt have to go into the foster system and the woman was his wife (also she was 21 and he was like 50). They were nice people and I feel for the situation and all. But it's not like I *actually* called CPS on them, I just scared them a little into hopefully making better decisions from now on. My coworker says I was being an asshole, bullying them out of there, because bringing kids to bars is legal in Alaska so they weren't doing anything wrong. But the kids were upsetting the staff, my friends, and all the other patrons. Yeah they were ""supervised"" but their guardians werent sober so I wouldnt call that ""supervision."" I dont feel bad for what I did but my coworker insists that I was in the wrong. Could she be right?

AITA for having what felt like a mental snap over a markdown list being missed,"Obligatory on my phone so sorry for formatting, also sorry for grammar and spelling errors. 

To start I work in a plus sized clothing store, it was late night trading so we were open to 9pm, my break was at 6pm cause I had been there since 1pm.

On Thursday at my work it was discovered that a markdown list was missed on Monday, I told the manager before she left that I'd deal with it for her, she said thanks and reminded me to finish hanging a bunch of dresses before I started the list. I nod, she leaves, I get to work. I barely make a dent in the clothing pile when my coworker comes in for her 3 hour shift, I'm busy dealing with customers and put backs when I hear my coworker tell a customer ""I don't know, I literally walked in through the door"" in an annoyed tone. I stop what I'm doing and go help because that is not how we should be answering customers, after I stepped in my coworker tells me ""I'm not here for another 10 mins"" and she walked out. 

So I'm now stressed, the pile of dresses hasn't really gone down, I haven't touched the put back list yet and my coworker is in one hell of a mood and I'm going to have deal with that too. Coworker comes back, I ask her to work on the dress pile then start the markdown list and I head off on my break. I come back an hour later, there are still some dresses that need hanging which is fine, it's late night trading it might have gotten busy. I decide to start work on the markdowns and feel bad as I start pulling lots of items out of the wall as the manager had spent the last 3 days doing a full store visual merchandising flip. 

I'm getting steadily more annoyed at myself for long it's taking me to do this list as I only really had from 7pm-8pm to do this list as I'm meant to stop at 8pm to clean the store. So I started to grumble a bit at how annoying it is that the manager missed the markdown list on Monday and it just escalated into a mini rant as I got really worked up over it. Cause the manager missed this list, our regional manager missed it when she was here in Monday, I missed it on Monday, the part timer missed it. I was annoyed at myself, I was annoyed at everyone who missed this sodding list, I was getting annoyed at my coworkers bitchy attitude, I still had to close the store my coworker on did the vacuuming leaving my to try and get the dusting, mopping and store closure done on my own and yeah.

I know I shouldn't have been ranting, I know damn well that I should have just kept it to myself. But I didn't, I let myself spiral into a completely unnecessary rant, I got so worked up over something fairly small and I want to know do I need help or am I just an arse? I ask because it's turns out that the coworker I was with on Thursday called our manager and told her that I was bitching and ranting about her and the fact that she misses this list.",Asshole
AITA for asking my mom to not cook food that I'm allergic to while I'm making dinner?,"Hi. I need some input here. I am 21 and live at home, I am in college full-time. 

I have a severe shellfish and mollusk allergy, which includes all crustaceans and mollusks (shrimp, crab, lobster, clams, scallops, squid, mussels, octopus, snails, surimi). I have an anaphylactic response where upon ingesting it my throat begins to swell and my airway begins to close, sending me to the hospital. If I even touch shellfish or a trace amount gets into my food I will react and become swollen with hives- for example, I can not eat fried food at restaurants that share fryers with shellfish, can not eat food cooked on a grill that had shellfish cooking on it, can not touch it, etc. 

My mom has a nut allergy and does not react to smell or touch, only if she eats it. I eat very few nut products besides a sealed nutrition shake (comes in sealed/locked individual bottle), have only ever had a PB&J out of the house, etc. If I ever do cook with or eat nuts I do so when she is not home and disinfect my area afterwards. 

My mom loves to cook shellfish for herself for dinner, and I have no issue with that. The problem is, if she is making shellfish I am not able to prepare any food for myself. Most days, I am fine with waiting for her to be finished and the area to be clean. For example, last night she made herself lobster and I did not begin to make myself dinner until 10 pm. I did not complain during this time as she was there first. This evening at around 6 pm I began preparing myself a chicken and vegetable stir fry with rice. I had my chicken thawed in the sink, and was chopping up all of my vegetables and turning on the rice cooker. She walks in and says she wants to eat and is gonna use a ""small space"" to make herself some more lobster. Right away, I knew this would be an issue- as my chicken was sitting right there and since she was next to the sink everytime I needed to clean my knife or place a spoon in the sink, she would say, ""ugh, i have to move again."" I needed to wash my hands and she said I was getting too close to the lobster so I said I had raw chicken on my hands and needed to wash my hands. 

By this point I had enough and asked her if I could just finish preparing my food because it is too difficult to avoid cross contamination and getting the lobster proteins all over my ingredients. I was in the kitchen first and would be able to work quickly if I wasn't constantly having to navigate around this. After this she told me it was her kitchen, and I said, ""Okay then, I'll just go take a nap I guess. I always wait for you to be done but whatever."" She ended up storming upstairs and calling me names, including a f!!!!!! c-word. 

I cried for a minute than finished up making my food. I just don't know how to remedy this. I can't control the fact that I have a life threatening allergy and don't know if I'm TA or not for simply asking her to allow me to finish my task before she contaminates the space and makes it too dangerous for me to work and eat in there.",Not the A-hole
Aita for returning what my dad got for my birthday,"Disclaimer this happened when I was 12 and I keep thinking about it.

(He didn't take the price tag off and it was $15) his excuse was that what I wanted wouldn't ship in time and I can build whatever I want with what he got me. I was grateful but I never use mechano and I'm not into it and I didnt want it to sit and collect dust, so I told him. He said he'd return it and get something else but that still hasn't happened. Stepmom rolled her eyes and made a stink about me not being grateful and made me feel bad.

WIBTA for practicing my religion in my home?,"So my brother, his wife and their child have come to town recently for reasons that aren’t relevant to this. They couldn’t find anywhere to stay on short notice so our parents suggested they stay with me and I agreed, since I live alone in a two bedroom house.

Anyways, my brother and I were raised atheist but after marrying his wife (a fundamentalist Christian) he went pretty hardcore in to religion. This is where problems arise, because for the last 6 years I’ve been an active practitioner of Heathenry (Norse paganism, for those unfamiliar). This ended up causing problems. My hearth cult (an altar, essentially) is in my living room. So I went through my near daily routine of making an offering and saying a prayer without even thinking about it. My brother and his wife have been in the room a few times while I’ve been doing it.

Yesterday, my brother asked me if I could hold off on doing anything religious for as long as they are staying (which could be as long as a month). I asked why and he informed me that his wife is apparently worried about staying in the home of someone who “worships demons” which isn’t even a remotely accurate description of my faith.  He also told me that it apparently scares his kid, which honestly I call bullshit on. I’m pretty sure he just said that to try and guilt me. 

So, WIBTA for continuing as normal?",Not the A-hole
AITA for blowing up at my mother over her religion?," 

Hi there, I'm feeling incredibly guilty, but I don't know if it's misplaced guilt.

My mum has always been a devout catholic, but growing up her Catholicism was at least within the boundaries of what might be considered normal religious practice (praying at night, going church on Sundays etc.)

last couple of years though she's taken to consuming a lot of online religious media, specifically she's found a Brazilian religious channel called 'Cancao Nova' (we're Portuguese) which is pretty much just 24 hours of pure preaching, and she also watches a lot of YouTube.

I came down the other day and she was watching a pair of priests on YouTube having a discussion amongst themselves about Armageddon, essentially suggesting that the state of the world around us is proof that its coming soon. My mum started insisting that I sit down and watch it with her, preaching the usual crap about how I need to shape up or be lost etc.

It absolutely incensed me, for so long she has been like this and I feel like we are losing her, she doesn't listen to reason, she just genuinely believes everyone who isn't catholic is 'Lost' or living in squalor.

I blew up at her, tried telling her to stop watching this stuff, that it was essentially manipulating her and making her a resentful and bitter person. she's the archetypal catholic, the whole world is going to hell because of gays, and abortion and so on and so on(even pointing to my sisters divorce which irritated me more). She came back with her usual retorts about me being lost, and needing to find god and all that. I asked if she would stop watching this stuff, just for a month to see if she would feel better, she out rightly refused, even refused to acknowledge the request. I told her she was an addict, and that she was close minded.

Later I found her visibly upset after the argument and has stayed distant even days after. I tried apologizing for blowing up, but she seemed distant and disappointed.

My mum always had a knack for guilt tripping us growing up, giving us the disappointed and disapproving face and lectures when we didn't want to go church or go around a relatives house or something like that. but I don't know this feels different, this feels like I attacked her core or something. It's only because I care so much about her, she's my best friend and I feel like she's only a turn away from becoming a fanatic street preacher.

for the record, this isn't the first time I tried talking to her about this stuff, but its never lead anywhere and sometimes just felt like its not worth the effort, though as I'm typing this I fear that's part of the problem.",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to cook for a week when my husband enables our picky 6 yr old?,"TLDR: I’m sick of cooking for a kid who doesn’t want to eat it and a husband that enables her.

Hello good people of Reddit! I’m 40, husband is 45. Only kid is just shy of 7. I cook like a gourmet chef but often make simple things (like a roast chicken). I also make healthier riffs on things like “nuggets”. I just don’t publish they are tilapia and not chicken. My kid will eat random things separately (ex: would demolish a jar of capers or olives if Id let her). My kid eats almost zero of what I make. She used to eat more things, but tastebuds change. My husband has cooked maybe 3 times in the 8 years we’ve been together. I don’t fault him for not cooking (he doesn’t enjoy it and isn’t good at it...I knew that when I married him!). I fault him for enabling our child to choose to not eat what I make, spit out what I make. And then she gets a peanut butter sandwich because my husband lets her. I’d make her go to bed without dinner. This has been the case since she was 2.

I grew up in the mid 80s in a low income family. You ate what you got or you didn’t eat. Every dinner where I try to get her to eat what I cook is an argument because she barely takes a third of a bite before spitting it out and stating she doesn’t like it. I get mad because I try to set a good example of a family who cooks and eats together, with lively conversation that doesn’t include complaints about the food. My husband folds immediately and gives her a pb sandwich, yogurt, etc. And then one of us has to get up and make it for her and then we get less time to interact. I said they can fend for themselves for a week because no one seems to appreciate what I do. Even before covid I cooked 6 nights a week. Now 7.

Additional info: no, she has no allergies or stomach issues, but she’s in the 5th percentile so she’s tiny, which makes my husband feel like she should get whatever she wants to eat. She is VERY heathy and her doctors don’t have a problem with her weight.

Other info: I make over $400k a year (my husband has made as much in the past, but we flip flopped this year due to covid and someone needing to stay home while school was out and natural progression of my work). And yet I find time, all 5 weeknights, to get a healthy dinner on the table by 6pm. 

I’m sick of the enablement of the kid to just not eat what I make and 6 nights a weeks (when I didn’t make homemade pizza or something of similar complexity), that dinner is an argument. AITA to just say I’m done cooking and they can figure it out on their own?

Edits: 

1) I have involved my kid in the cooking process. I let her help stir, chop, etc. she will help prepare things that she has no interest in eating. She might stick her finger in a sauce and say, this taste good, but then won’t eat it later.

2) I have never forced her to go to bed hungry. Not when she was 2, not now. She’s not starving. She eats all day.

3) even when I cook things that every other kid in the world loves.. Mac and cheese, lasagna, tacos... you name it. She mostly won’t eat it. 

4) this is not a new convo and my husband and I have talked rationally, til we are blue in the face and don’t agree. 

5) she has no texture problems. She eats jello, the occasional bite of caviar, marshmallows, etc.

6) she likes raw vegetables with nothing on them better than cooked. So she gets those.

7) all of this just essentially leads to the fact that I don’t have the time, nor patience, to basically prepare two separate meals each night. Even if that involves just microwaving something. 

8) yeah.. Cause no other parent out there has prepared tilapia and told their kids it is chicken.

Second edit:

1) no tantrum here. This is 5 years in the making.

2) I have NEVER once forced her to eat what I made if she didn’t like it.

3) I do give her deconstructed versions of what I make. Chicken with the sauce, salad components versus all mixed up. It doesn’t help.",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting a new phone after finding out I am pregnant?,"So I am pretty sure I am the asshole, but let’s get into it anyway. I found out last week that I am pregnant. After losing my mind for 3 days planning and prioritizing a things that needed to be done to the house, I thought about me. I wanted to get something for myself as a kind of reward because my husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for 2 years. I don’t NEED a new phone but I recognize that this is the last big thing I can do for myself in a long while. I have a 7 year old who is home full time, and I am 100% responsible for his schooling. My husband is also home full time but he works full time too. Meanwhile I have to take care of my son and husband but I am expected to cook 3 meals a day for everyone, keep the house clean. And work on the endless list of things to do that my husband gives me daily. I just thought it might be a nice gift to myself before I add taking care of a newborn full time into the mix. My husband said I didn’t need a new phone, and if either of us got a new phone it should be him, as he has an iPhone7 and I have an iPhone8. He will not talk about financing a new phone. He says we have far too much to worry about besides phones and that I am being selfish. I told him ok I will let it go. Am I the asshole?

Edit: I realized that I had left some information out. I contribute to our finances. I receive monthly payments from veterans affairs for disability that is more than enough to cover the mortgage and my share of the bills. There is usually enough left over to send over to my husband. Since my money is our money and his money is our money. I could buy a phone outright with what I have left of my monthly earnings in one month.",Not the A-hole
AITA for confronting my friend with his lie ?,"Hi ! I (22F) have been close friends with V (24M) for 4 years. We get along really well and know the best and worst of each other. 

V has been a liar for a long time. Which he knows, has told us (close friends) many times and definitely dislikes about himself. Over the years, he's gotten better. He lies over little things that don't really affect anything, most of the time. Other times, he'll lie about bigger things, like lying to his manager about the amount of hours we worked for example. Overall, it's never lies that harm others, it's mostly things to make him look better, more interesting, and number exaggerations.

So today I was just talking with him and for some reason the topic of brushing teeth came up. He mentionned how he does it everyday, to which I responded ""No, you don't"". For a bit of context, V basically stayed over at my appartement with my roomate (close friend of ours) for 3 months. Over that period, I noticed that V just never brushed his teeth. I remember noticing every night after that, like ""looks like V didn't brush his teeth again"". I never told him about it because I just don't care, and it's not my problem anyways, but I noticed it nonetheless (bathroom os next to my bedroom, I hear everything). Long story short, he insisted again and again that he did brush his teeth and I just didn't hear it. I tried telling him that it was okay for him to just tell the truth, that I don't care whether or not he does it, I just don't want him to lie to my face like this and try to make me believe stuff that I know perfectly well never happened. I told him how it's just impossible for me to fully trust him when I have proof like this that he keeps lying. I'm tired of doubting everything he says, I want to trust him, I want him to get better because he knows he has that issue and wants to work it out. He told me he was very hurt and stopped answeringy messages. After that I told him that I do not wish for him to feel ashamed by all this and I do not have ill intent. I said that if I knew how to help I'd do it, and I know that swallowing a lie like this is not a way to help.

He already goes to therapy, but I don't know how it's going. I do not wish for us to cut ties either, I love him. 

Considering the way he reacted I'm supposing I may have been an asshole, being way to direct and harsh.

AITA for stealing the spotlight at my best friend's wedding?,"So two days ago, my best friend contacted me to be her wedding singer. The original one cancelled on the last minute because he had a tonsilitis, and the wedding would be tomorrow (yesterday). So I accepted it. I can sing but I'm into upbeat music, so I asked her if it is fine to sing pop. She said she actually prefer it if I'll sing pop music. She even requested to make it explosive that she will suddenly forget she's being married.

So since she's a Kpop fan too, and I recently just learned a new one, along with the choreography, I decided to perform that instead. It is called ""Can't Stop Me"" by TWICE. It is a high and loud song with very hard choreography.

So the performance happened. I gave it my all. I sang energetically and showcased my explosive dance moves. Her groom, however, didn't like ir. Actually, most of the visitors, who are mostly the groom's relative, didn't. His mom even scolded me in private, saying I ruined the solemnity of the event.

My best friend apologized because she didn't expect that her in laws and husband would hate it. But I think it is her right to ask for the song she wants because she's the bride, but then, the groom is also a part of this, and he also deserved what he wanted.

AITA for not letting my dad be apart of my kids life?,"This all started when I was around 14/15, my sister who was 31 at the time had a kid, and me my dad and my mum were talking about it, then my dad comes out with ""if he has autism he isn't my grandkid, don't want some autistic freaks in my family"" he then goes on to say that ""if any of yous were autistic I'd make sure you didn't come out of that hospital bed""

This completely changed how I saw him as a person, I already knew he hated me (I'm a bi male, he still doesn't know but he talks about how he hates the LGBT community)

So fast forward, I'm now 26, my wife delivered a healthy baby boy, however my dad said he was gonna come and visit us to see the baby, I knew my wife didn't want him up (they 2 had a rocky relationship) and I didn't want him up either, our son was healthy however I didn't want my dad seeing him because well, what if my son grows up to be gay? Or what if he has mental health isuees, I really don't want my dad to see him, so when he came up I told the hospital we didn't know him and he got sent out, I tried explaining to my family why (even came out to them) but they all took his side

Wibta for leaving my family soon?,"To preface: I (27f)  live with my mom, sister, and nephew in a 3 bed/2 bath house. I stay in the bonus room above the garage. I moved in last year because my job laid a majority of people off in my department and I had got sick and was in the hospital for about a month (right before covid got really bad in the US) so I was getting behind on bills. My mom let me move in and we would split the bills 3 ways once I got back on my feet. It took another month to fully get healthy again and I begin doordashing and instacarting until I found steady employment, which I have and been working since August.

As I said, the plan was to be splitting the bills three ways but my sister has since quit her old job and took a job paying significantly less so I’ve been paying the full amount of rent ($1,400) since September and half of the cable ($140.) I also have my own bills such as car payment, insurance, cell phone, vet bills etc. so I’m having to DoorDash and Instacart again. My mom has been paying half of the utilities, water, half of cable and trash, and their cell phone bill which totals to approximately $650. My sister pays the other half of utilities which is approximately $150 and whatever my nephew needs; my sister also gets SNAP benefits so that covers food. I buy most of my food because I can’t eat beef, pork, or gluten.

Other than the money issue, there are a few annoyances that occur: my sister and nephew don’t ever clean up after themselves so I have to always clean the kitchen and living room. My mom and sister smoke and drink in the bathrooms and will be in there for hours so I’ll either have to wait, go to the gas station, or hold it until I get to work. I asked if anything, can one bathroom be free when I wake up for work so I don’t have to hold it and I won’t smell like smoke and they always say ok but they always “forget.” 
My sister will buy me wine and I’ll put it in my mini fridge, then when I come home from work it’ll be gone because I didn’t “drink it fast enough.” I’m not a big on alcoholic beverages so I might have a glass here and there. There’s a few more but those are my biggest problems which seem petty but after awhile it gets old.

I’ve found a 2 bedroom townhome for $880 with water included that will be available mid-march and I’m considering putting the fees towards it today. I hate to leave them like this and they really are a great family and I’d do anything for them but living with them is driving me insane.

AITA for ‘promoting veganism’?,"I’m 27m from England and now lives in semi rural USA. It’s not where I thought I’d be after uni but I had a friend who had a small business so I got in on the ground floor. For the most part, I enjoy living in America and my job. 

However the trouble comes from the fact where I live, hunting is a huge part of the culture. Now, the hunting season is still way off but a few of the other management staff at my firm are planning a hunting retreat when the season begins. As senior staff, I was invited but I kept declining. 

They kept pestering me saying my excuses (“I’m busy” or “I might be abroad”) weren’t good enough and that they’d work around my schedule so we could all go. However, they kept nagging and I kept refusing. Eventually they asked the ‘real’ reason why I kept saying no, so I told them. 

I said that I find the idea of killing anything terrible, never mind just for sport and I wasn’t comfortable doing it. I mentioned I was by and large a vegetarian (I will occasionally eat meat, maybe once a year if I have no choice) and most of the time my diet is vegan. I also said that as my parents are Indian I was raised a Jain, and while I’m not exactly devout, non violence and sanctity of life are major tenets of that. As a result hunting and killing animals is something abhorrent to me. 

Well, this was poorly received, and I’ve had various responses, mostly to the tune of how good meat is to eat and what fun hunting was. A colleague asked me sarcastically “I bet you think it’d be great if everyone was vegan right” to which I replied that for moral and environmental reasons that yes, it would be better. 

This had the effect of me being branded some sort of radical, but really it’s the first time I recall even mentioning diet in the 5+ years I’ve worked there. Sure, people probably guessed I was vegetarian from seeing the lunches I brought in but I can honestly say I’ve never tried to persuade anyone to change their diet - that’s their business and no one else’s.",Not the A-hole

I said 17:00 coz i wanted to play hypixel skyblock dungeons with friends. After copule hours he walked to me again and just said 16:00 and i did not even said anything. 16:00 came and i told him that i need to do a important presentation as i could fail for 2 reasons: Not having it and Not explaining things to class. So i went, did it at arround 18:00 and played a while when i let my bro go at 19:00. He played and when ended he took his keyboard and chair.

I told her I'm sorry she's upset but that it's not my fault and she can stop following me into the kitchen and should try to get support, not hassle me.

"AITA for ""flaunting"" my life on social media?","A few months ago my boyfriend and I (28F) moved across the country to a larger city for his job. It's a great opportunity and it'll allow us more freedom financially to build our future, but I didn't anticipate how lonely I would be without my immediate support system. I'm very social and being a plane ride away from my friends and family, not to mention trying to make friends and navigate life in a new city, really did a number on my mental health. I was in bed for almost a month straight and spent a lot of time crying.

My boyfriend and best friends back home have been very supportive and are really trying to help me adjust. My hometown friends connected me with some of their friends in our area, the BF and I are making time to (safely) explore new places, and we're thinking about fostering dogs since our new place has more room and it'll keep me from being lonely since I work from home all day. He and my best friends have been encouraging me to share about our daily life on social media for our friends and family and it's really cheered me up!

I (22) wanted to study language ever since I was younger. I’m interested in a variety of them but admit it’s not the best outlet when I have health issues inhibiting the process. Often times I have to take long breaks which make it difficult to learn and am only very beginner in a few different languages. I have studied Russian, Korean, French, Spanish, etc. but am by no means good or solid in them. I am technically able to understand Spanish but cannot speak it.

He’s very close the the definition of a weaboo and I just don’t want to help him if he’s going to act like he knows everything about a culture he’s only interested in for anime/games/etc. I’m not saying it’s a bad reason to learn a language because I think expanding someones horizons and learning a language is always a good option but I don’t think he’s going to be nice about it.

He gets upset when the language has other ways of saying one thing (such as ‘Is that right?’ / ‘Yes’ / Alright ) even though I have given him many examples of that in English. His go to reaction to anything is fighting and being aggressive and I honestly don’t want anyone to deal with that. He’s made some worryingly racist comments in the past so this isn’t new.

My roommate started dating this guy (22m) in December 2019. He’s also super nice and I’ve never really had any major issues against him, but there are things that bug me. Primarily, he is ALWAYS at the apartment. He has his own that is 5 minutes away, but he hangs out at our apartment like it is his own. My roommate will be at work and he will be there just hanging out for no reason! He has a job but doesn’t work many hours so he just hangs out at the apartment. He’s really great but I pay a lot for my rent and I’m hardly home alone. 

I feel stupid for complaining for the following reasons: 
-he mostly stays in their room when my roommate is gone
- he does a lot of cleaning (nobody asks or expects him to, he just does it because he’s kind if a neat freak) 

Reasons these things bug me:
- he puts away stuff I frequently use in places I can’t reach, and constantly rearranges the kitchen to make it the way he likes
- he will take my random and small amount of clutter (a couple of pieces of paper, some pens on the coffee table) and will put them by my door on the ground even though I don’t necessarily want that stuff moved because it’s my apartment and I want my stuff left where it was if it’s not in the way!! 
- I just want to feel like it’s my roommate and I’s apartment and not the three of ours.

I have talked to my roommate about this and it bothers him too for similar reasons. He can never find things in his own bedroom. He also couldn’t care less if my pens are on the coffee table or if the wine glasses and the ugly plastic drinking cups are on the same shelf of the cupboard. He has tried to set this boundary with this boyfriend but BF doesn’t listen.

So the issue: her cat; likes to shit in the tub. I didn’t mind that much at first, it’s disgusting but at least it’s not on the rugs. I would clean it if I was showering and it was there, whatever. 

Well I’m sick of it now it’s just gross. She gets home before us and is home hours before and just leaves it, doesn’t bother, and cries for my fiancé to clean it all the time for her. 

She will breakdown if my fiancé says no. *tears and all* I’ve told her if she cleans the cat litter every day like you should( instead of when it’s too full of piss and shit) she would probably use it. She has three cats so it gets filled fast but it sits for at least a full week and a half no cleaning. 

I’ve completely refused to clean it now and ask her nicely if she can clean up after her cat. She does but she likes to tell me the entire time how tired she is that she worked all damn day why should she clean it. Mind you, she has an office job 8am - 5pm and I work in a warehouse from 3:30am - 2:00pm. She’s now complaining to my fiancé, calling me names, and he’s been getting mad and tells me to just suck it up and clean it. She even called me childish to my IL’s while we were at dinner. (She sees both me and my fiancé as children but that’s for another sub) 

I might be the asshole because I now let the cat shit sit and don’t pick it up at all and wait until she gets home to tell her since now I get home before her.

AITA for calling out my grandma over my OCD,"I suffer from severe OCD, the invasive thoughts kind

I've been suffering greatly with it for over a decade now, most commonly are disgusting thoughts such as bugs and poop crawling in my mouth and throat but it does manifest in other ways

&#x200B;

About 5 years ago it began to really effect me involving water, if I'm not purely focused on the act of using water my OCD comes along and mentally taints it

Be it the idea of snail slime in a bottle of water or a colony of flies living in my taps

These issues can persist for hours and sometimes days

Naturally it's not real, I know it's not, but my brain is unable to tell that it's not

&#x200B;

A simple solution, all I need is for someone to not distract me by talking to me

&#x200B;

Everyone who I know has been informed of this and I make sure to clearly say before I interact with water that I'm about to and I make sure to remind people that I need a bit of quiet just for a few seconds

&#x200B;

Now you have backstory and information on my condition;

&#x200B;

My grandma lives near by so she sometimes comes to help out with issues my OCD can't handle, like taking out my rubbish bins

We keep telling her she doesn't need to because my brother is being paid to do that for me, but she insists on showing up to do it anyway

&#x200B;

Yesterday she was at mine

I needed a moment to wash my hands, so I asked for a moments quiet, and as she has so often over the five years, immediately started bombarding me with questions the moment I put my hands under the loudly running water

&#x200B;

She knows very well about this issue, and due to me always giving ample warning before I use water in any form, has effectively been reminded of the issue every single time we've met for the last 5 years, often multiple times

But this happens constantly

&#x200B;

Naturally this lead to one of the aforementioned panic attacks

I have emergency medication however due to someone sharing one of those damned memes lately with the spider jumpscaring, I had to take the emergency medication earlier that day to prevent one of my main panic attack triggers (see the insects above) and as a result wasn't able to take another one within a reasonable time frame

This one was a bad one that persisted the whole day, the tap was tainted in my mind as were my water bottles, leaving me with nothing to drink, and heres the most important part; unable to take my anti-depressant/anxiety medication last night, leaving me unmedicated today

&#x200B;

She called today I mentioned all this

&#x200B;

Her response was ""Well, I hope you're happy after blaming me for everything""

I responded ""I'll be happy when you can get your head around this one simple concept after 5 years of me begging every time I see you"" to which she hung up the phone on me

&#x200B;

As mentioned I'm off my meds so I'm anxious, stressed and I dunno if my judgment has been impaired

So am I the asshole for calling her out on this?",Asshole
WIBTA if I didn’t give back my friend’s cat?,"In November 2018 my friend was going to Australia for a year. However she couldn’t bring her cat with her right away so she gave the cat to her sister. Fast forward to February 2019 and the sister can’t take care of the cat anymore so she asks me to take him. I say sure, and I’m told it will be for about 6 weeks and then my friend is going to fly him (the cat to Australia). 6 weeks comes and goes and I still have to cat. Every other month or so my friend messages me saying she’s almost ready for her cat to come to Australia, but nothing ever happens. (Not that I’m complaining at all, I love having him).

It’s now December 2019, and I still have the cat. My friend is back from Australia. She asks to come over to see him, and I say of course. When she gets here he runs away as soon as he sees her into my room. She stays maybe 10 minutes and then leaves. She says she’ll come get him soon. 

Cut to March 2020, and I haven’t seen or heard from her since December. I run into her at the mall one day, and she says she’s ready to take him back, and that she’ll message me with details. Lockdown happens, and I haven’t heard from her since. 

I love having my cat. He’s a part of my family and has been for almost 2 years. He has a new routine, a new favourite food, and basically just a new life. Even though I haven’t heard from my friend about her taking him back since March 2020, I’ve decided when/ if she does ask for him back I’m going to say no. Yes I went into this knowing she would want him back at some point, but I’ve just developed such a connection with my cat that I would be heart broken to give him up after so long.

AITA for not wanting to give more chocolate to my dad?,"Last Friday was my 21st birthday and I got two exact same boxes of chocolates from my cousins. [A picture of the chocolates for reference](https://images.app.goo.gl/YgFe8N4e9iWmHEZn8) The first box I got on Friday and the second on Saturday. My sister's birthday was the week before, and she had also gotten a box of the same chocolates. My sister gave each of us in my family (mum, dad, and me) 3 Ferrero Rocher. So when I got the first box I did the same thing.

Then, on Saturday, I got the second box and left it in the kitchen for everyone to eat, since I wasn't going to eat two full chocolate boxes. I told my family they could have all the chocolates from the second box and kept the remainder of the first one in my room.

Yesterday, my family finished the second box. Today after lunch my dad asked me (not very nicely) if he could have a chocolate and I said no and explained that they had already eaten the ones I gave them. I continued to explain that the ones I have I am saving and eating one every day because I don't want to eat them all in one sitting. 

My dad got very mad and started to tell me that I am so selfish, and he doesn't want to live with a trash selfish person. I don't think as myself as selfish since I had already given them a whole box. Also, he continued to say that they sell more chocolates in the supermarket and if I want more I can just go and get more. I told him that that applied to him too, and he said that knowing there are more in the house he doesn't feel like going to the supermarket. He does this with every food. He has previously finished a full jar of Nutella by himself and not accepted complaints from me and my sister since ""they sell more at the supermarket"".

AITA for being mad that my parents aren’t taking me on vacation with them?,"Basically, my parents informed me today that they have 3 vacations planned this year, and all of which are scheduled around my sister’s school schedule( 16 F). The problem is that I’m a full-time college student that’s double majoring and they didn’t ask me about my schedule/when my breaks are, just my sister. So I can’t go on a single one of those vacations or I risk falling extremely behind in my classes. I told them that I couldn’t go and that I would just have to stay home, and they got upset at me and told me I can just skip my classes, that I need to spend time with my family, and that I’ll be fine if I can’t do my school work that week. I got upset and told them that if they want me to go, then they need to take my schedule into consideration and  actually start paying attention to me. They’ve always seemed to ignore me and forget about me, and to be honest it hurts. So little things like this make me way more upset than they should because it’s all built up over time. As an example, they also left me completely alone for Thanksgiving and went on vacation with my grandparents because I had work on Black Friday. I’m ranting now. 

I feel a bit entitled and selfish for being upset about this, and I understand that shit happens. So AITA for being upset?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I didn't apologize to my stepfather?,"I (16m) was supposed to be tutoring my stepbrother (14m) in math. He is really annoying and hard to deal with. He makes weird noises when I am explaining stuff, plays on his iPad and is really rude. He also made my younger brother (11m) cry today. My brother tripped over the books on the floor and my stepbrother called him scizo (my brother has ADHD). I don't think my brother even knew what it meant it just sounded mean to him and he started crying. I told my stepbrother to figure his math homework out himself. 

I was sitting in the kitchen with my brother eating a snack. My stepfather asked me to go with him to the store. He told me in the car that my stepbrother told him that I wasn't helping him with math anymore and I told him about how hard it is to actually get anything done with him. He said that he's only 14 and I need to be more patient. I also told him what he said about my brother and he said ""you're using that as an excuse for the evil in your heart."" I told him I don't care what you think about me because you're not my dad. He turned around, drove home really fast and told me to get out of his car. 

I went back inside and a couple of minutes later my mom came downstairs. I guess he called her. They have been married for almost 1 year. She said that when he got  back I had to apologize. I said if he said sorry and my stepbrother said sorry to Matt then I'll say sorry. She said I was being disrespectful and petty and I went upstairs. I called my dad to come and get me and left without saying anything. She was extra mad about that and I admit I probably should not have done that.

AITA asking for my book back?,"This happened a few years ago but there was a recent post that reminded me of this particular conflict. I was  participating in a school festival and there were many breaks between practice. I always carried a couple of books to read in the breaks. This girl whom I didn't know at all asked me for a book I was reading. For some reason I said yes(at that time i was a people pleaser kind of person, i wouldn't say yes to such a request again). After I finished reading i lent it to her. I am ridiculously attached to all my books and in the following week I was very anxious about her accidentally damaging the book, me not being able to find her after the practice was over( my school at the time was very big and she was at least 4-5 grades above from me, therefore in a different building during normal school hours altogether). I asked her a couple of times and every time she was kinda annoyed, like 'I'll return it to you', 'I'll find your class'(hard to do as there were 20+ sections in my grade alone, and i didn't even know her name). After a while of pestering her to return my book, she got really annoyed and basically pushed the book into my chest with a 'here, why did you let me take it if you were not gonna let me finish it?'

The reason I think I was the a-hole: I did give it to her so I should have waited till she finished it or not given it to her at all and my name was written on the book so she could have been able to find me.

"AITA For still eating normally on occasion, despite my husband being on a restrictive diet?","I’m 34F, and my husband is 41M.

I’ll spare the details but my husband is obese (I am not), I frequently tried to encourage healthy eating but no luck. He is now pre-diabetic, and has a lot of other health issues now and has to go on a super restrictive diet. I joined him on this diet to support him because I care about him. This was 4 months ago.

While I want to support my husband, the food he has to eat is miserable. I miss normal bread and normal food. Whenever I try to introduce normal food back into the house he slips up. Whenever I talk to him about me returning to normal food he gets upset. So lately I’ve been eating out a lot and/or keeping food at work (our jobs weren’t affected by the pandemic and eating out a lot - while still a waste of money - has not caused any financial issues). I’ll go out for lunch, and oftentimes after work I’ll eat a small supper so that I don’t have to eat as much when I come home.

AITA for not paying the full price of the blind boxes after realizing they were opened?,"I think ""blind box"" is the correct term, but I could be wrong as English is not my first language. They are a kind of merchandise like random toys sold in boxes of the same size, weight, label and prices and usually come in themes of collectibles. I am currently collecting a set of cat figurines which consist of 21 ""common"" types, 7 ""gold"" types and 2 ""black"" types, in which the black are the limited edition and can be sold more than 100 times of the original price online.

&#x200B;

My colleague offered to buy for me the blind boxes at a cheaper shipping rate as she is collecting the same set and so I asked her to order 50 blind boxes for me and I would pay her later. When the boxes arrived and when she passed them to me I realized that all the seals in the boxes were opened. There is an unwritten rule that only the buyer should open the blind boxes to be the first one to enjoy surprises.

&#x200B;

I asked my colleague what is the meaning of this and she said that she let her daughter opened them, that she never looked into the contents and that her daughter put them back afterwards. I don't believe this, for all I know she could be running through my boxes in search of the black figurines and would swap mine with hers if she really got it. I unboxed all the loose boxes and then did a calculation based on their value online and gave my friend a figure that is a little lower than half the price of the blind boxes.

&#x200B;

My colleague would not accept it and wanted the full sum, but I told her that I ordered from her 50 sealed blind boxes and she did not deliver, so I would only buy them according to their prices online sold by other buyers. She then threatened to report me to the HR but I doubt they would bother as this has nothing to do with our job. However, other colleagues who heard of this were saying that I should just give her the full price as they were not expensive to begin with and that I was still able to unbox them, but it just doesn't feel the same knowing that they were already opened to begin with.",Not the A-hole
AITAH for not referring to the cats as my fur babies?,"On mobile disclaimer.

Now, before I get eaten alive - this entails just me. If you call them fur babies, all the power to you! I'll call them your fur babies too, I have no issue with it nor would I make fun of anyone for it.

Onto the story.

My husband and I have two 7 year old sister cats, we've had them since they where kittens.

In all the time we've had them, I have never thought of them or refered to them as my/our fur babies. My husband would and I never said anything because it's not something that bothers me.

I suppose he noticed but never mentioned it until it came up last night.

Last night we where having a ""double date"", really just a zoom call with his co-worker and newish girlfriend. 

As we never met her before and she could see a highchair in the background she asked how many babies we have.

I said one, my husband said three. I laughed but he gave me a look and clarified ""our youngest 7 month old baby and two fur baby cats""

I just shrugged it off but big mouth co-worker just had to say he's never heard me refer to the cats as my fur babies.

Well the conversation went from being light hearted and fun to a debate on pets vs fur babies.

New girlfriend came to my defense but only because she doesn't think *anyone* should refer to  pets as fur babies - a sentiment I wholeheartedly do not agree with but she only made me look like a bigger asshole. Didn't help that I doubled down on saying they're not my babies, they're *just* my pets - nothing more. I probably said that a good 10 times during the call.

Group chat ended with the two of them fighting and my husband seeming very sad and aloof for the rest of the night.

For some context these are the first pets I have ever owned. My mom's allergic and my dad was indifferent to the idea of pets in our home. As it turns out, I'm allergic too which probably hasn't helped with the bonding. The only allergy meds that work so far, only work to keep my skin from developing rashes but it still makes breathing at home difficult and it aggravates my asthma.

My husband's side of our family, on the other hand have always had pets, typically cats but one or two dogs as well and no pet allergy.

So, very different views.

My husband has still been a bit aloof today not angry but he seems very hurt. His co-worker told me I'm a jerk and I do feel like an asshole for not having this kind of bond with the cats and for letting my husband down.

AITA For asking a close friend to not do hard drugs?,"Firstly, fake names. I (18) have a friendship with Ellie (20), whom I've known for several years, in which there is a mutual romantic interest. Ellie has some mental issues (think bipolar disorder, along with some other big name ones). She had a really bad childhood. I'm saying this cause I feel it's important information to judge our actions.

&#x200B;

She lives with her recent ex, brother and his girlfriend. I helped her through the breakup, gave advice as best I could, and made sure to respect their relationship even though I had strong feelings for her. We've basically been sort of a thing for months now; I get to see her every so often, and we text a lot. Trust me, it's not just a rebound.

&#x200B;

I don't usually request things of her, one time I asked her to promise me that she wouldn't get back with her ex because she had been talking about ""how easy it would be to get back with him."" I was probably overstepping my bounds then, but that's the only thing I can remember requesting of her.

&#x200B;

Before this recent event, I'd voiced concerns about her alcoholism. At first she didn't take it too seriously, but eventually she realized she was an alcoholic. However, she decided it wasn't a problem. On New Years her oldest sister was visiting them. It had been planned for a while in advance that they would do a hard drug. I made it clear how uncomfortable that made me. Ellie said that it wasn't anything to worry about. Even though it made me really uncomfortable, I figured I could live with it if she only did it \~once a year (which she said).

&#x200B;

Well, yesterday, her sister was visiting and they all did drugs again. Ellie decided to text me that she was gonna be drunk, on drugs and meds. I told her that I was really uncomfortable and apologized (which I do way more than I should) because I'd probably be distant for that night.

&#x200B;

I was talking with one of our mutual friends today, and I basically broke down crying in front of them. They gave me some advice and said that my feelings were definitely valid, and assured me that I should genuinely bring them up to her. They suggested just giving an ultimatum. I followed that advice.

&#x200B;

I texted her saying that I wanted to talk about something. I told her that it makes me incredibly uncomfortable. She replied ""Okay?"", and that ""my comfort isn't her problem."" I said that my feelings were valid. She said something like ""Oh, but only your way is valid. Yeah, got it."" I asked her to not do the hard drug, and she said that I was overstepping, and ""What right do you have to ask that?"" I ended up saying that I'd still be her friend and that I still care about her a lot, but just this something that I can't deal with. She said that she doesn't have to listen to a ""whiny teenager"", and that ""It's nice to see what you really think of me."" To be fair I had also said earlier ""I'm glad I know where your priorities lay."" I kinda feel like I'm in the right but I also feel like shit. So Reddit, AITA?",Asshole

The former head of IT for company B retired just before the merger began and I'll be honest, I cannot stand his replacement.

There's a song written by him that has her name in it. It's like her own personal theme. Every time she makes a friend, it's her go-to ice-breaker. Our daughter is young and we even play it as a little lullaby for her.

They said they'd pay me and my cousins about 30 euros per day, which is a lot for me and where I live. I have never worked for money before so I kind of want to try it out. And I know what I'm doing around olive trees because we used to play and help our grandparents and their olives and vines when I was a kid.

I thought my parents would be accepting, well my dad kind of is but he's taking my mom's side and she thinks I'm too young to seriously work for pay and she's terrified of snakes, although they don't come out at this time of the year.

My mom believes that when we helped out as kids, that wasn't real work, and so I'm not prepared to deal with actual manual labor... or snakes because she's scared of them, even though we've never seen them and they come out in spring and summer anyway.

AITA if I decide to sell cakes too when a family member already sells cakes,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Throwaway, details/business changed etc. I don't give permission for this to be posted elsewhere.

&#x200B;

Since I was young (12-19, early 30's now) I've always loved baking, cakes in particular. I had dreams of being a great cake baker, unfortunately I had a lot of shit go down in my life in my late teens that left me kind of depressed and I put my dreams on hold because I lacked the motivation. Then I met my awesome partner, got together, had our first child. When we were expecting our first child I started looking back into baking cakes and seriously making a business of it. I spent several hours looking up info, researching how to bake certain cakes, trying to see how I could make it all work. I needed the help of my partner, both emotionally and financially (which they were 100% on board with) but my partner tends to never really be as invested into things I want/am interested despite me asking/reminding them. Well, I never received that support from them and my dream didn't happen.

&#x200B;

Fast forward a couple of more kids and years later, my partner's sibling, who has never expressed any kind of interest in making cakes, decides to open up their own cake shop and they're doing well. I won't lie, I'm jealous. I'm upset. Maybe I'm being petty and gatekeeping but they're not a great baker. They use premixed box cake (there is nothing wrong with that, but to me, someone who actually does from scratch recipes and went through the long process of learning how to bake cakes it just makes it seem like they're a hack). I have told my partner in the past that I had been severely disappointed and resented them for never supporting me and well this sibling's success just kind of brought all those negative feelings back and while I am happy for that sibling and I honestly do wish them the best I can't help but feel ""that could have/could be me"".

&#x200B;

Now my partner knows they fucked up and they have apologized. I would still like to do something baking related and we are in a point in our life where we can make that happen. I decided to start out by specializing in cookies instead because to be honest in my area there is a lot of people in the cake making business so I want to do something that's related to baking but not something that everyone does. I finally have my partner's support and it's actually going to happen this year.

&#x200B;

But here is where I wonder if I'm the asshole: my passion is still baking cakes. I love cakes, always have and always will even if I didn't bake as much as I used to when I was younger, but obviously now I'm going to start up again. While I wish the best for the sibling in their cake business, I would eventually love to offer cakes along with cookies like package deals (and brownies, macaroons and other baked stuff in the future).

So it was me, B, D and M, I ended up talking about his streamer friend and he ended up revealing too much as how they were apparently in a ""relationship"" and they were dating, as a full surprise from how B explained it, I asked him a bunch of questions and from his answers it seemed like they never did any type of virtual date and barely did chat apart from in-game chats and even then she'd usually mute him, I ended up joking saying he was a ""f***ing simp dude"" and surprisingly he got heated, ended up yelling a bunch of profanity, blocking him and leaving the chat.

This obviously isn't that serious but I do feel kinda bad since I only know as much as B and D knew and they could be wrong, AITA?",Asshole
AITA for dragging my cousin’s girlfriend into a conflict about my sexuality?,"My family and I have been doing zoom meetings every weekend during covid. I (17f) have been out as queer (not sure if I’m bisexual or a lesbian) to my parents for almost a year now. I have started dating a girl and we’ve been together for like 3-4 months now, and I decided I wanted to finally come out to my family and then introduce my girlfriend to them. I came out to my family members on a zoom last Saturday and told them I wanted to meet my girlfriend this week (so a few days ago). They were all really excited and pretty much expected my coming out because I’ve never really been overly into boys. 

So we get on zoom a few days ago and I’m with my girlfriend in the same room on the meeting. We aren’t being touchy at all, just sitting together in bed and talking to my family. They were all getting along and things were a lot better than I anticipated. The zoom was basically my grandma, aunts, a few cousins and my uncle. There are a few cousins on my dad’s side who are pretty intolerant who don’t usually attend the zoom meetings simply because they’re not really close with us. One of my cousins Rob (who I’m out to) is best friends with one of these cousins Ricky. Rob or someone else probably told Ricky about my sexuality- which is fine, people talk, and I don’t see him too much. 

Ricky and his girlfriend Nicole ended up coming to the zoom because Rob was there and they wanted to talk about beer. Nicole has a four year old girl who was with them. Well I’m not sure that Ricky knew I would be with my girlfriend and he was quiet for a large majority of the time. My mom pressed him about it and he said “frankly I am upset to see (my name) being like that in front of (Nicole’s daughter) and I feel weird showing her this indecency and having it be a role model.” 

Ricky and Nicole are extremely touchy-feely and graphically open about their sex life at parties. I was upset and so I said, “when Nicole was giving you a lap dance at our last in person party and making out with you with her daughter nearby I don’t remember you complaining about indecency.” 

Everyone on the zoom got really quiet, and people were mad at me because I brought Nicole into a situation that seemingly only involved Ricky and I. Nicole said nothing, just looked uncomfortable. My family states that I am in the wrong and that I am being a prude/discouraging sex positivity. I’m wondering peoples insight here, I feel like my gf and I existing is not really bad? Idk

EDIT: we were sitting against the wall, her bed is pushed up against it. I replied to a few comments asking how we were in bed. We weren’t under the covers or anything. We were wearing hoodies and stuff and basically against the wall not even touching.",Not the A-hole
AITA for teaching my daughter that her father's family giving her a nickname is anti-Semitic?,"I'm Jewish, and my 2 kids (5f, 8m) are being raised semi-Jewish. They have different fathers.

My daughter's dad, ""Ex"", hasn't been involved before now, but he's here now and is trying to make up for lost time, which I fully support. However, with Ex comes his family, and I had all sorts of problems with them when we were together. They'd ask really invasive questions and make very offensive comments all the time about my religion.

When I named my daughter, I named her after one of my grandparents, the same as I did for my son. My grandparents had/have very stereotypically Jewish names. Think ""Miriam"" and ""Mendel"", though the real names aren't so archaic, but that level of stereotypical Jewish name. Miriam's real name has a bit of an unusual sound in it, but it's found in most languages outside of English, and the name itself, and this pronunciation, are fairly popular in England, where we are.

Ex and I have been easing into 50/50 custody of Miriam, but we're only up to unsupervised weekends right now. Ex told me that he's introduced her to his parents. Miriam came back from Ex's parent's place a couple weeks ago, and at dinner Mendel asked me what his ""English name"" was. I asked him what that meant. He said that Miriam says that we have our Jew names and our English names. I asked her where she got that from and Miriam said that granny and grandpa call her Maisie because they said that's her English name. She admitted to not liking it, but said it's just what they call her. Ex didn't even try to deny it, immediately defending his parents, saying they can't pronounce the name and they're too close minded to learn it. I said they can learn, but he insisted otherwise. When I pointed out that Miriam doesn't like it, he said she's 5, she doesn't know what she likes.

So I sat both kids down for a talk about anti-Semitism, microaggressions, and the importance of learning people's names, and said, in no uncertain terms, that their names are the names I gave them, they reflect their heritage, and the only person who can change them is themselves. Miriam has continued going round Ex's house, and today she went back to her grandparents for the first time since that talk. She refused to respond to ""Maisie"" and apparently said something like ""mummy says Maisie is rude"".

They did not take it well. Ex brought Miriam back a full day early and after I sent her to bed he asked me to step outside, which I did, and he proceeded to accuse me of trying to turn Miriam against him/his family, said I was trying to make him look like a bad father and his parents like bad grandparents, and that I'd confused Miriam, upset his parents, and shown him up. He says he's trying to connect with Miriam and I've caused issues with that, so he wants me to undo it, so she responds to Maisie again.

I said that they can and will learn her damn name, and I won't help them teach her to hide her Jewishness to make his parents more comfortable. He said I was overreacting and unreasonable as it's just a nickname and accused me of using her as a pawn in my own personal issues with his family. He also said I was driving a wedge between Miriam and her grandparents, and between him and Miriam by extension, and that he was struggling enough being introduced to her life at this stage of her life, I didn't have to make connecting with her harder than it was, and that of all the debates I could choose to stand firm on, this is a relatively minor one compared to all the other negotiations we'll have to come to over the years.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my bf he was enabling his sister and his family has boundary issues?,"My bf (35) was at my house the other night, we were very much so winding down and getting ready to go to bed. His sister (25) sent him a text and was clearly very drunk. So he called her to make sure she was ok. She still lives at home, but was at her bf’s house. As far as I’m concerned, that should be the end of the discussion- she’s an adult in a safe place, right?

Well, apparently not because he offered to go and pick her up so she could stay at his apartment. Because she didn’t want her mon to know she had too much to drink or that she was going to stay at her bf’s house. This turned into a 20+ minute conversation of them and her bf trying to decide what to do, and I walked away because quite frankly I feel like I’m too old for this. I’m 33, I have two kids who at this time are sleeping in their beds, and I don’t understand why a 25 year old woman is calling her older brother to help her hide from her mother. 

The call ended with “call me and let me know what you decide. I will come get you so you can stay at my place.”

I told him that this was ridiculous and she needs to grow up. She either needs to learn how to deal with their mother or she needs to make better choices and not drink so much- and she does drink a lot. It’s not his responsibility to drop everything on a Saturday night to go run to her to help keep secrets from their mom. It wasn’t an emergency, she was at her bf’s house. 

He got annoyed with me and told me that I let that ruin the whole day, and I specifically said it didn’t ruin anything. I was annoyed and wasn’t going to proceed with putting on lingerie and drinking wine or anything only to have her call again and have him go running out the door. Why would I bother doing that? But was everything ruined? No. They just need to set some boundaries and he enables the shit out of that behavior. 

I didn’t say anything to him about it after that initial conversation, but he brought it back up in another unrelated discussion. So I guess it upset him that I said anything at all. 

Was I wrong? Is it acceptable for grown siblings to get drunk and call their older siblings and ask them to leave their partner in the middle of the night to drive them from their partner’s house, where they are safe, just because they don’t want their mom to find out? 


TLDR: my bf(35) got a drunk message from his sister (25). She was in a safe place, with her bf at his house, but was afraid to tell her mom- who she lives with. She wanted my bf to pick her up so she could stay at his place and help lie to their mom about it. Am I the Asshole for telling him he enables her behavior, that she needs grow up, and they all need to set some boundaries?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not washing the dogs?,"So this happened today. My family recently moved and now we're staying with our uncle and his family. They have two dogs, a new puppy and another dog that they've had for a while. I've wanted a dog for a while, and so has my sister. So they've made us help with their puppy and the other dog. It's a little hard, picking up poop and pee all the time, but nothing I can't handle. But today my cousin left her puppy in her crate for too long, and she peed herself and laid in the pee. So they had to give it a bath. Only my sister bathed the dog since our cousin had school and we didn't. She didn't ask for help at all the first time, and I would have went and gladly helped. Then later in the day, they were painting and they left paint on the floor and the dogs got into the paint. At the time I was playing with friends, which doesn't happen a lot. My sister came and asked if I could help, and I said that I was playing with my friends and that couldn't our cousin help her? So then my dad comes home and hears that I didn't help, and that this is strike one. I think that I'm not the asshole, because both of these incidents were caused by them not paying enough attention to the dogs and leaving stuff out. If it was my dog sure, I'd do it, cuz it's my dog. But it's not. I'd wash them any other time but not this one because it was directly caused by them. My dad thinks I'm the asshole because if I had helped it would have put less strain on them, and this is a learning experience.",Asshole
AITA for reporting someone for bullying me at work?,"I was co-chairing a work group with this individual for 7 months. We don't work in the same office or have the same manager.  The first few months were okay, kind of a honeymoon period. About 4 months in, my co-chair starts acting really immature (undermining me in meetings, insulting me, saying provocative things). I ask her to address this behaviour and she gets extremely defensive. I care a lot about the group I'm co-chairing so I decide to proceed with as little contact with this individual as possible - something not possible, in hindsight. I'm also doing the lion's share of organizing throughout our time working together. Her behaviour gets progressively worse and the group suffers as a result of the infighting between me and this other individual. I ask her to discuss the working dynamic again, and she doesn't respond to my messages for a few days. 

The final straw is when she asks me to write an email to someone regarding a work initiative. I send an email with her cc'd and she almost immediately sends a second email repeating the same information I have written. When I ask her why she did this, she tells me my email wasn't ""direct enough"". I tell her we can address the working dynamic or I can step down because I am not going to tolerate her disrespect anymore. I end up stepping down and submitting a complaint to HR along with a bunch of screenshots of our exchanges over the past few months. I request that her manager speak to her about her bullying behaviour or that at least a note be added to her file in case someone has a similar issue with her in the future.

This bully has had a pretty difficult life, lots of unresolved trauma. She's also dyslexic and has expressed difficulty reading social cues. From the outset, she clearly wanted to be friends, but this is a work thing and my priorities were with improving the group we were chairing. We very well could have been friends if we had met outside of work, but I wasn't into the blurring of personal and professional boundaries. She also made very little effort to get to know me and tended to overshare things that were going on in her life.

I know workplace policies regarding disrespectful behavior can be ableist and HR protects corporate interests etc etc but I feel like this kind of behaviour has no place in the workplace.

AITA for showing my wife an embarrassing video of my mom?,"My mom can be kind of bitchy to my wife. I don't tolerate it, and we are working on boundaries, but right now it is a work in progress. I have a beautiful three month old son, who my mom met a month ago. My wife went out for some alone time when my mom came over. My mom offered to change his diaper, and since I am a totally exhausted new parent I let her. I was videoing him, just because everything he does is totally awe inspiring and video worthy right now, and my brilliant son, with great aim, pissed all over her, the face, the hair, it was glorious.

Ok so my mom reacted like a normal person. she has had kids. Shit happens. I told her that I got it on video, and again she wasn't upset or anything, and then she became very angry and demanded that I not show my wife. I told her to lighten up, it will probably happen to both of us some day, and my mom insisted that I do not show my wife. Ok mom whatever.

Well of course I showed my wife. Being a new mom is insanely hard and I knew it would make her laugh. My mom asked me, so I was honest and she will not speak to me. It has been four weeks and she will not respond. I know she is alive because of social media. My wife agrees with me that she is being a drama queen but now I feel kind of bad.",Asshole
AITA for not thanking my mom when she paid for pizza?,"This is really petty, and I'm sure it will blow over soon, but I just want to know if I'm in the wrong.

My  boyfriend and I just moved out together, and my family (mom, sister,  dad) helped us with the move. My family had to leave before dinner, so I  ordered a pizza for just my boyfriend and I. The way the timing worked  out, the pizza showed up just as my parents were leaving.

My  mom offered to pay for the pizza, and I declined, because they weren't  even going to get to eat it. My mom insisted, and paid for the pizza  anyway. I told her she really didn't have to, and then she said, like I  was three, ""Now, what do you say when someone pays for your food?""

I'm  a grown woman, and this was in front of my boyfriend, so I wasn't about  to be humiliated by actually responding ""Thank you."" Basically I just  laughed at her, and told my parents to have a safe drive.

AITA for not letting dude from FB into my apartment,"Ok so some info to keep in mind:
I am a single woman living alone in LA.
Ok so. I listed a gadget of mine on FB marketplace and this dude hits me up a couple of days ago wanting to “take a look” at it. I said yes, gave him my general area (not my specific address) and we planned on meeting at 7:30. He was a no show. Never showed up. 
Two days later (today) he messages me again and says I want to come check it out can I do that today. I’m like... sure. So he’s like GREAT I’ll be there in half an hour. Which irked me because he just assumes I’m free which is rude IMO. 
Tell me my dumb ass isn’t sitting outside for over an hour while he runs late and doesn’t let me know.
Finally I go inside thinking he bailed again and he messages me saying he’s here. So I go back down, mask on, and STILL DONT SEE HIM. I message him and am like.. I don’t see you. He’s like I’m COMING. 5 minutes later he’s waltzing towards me at the end of the block even though I had said to pull into the driveway.
He approaches me with his hands up like in a “I surrender” motion.. weird. My dog is with me and barks at him which should have been a red flag. Basically I hand him the gadget and he gives me the rudest look and says “well.. I have to plug it in to test it.”
I’m like oh.. well shit.
Like I completely honestly didn’t think about that.
He’s like yeah can I come inside?
I said I wasn’t comfortable with that. This is a dude from the internet and already was giving me weird vibes, I live ALONE and I’ve learned to trust my gut. 
And I said yeah, I just don’t feel comfortable with that. I’m sorry I should have sent a video of it working, and I understand if you don’t want to buy it without testing it. I can assure you it works though!
He’s like YOU CANT SELL STUFF WITHOUT PEOPLE TRYING IT FIRST
and was so condescending and rude. So I was like
Over it at this point so I was like alright dude. And he was like let me know if you change your mind.

AITA for refusing to dress femininely for my mom and making her upset?,"I (16) am an AFAB non-binary person in the closet. I dress mainly in t-shirts and sweatpants, the same few outfits over and over again. It’s difficult for me to wear certain clothes for extended periods of time due to sensory issues, and feminine formal clothing tends to be more difficult for me on average than male formal clothing, so I often end up wearing a collared shirt, tie, and formal slacks to big events. My mom wants me to dress more femininely at least for church holidays and formal events, and has requested that I wear a jumpsuit that looks a bit like a dress instead. Though it made me a bit dysphoric, I suffered through this for my mom’s sake seeing as none of my siblings dressed femininely often and she was upset about this. One time I was going to a school dance, which I only attended for a friend’s sake, and allowed her to put makeup on me (the worst sensation for me when it comes to dressing femininely) so she would be able to do the girly things she likes with someone. She was extremely happy and obliged, but started saying things like “It’s okay to look like a girl every once in a while.” This made me extremely dysphoric, and just felt insulting in general. As she was taking me to the dance, she stopped just to show me to my grandma and said “You look so nice with those raccoon eyes covered up.” This really hurt my feelings, and then I got teary. She told me that she was allowed to say that because she has circles under her eyes, too, and that I need to stop being so sensitive. Following this, I’ve refused to let her put any makeup on me, and resisted any compromise on dressing “like a girl” for her. My dysphoria is getting worse, and I’m not going to make myself go through that and my sensory issues for someone who insults aspects of my appearance. She has since gotten sad and a bit annoyed at times because she feels none of “her girls” want to dress girly, while she is the one who has to pay for our clothes.

AITA for not explaining movies anymore?,"Title is a bit weird so hear me out..

I (M28) live with my girlfriend 27. We've been together for about 4 years and living together for 2.

A huge part of our relationship is watching films or series together and I truly enjoy it. We can watch a different film about 5-6 evenings a week and/or  watch a series together. She has series other she watches alone and so do I.

Onto the problem. 

EVERY. SINGLE.  FILM. OR EVERY. SINGLE. EPISODE she will ask me what is going on. Like literally every single one. Initially I was okay with it because well, dno, I want her to understand what is going on? 

But after about 4 years its rather, exhausting. 

I usually try to answer her but sometimes its annoying to have to break focus from the film/show to explain THE SAME SCENE WE JUST WATCHED FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE SAME TIME. I'm not the fucking director, I didn't make the film, I don't know what the actor meant by that. Just keep watching and we will find out.

But noooooo, ""What does he mean?"" ""Who is this guy?"" ""How come she came out of there?"" ""What is this scene showing?""

Bro it's literally on the screen now just fucking look and stop asking me. Sigh. 

Im never rude about it out loud or anything but now I'm getting to the point where I dislike watching stuff with her because I know it's going to be 1000 questions when all I'm tryna do is sit in silence and watch the damn show/movie.

So last night we were watching Designated Survivor and the same thing happened. I said calmly (because I knew it would be drama if I said it in a serious voice) ""Babe ngl it's annoying when you keep asking questions about stuff. Sometimes I don't understand it either but you just have to wait and see. Or sometimes just use common sense and see what is going on then from there you can sort of understand what is being spoken about or what is going on during the scene. Or just try to figure it out for yourself because it gets annoying constantly having to explain things we are both watching for the first time. I don't know what is going on either.""

I could tell she was offended and she asked me who else she is supposed to ask if it's only us watching it. Then she went and said ""sorry for being so slow but I'll never ask you again mr smart"" (something like that. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel less than but I just want to sit through a film in peace without 50 cent over here asking me 21 questions. 

So AITA?

Edit: Just to clarify, I didn't jump from always explaining to suddenly finding it annoying after 4 years. I've used comments like ""I don't know,  we're watching the same thing I'm not sure what's gonna happen"" or ""just wait and see maybe they'll reveal it further on"" 

The same happens if I'm listening to Creepypasta. 


Initially it was cool because I guess I didn't notice it as much and I'm happy to explain things. What I'm not happy about is the amount of times I need to explain things when I don't know the plot myself. Just be patient and wait.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I returned the gifts I bought for my brother and his family.,"
My (28F) brother, call him B, (25M) and SIL (23F) have been together for 9 years.

SIL and I have never had a good relationship. I think she’s too uptight and she thinks I’m too eccentric. I have tried to have a relationship with her but it never worked out. B and I have managed to remain close

SIL consistently throws temper tantrums over really minute things. Like the day I wanted to get married.  She also talks down to B and insults his intelligence a lot. 

So they had twins in October, 2 boys. They were 6 weeks premature and spent the first 3 weeks in the NICU

Throughout the pregnancy I tried very hard to be involved. I bought them a ton of baby stuff, offered to buy the gender reveal cakes drove out (an hour and a half) regularly to bring them things

So, SIL told me I could buy the gender cakes. A few weeks before the reveal I reached out to ask how to get the gender info for the cakes and she didn’t answer the question at all and just ignored it. Finally 3 days before the reveal she was like “we decided not to do cake my mom is going to take care of it.” I understand that this isn’t really that big of deal, but it really upset me that she just went ahead and made other plans without telling me at all, and blatantly ignored me when I reached out

There were several other incidents throughout the pregnancy. But the straw that broke the camels back was when she refused to let me meet my nephews.

Since the babies were born I have talked to B a total of 3 times. Once the day after they were born, on thanksgiving when I tried to schedule time to go meet them, and then a week before Christmas. That time I was able to make plans to go meet my nephews. I

 have tried and tried to reach out to both of them and they just don’t respond at all. I’m not the only one they are doing this to, my mom said she’d have an easier time getting ahold of the president


I got sick the day before I was supposed to go and couldn’t

I still have not talked to them, but have communicated through my mom who is there visiting. I have been trying to reschedule, but SIL said that I couldn’t come because I had been sick.

Now mind you I was sick for 10 days over Christmas and New Years. It’s not like I tried to go immediately after I recovered

SIL demanded proof that I’m no longer ill which is impossible to get

I feel like she is deliberately keeping me away, and B won’t stand up to her. My mom thinks I’m overreacting and being immature. I feel like 9 years of standing by and playing nice is just too much

At this point everyone in her family has met my nephews, and everyone on my side except for me has met them

It breaks my heart but I feel like even if I continue this battle I’ll still never get to see my nephews. It seems like at this point maybe I should just cut my losses, return the gifts, and try to move on

It would be different if this was an isolated incident.

Edit: when I got sick it was in fact a certain world wide illness. SIL wants a negative test which can’t be done because the test continues to detect dead virus for up to 3 months after. I was not upset she asked for a negative test. I was upset she didn’t believe me when I tried to explain that it can’t be done. 

Her past behaviors make me fear that the longer I wait the easier it will be for her to keep me away. B doesn’t seem to care to share his opinion. If he asked me to back down I would. But as of right now he hasn’t. He has done this in the past where he just kind of lets me and her fight and refuses to pick a side or share an opinion.

2nd Edit: thank you to all who have responded, it’s really helped me figure out where exactly my frustration lies. 

I am upset not so much that they won’t let me come but that they won’t tell me that directly. All communication has been done through my mom who flew in from the west coast to visit them. I still think she’s trying to keep me away. Because she has always pushed me away and then it got worse when she got pregnant.

Final edit: okay I’ve gotten a lot of fed back that I need to treat this as in isolated incident because protective instinct etc. and that ITA in the event of isolated incident and I can accept that. 

I have not yet decided if I’m going to continue trying to have a relationship with them when there has been so many incidents where she pushed me away outside of that. I’m still tired of fighting. Even if I let this one go there will be more.",Asshole
AITA For telling my half brother he isn’t owed anything?,"I 26(m) live in a home with my disabled 35(f) sister that we both inherited from our dad when he passed away. He passed about six weeks ago, and I moved in shortly after to look after my sister as our mom passed away a few years ago. 

Our dad wasn’t a good guy, but he wasn’t a bad guy either, and I guess the same could be said about my mom. When I was younger my mom and dad split up for a few years. My dad got another woman pregnant and my mom got pregnant with my sister so technically I have a 1/2 brother who does not live here nor do I know and my sister is my 1/sister. 

I know a little bit about my younger “brother.” He was raised with another 1/2 brother by his grandmother as his mom got around just like my dad. He apparently had a ok life. I admit it’s weird. My dad or I never spoke to him. He lived in the other side of town his whole life but we never knew him. He lived in a trailer park in the south where problems did happen but I’ve never heard of anything to major. He and his brother are close for what that matters.

My parents got back together and my dad raised my sister as his own. He bought this home before they got back together and it needed, and still needs work however my uncle was able to improve a lot. It’s a good home and has a lot of things that help my sisters life be easier.

Last week I received notice that the estate is being challenged by my half brother. He is claiming a portion of the home and inheritance as there was not will and he has a legal right. When my dad died he didn’t leave a real will behind and neither did my mom. The best we have is a old video that says my dad leaves everything to his kids which he wasn’t raised by my dad or mom.

I had to pay for a consultation with a lawyer and he gave me some grim news a few days later. I guess my dad did a DNA years ago that concluded he was his bio dad and he never paid child support for him, and due to there being no will he is entitled to his “fair” share, and the video helps his case. 

The thing is, my sister doesn’t know my dad isn’t her real dad. This is going to crush her, and I can’t afford to buy our “brother” out of his share of the home. My sister needs were built around this home! I reached out I explain this to him but he said it wasn’t his problem.. it’s like he didn’t care at all. 

I’ve reached out his family to try to explain and they’ve been surprise to hear this too. They’ve told me they are disappointed in him, but his brother reached out and said I was an AH for trying to deny his brother something that is rightly fully his and trying to get trash to fight tour side says the same. 

Am I losing my mind here? He’s trying to take something he’s never even step foot inside! He’s acting like my sister and I owe him because our dad never did anything for him! That’s between them, right!??",Asshole
AITA for taking a stand against my husband's temper?,"Throwaway account because I need judgment on this situation alone. My husband (34m) and I (33F) got into a fight and after I've thought about it I still think I am right. My husband is a kitchen dweller, he loves to bake and cook and do all sorts of things there and I'm not afraid to admit his cooking skills make mine pale in comparison. But, my husband sees his kitchen time as sacred, and since he suffers from PTSD from being in the Army and getting into a lot of fights he says he needs lots of time to ensure his mood is stable. He wears hearing aids because he lost most of his hearing while serving and getting his attention can be hard.

Our fight came from our daughter (8F) coming in while he was baking banana bread and getting his attention by yelling as loud as she could to get over the sound of the mixer as well as his hearing loss. She simply was trying to get his attention, but he exploded at her. He whirled around, bellowed at her to get out of the kitchen and just started flitting around the room in a huff.

I went to him and told him he was too harsh and he needed to understand that she was only 8 years old and yelling at her is harmful. He just stared at me for a few seconds and then without a word went back to what he was doing. I didn't like this and told him that he needs to apologize to her, and he just quietly told me that she scared him and he is still trying to get his heart rate down.

I admit I do not know everything about the sort of things he goes through, but he takes medication for it and I feel even if he was frightened screaming and being so aggressive is not okay. I told him that he could apologize when he was calmer and he has not spoken to me since. I cannot even get him to look at me and he is just meandering around.

I think it is important that he remains collected when our children are impressionable at their young ages. Am I the idiot here?


Edit: Update
Thank you all who looked at this in a nonantagonistic way, especially those who suggested aid. I was able to use this situation to suggest new methods of help and routines since those that have been in place seem to be losing their effectiveness, or maybe just new ones needed because the time came for them.

My husband apologized, and stated his difficulty in processing after being shocked or frightened. He made sure our daughter knew he never wanted her hurt and she apologized to him for scaring him.  I think it would be very good that our whole family start helping in his therapy instead of just him doing it by himself to set up more stable means of aiding his jumpiness.

My daughter also asked if she could help him bake and cook, and I guess he has a sous chef now.  And those who are worried, I am very thankful for your concerns. Our daughter is not scared of her dad at all, and we are not training her to treat her father with silk glove tactics. That may be why she spooked him, but it also lets us address his anger spikes so overall I am VERY thankful for the courage to address this and move past it.

I informed him I made an AITA post and he just groaned and tossed an oven mitt at me because ""now I'm an asshole for all the world."" Keep him on the straight and narrow, reddit!",Not the A-hole
"AITA for telling my dad, his stepdaughter isn't my responsibility?","I (21M) recently moved out of my dads (56M) house. A little backstory, My dad got married to a woman (35F) who has a six year old daughter. I don't like kids for the most part. And things have been hectic ever since I moved out. About a week ago, my dad and his new wife wanted to go on a date night and asked me to watch the stepdaughter. I declined, as I had plans of my own, as well as various tasks around the house and at work to get done. Needless to say, that night I had a full plate. However, this escalated into an argument between me and my dad and ""stepmom"". I explained to my dad, that since you decided to marry a woman with kids thats your responsibility to them not mine, since I didn't marry her. Let I mind you all, that I don't have anything against the daughter as I've watched her on a couple occasions. But at the end of the day, I don't think its my job to play babysitter since I don't even live with my dad anymore.

So, AITA?

WIBTA for choosing a job over my family?,"Adding this back in as I’ve received a few requests: please do not use this post to create content on other platforms (YouTube, tik tok, etc)

&#x200B;

*Tl;dr: My parents are threatening to disown me because of a job. I've been taking advantage of their generosity to save money to get out. WIBTA if I used that money to take the job and leave?*

&#x200B;

I (19F) have been offered a job across the country. The job involves me being in the wilderness for 3 months with limited wifi and no service. The pay is phenomenal and it's in a part of the country I've wanted to visit for years.

However, I live at home and my parents have implied that they'd disown me if I took the job as they don't want me going across the country without them.

I'm fairly capable of heading out there and setting myself up when I get back. I'll be driving out with others from the company, including my partner. When I get back, I'll move onto campus or move in with my partner.

&#x200B;

**Why I think I'm justified:**

I initially planned to move out 2 years ago. I got an acceptance to my dream school across the country. However, my parents talked me into staying home by telling me I was going to give my mom a heart attack and her death would be my fault. I also have a younger brother and I didn't want to leave him alone with them. Had I left, this wouldn't be an argument.

My parents also believe in arranged marriage and want me married in the next year. They don't believe women should live on their own so they want me to live with a husband. They know I don't want that, though they try to push me into it. Now that my brother is almost 18, I'm ready to get out when feasible.

I'm not just cutting them off because of this job, though it is the tipping point. While I've always been able to depend on them for material needs, they can be manipulative. I've dealt with various mental health issues because of them, which only get better as I spend less time at home.

&#x200B;

**Why I think I'm the asshole:**

Most of the money I have saved to be able to leave came from my parents as part of a college fund. I worked through school so that money is sitting in my savings. My parents also allowed me to live with them rent-free, allowing me to save it. There's no way for me to repay it as their income is too high for me to qualify for loans.

My parents also helped me get my car (i.e. drove me to another city to buy it - I paid for it). I feel bad for taking it and leaving.

Additionally, my parents are relying on me for their retirement. I'm a US citizen and they want me to sponsor them into the country, so I'd be screwing their plans.

Finally, if it weren't for this job, I would have lived at home for another year to finish college (my school and is near their house and I don't want them finding me). I feel bad about using them until I can find the chance to leave.

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I chose to take this job, effectively cutting off my family after having used them to get to where I am?

&#x200B;

Edit: I haven’t been able to respond all the replies but I've read every single one of them and I really appreciate all the support. I’ll be taking the job with my head held high and I’ll figure the rest out when the time comes.

AITA for asking my friend to take a video of me dressing down ?,"

So me (F15) and my friend also (F15) go to a very strict school where you can never use your phone and it’s a well known fact that some students use their phones in our changing rooms. Me and another friend were a bit late after gym so we still were rushing to get our clothes on. I already had my pants on but was still open at the front and I was tucking my turtle neck sweater in my pants ( what looked extremely strange tbh with one hand in my pants ) and they were filming a tiktok before us . You can clearly see it’s me on the background but they kept telling me while dancing “ oh relax you aren’t even on screen “ - I only found out after a lot of my friends or contacts saw it on her insta story and asked if it was me and if I was okay with it ( mind you my pants was still unbuttoned and I had my hands in my pants ) I was kinda shocked but stayed calm and as nice as possible - I asked her to please remove it - she was kind and said yes - this was the first time she did it- now flash forward to yesterday - one of the girls in the video had her birthday and due to COVID all her friends posted pictures of them together what was super sweet ( I wasn’t so close with her but still wished her a happy birthday ) - then one of my friends texted me the video was on her story again - I was surprised and told her that I wasn’t comfortable with me still dressing and if she didn’t have another video she could use ( I wanted to include screens but it’s in Dutch as we are from Belgium) and she flipped out on me saying that a was a sensitive little bitch and that I ruined their fun - she went on a rant for 10 minutes and blocked me - I only responded with a meme after the rant

AITA for telling my step-mother-in-law she is not my kid’s grandma?,"More are my SO and I the assholes. (Mainly asking for his sake)

Background: SO and I are (28M and 26F). My SO has a complicated history with his family. His mother died when he was very young and he was raised by her parents due to a fierce custody battle with his father. He saw his dad but only every few weekends and he was raised by his grandparents. His dad remarried when he was about 10 and he has 2 half brothers. It’s important to note this woman who ill call Sheila did NOT raise him, she was and always has been his step-mom. My dad died when I was a kid too and I am completely NC with my whole family (I’ve always been with my maternal and paternal like but cut out my mom and brother later in life when I was 22) 

Sheila has always tried to mother my SO. She has always offered unsavoury comments towards his maternal grandparents and in all the time we’ve been together, it was clear she just wanted the only family for him to be concerned with is his dads side as they share a surname. He has always made it clear to Sheila she is not his mother and she has overstepped by calling him her son to other people and he’s always quick to say she isn’t. He always makes the point that even though his mother died young when he himself was young, he remembers her, he still had a mother and that Sheila has never raised him. He also worked with his dad for a while and it for even worse as he constantly brought our family issues into work. It resulted in him detaching himself from that side as they constantly expected him to care and he there for them yet they couldn’t offer the same. 

SO and I moved from our home city after I got a degree and settled. The only people who were happy for us were his grandparents and the other side told us we’d be back soon. That was 5 years ago. He’s had little contact as they Hardly message but they still talk.

We had our first kid a few weeks ago and introduced her on Zoom. Everyone fussed over the baby and Sheila turned round and said I can’t believe I’m a grandma! I kind of stayed silent but SO was quick to say “actually Sheila, no you’re not a grandma. You’ve constantly stepped over the line telling people you’re my mother and you’re not.” We left the call quickly after.

So and I have both received messages from his father demanding we apologise as Sheila is every much a grandparent as he is, regardless of blood. SO responded that being family by blood or in marriage doesn’t mean much to him since he grew up with very little familial love from his side. I obviously support my SO and I’m now getting flack for it. 

Are we the AHs?

Edit: I feel I should add. When everything kicked off with me going NC with my remaining family, Sheila was very curious about why I didn’t spend that Christmas with my mom and why I cut her off. My SO had to defend me (I wasn’t there) as it wasn’t any of her business and that was the first time she’d asked about me in months and it was just to find out information",Not the A-hole
AITA for demanding my wife to do housework?,"I apologize for any mistake with my English. 

Some information about our situation:

I am a head restaurant manager at big restaurant in my city, it is a very big restaurant.  I work from 8am - 8pm, and another manager from 8pm - 8am (the restaurant is 24 hours). It is very busy because the restaurant is biggest in the city. I have to do some worker jobs and be a manager because not enough workers. 

My wife is a housewife. No jobs. 

We have a child, only one. He is 7 years old now. When he was born, me and my wife made a deal. I would do cooking (breakfast and dinner). She say because she is busy and tired from caring for baby. I cannot argue because I am not a woman, so I agreed. I am very tired but I still follow the deal. 

Now my child is in elementary school. This means my wife has nothing to do during the day, and she does not have to care for him too much because he is older. At the same time, my work has been easier because the restaurant owner hired more workers and another manager to help me. 

Because my wife does nothing except clean the house, I said to her you should do the cooking now. We live in small apartment so clean house is very easy. I have done before, it take one hour maximum. She said it is ""misogynast?"" (she said it mean discrimination) to expect she do the cooking. I said that's okay, you should get a part time job and I do the cooking, because we are saving for a bigger house. She said no. 

Because I work and do the cooking, I think I do a lot of the work and she does very little (only pick up my son and clean house once a day).

AITA for putting a lock on my room door after mother threw away new clothes?,"I, 35f live with my parents. No kids, full time job and pay $650.00 rent a month.  My parents are legally separated but have stayed living together for the past 10 years.  Basically, we all live in a roommate situation.  Everyone buys and cooks their own food, everyone tidies up the communal spaces and for the most part we just all do our own thing.

5 years ago I had my own apartment but lost my job, car and good credit.  Mom invited me to move back in so I could rebuild and I've been doing well in fixing credit and saving money. Mom guilts me to stay now because she relies on my rent $.

My mom has always been nosy and overbearing. As children, she never gave me or my brother privacy. Now that I'm home again, she's got a habit of doing a quick knock on my door and then opening it before I can say ""come in"". She's obtrusive when I'm on the phone and gets angry when I ask her to leave my doorway.  I've nicely requested that she stay out of the room when I'm not home but I know she goes through my stuff.  She calls my room dirty but it's not; some clothes on a chair and an unmade bed is not the end of the world.

Things blew up when I received a package of lingerie.  I immediately tried everything on and of course my mom picked that moment to leave her room to come knocking at my door.  I yelled for her not to come in.  She got huffy and went back into her room slamming her door.  I got irritated and took all the new pieces and shoved them back in the shipping bag along with all the tissue paper and clear plastic. I left the package on the chair that I throw my dirty clothes on. I leave for work the next day and come back home to no clothes or package on the chair.  I ask my mom if she'd seen it and she says ""yes, I threw your trash away and washed your clothes"".  I kind of lost it.  I told her that she'd thrown out $80.00 of brand new underwear and she had no right to be in my room in the first place.  She yelled back that it was her house and if I didn't keep my room a pigsty, she wouldn't have a reason to go in there.

Today, I went and bought a new locking doorknob and installed it while my mom was out of the house then I left for the day.  About 2 hours after I left, my mom started blowing up my phone with angry texts demanding I change the doorknob back and that I didn't have her permission.  When I got home, I completely ignored her and locked myself in my room as she banged on the door and screamed for 5 minutes straight.  I'm now looking for apartments.  I was saving for a house down payment but I can't take this drama.  Brother says I should have left years ago and that our mom is too manipulative.  My friend says that I should not have put a lock on the door without permission and should have just moved out as soon as possible. 4 days in and Mom has yet to apologize for tossing my lingerie, just gave me the silent treatment until today when she blew up about the lock. AITA for installing the lock?

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who offered home resource links, awards, words of encouragement and optimism for my future as a woman living independently again.  I truly appreciate it.  Now, I have a plan for how things will go until I get a place.

\-I will deduct $80.00 from next month's rent

\-I will keep the lock on the door and let my mom know that it will be changed back when I leave

\-I have put the brakes on house hunting for now.  I want to save more.  For now,  I will look for an apartment share situation so I can pay a rent close to what I do now.

\-My brother is nice and would take me in if I was truly homeless. He has his own family and lives about an hour away so that won't work for me.

\-My mom is not dangerous although she might be a narcissist and a horrible snoop that took it too far this time.  When she's not being ridiculous, she's actually fine to be around.  However, I will keep our relationship as LC as possible for the time being. 

\-I have asked my friends to put out feelers for apartment/roommate situations in my price range.  I am also scheduled for a couple of virtual apt tours as well as 1 in person, so YES I am very serious about leaving asap.

\-I told my dad about it and shocker, my mom got to him first and played the victim.  He took my side and told her she should have minded her business and stayed out of my room.  He offered me money to put towards a new place security deposit but I declined.

AITA for telling my sick mother it's her own fault our relationship is so bad?,"Apologies in advance, I'm gonna have to be a bit vague/delicate with some background details in the interest of sticking to the rules and not upsetting/triggering anyone, so you'll have to fill in some stuff for yourselves. 

So as a teenager, I went through something very traumatic over the course of several years. I tried on several occasions to tell my mother what was happening, but she just flat out did not believe me bc the perpetrator was someone she trusted/liked/allowed in our home. Even after that person was no longer part of our lives, she didn't believe me and didn't let me/help me get therapy or anything because she was convinced I was just a bad kid lying for attention. The thing that really finished our relationship off, though, when I was 18 and started dating an older guy who not only helped me get therapy, but paid me for me to go private. My mum took offence to it, accused me of ""slagging her off"" and slandering she and the aforementioned person and refused to believe it was for the best for me. 

So fast forward to now, it's 6 years later, I'm not with that boyfriend any more (shocker, dude in his 30s who dates 18 year old boys was toxic!), but I'm still in therapy and I'm still processing what I went through. My mum is sick with cancer. She's trying to make amends with people whilr she still can, and she reached out to me. We're on speaking terms again, but it's not a good relationship. We're low contact, and we tend to talk only about superficial things. Until the other day, when she brought up my ex and how it was a shame I ended up in a bad relationship so young. One of her examples of something bad he did was ""manipulating me into thinking she'd been a bad mother and talking shit about her to a therapist."" I was baffled by that, and pointed out that it was *her* fault our relationship fell apart. I said for all his faults, my ex was the first person to actually believe me about what happened and support me in getting help for it. I told her she couldn't push her own shortcomings onto someone else, no matter how shitty the other person was and that I can't believe after all this time she *still* can't take accountability for her flawed parenting. I wasn't aggressive in saying this, just very blunt and frank, but I guess it upset her because she immediately hung up the phone and I later got a slew of messages from my sister telling me I'm an arsehole, that she can't believe I'd talk to a dying woman ""that way"" or that I'd imply she was a worse person than my shitty ex and that I owe it to my mother to patch things up while we still have time. 

Idk. I didn't feel badly about what I said at first but after what my sister said...I kind of do. Maybe she's right, maybe I should just let bygones be bygones and get over it to let my mother find peace in what could be her last months.

AITA Roommate Problems," Lets get a few things out of the way. I am a transwoman who is trying to become a metal vocalist. I clearly put up on the kijiji ad that I practice harsh vocals as well as instruments. I got one dude in that the landlord approved, and then she supplied another guy after denying 3 women because she didn't want to mix men and women. This isn't about the landlord though(she let me keep a keylab, a MIDI controller and an audio interface I found in this room when moving in). The first roommate is a chill guy. The second roommate(the one she supplied) however...

This roommate and I had lived in the same house before for a month. We got along during that time. A construction crew was brought in to set that house again because it seemed like it was splitting in two. They found black mold in there. Back then I had a room nestled in a corner that was very soundproofed just by location and design. He had a love for metal music, and rubix cubes. He also seemed to have no problem with me practicing back then. Right before I vacated the house and moved here, he smashed a rubix cube on the ground. I felt concerned for him, so when the landlord brought him here, I both felt sorry for him and thought we would get along, since we had immediately kicked off at the previous house. I also thought it would be cool because he said he plays guitar.

Before he moved in the house was rather peaceful. I would sometimes practice my music/vocals, and me and the other roommate would have sit down meals together. We weren't the tidiest people, but we weren't pigs either.

Anyway, this guy moves in and makes everything spotless, rearranges the furniture several times, and starts trying to control how our routines function. Not too big a deal yet, we simply worked around him.   Back then things were somewhat normal, he would sit down and talk with us for instance, and I thought he was going to have a job in one or two months. One time he spoke about when his own mother put him in a psych ward.

Flash forward six months. He is jobless still, spends 90% of his time in the house, yells at his girlfriend for an hour at a time nearly on a daily occurence, randomly screams at odd hours of the night, and even screams at us/hides when one of us enters a room he is in. I haven't had a normal conversation with him in 2 months. He also has only gotten more controlling over the months. Last but most important, two days ago I was practicing, and after all of that he told me to shut the f up. Now, my potentially ahole part.

I can't afford to soundproof this room, at least at the moment. I'm kind of broke, but that is sort of my fault too. After months of dealing with his bs, when he told me to shut the f up, I snapped on him. I screamed at him, called him an ahole, told him to f off several times whilst he was acting like a self righteous ahole. He eventually came to my room and screamed at me to come out and face him like a man. I didn't.

AITA for not talking to my boyfriend while doing homework,"My boyfriend is the type to think out loud and try to hold a conversation while doing work.  I on the other hand find it very difficult to stay in a concentrated line of thought.  So once I'm in a mindset where I can concentrate, I like do do what I'm doing with no interruptions.  If I try to stop and talk to someone I will completely get derailed.  

My boyfriend gets sad and says I'm being mean when I'm trying to do work because of this.  If I ask him to leave the room while I do some work, or if I leave, or if I don't talk to him he will say I'm being cold or mean.

I'm a freelance artist and yet I don't know much about using Photoshop (or any other program) for actual, professional looking graphic design, so last week I asked my boyfriend if he could design me a pricelist for my commissions, he said he would gladly make one for me over this last weekend (note that we're long distance, he lives a 3 hour drive from here).

Sunday evening comes and I ask him about the pricelist, he only just told me he didn't have adobe illustrator on his laptop at home, just at his work's PC so as soon as he is able to install it on his laptop he gets to work on the pricelist I asked him for.

He sends me a few screenshots of what he's done so far and it looks nothing on the level of what he does for his work, he of couse asked me if I wanted any changes so I ask him for a few tweaks here and there but I still don't like how it looks, I may not know about graphic design but it looks ROUGH and honestly worse than any pricelist I've designed on my own before.

WIBTA if I insist on naming my son after myself?,"I (30m) am not sure how to explain the argument so I will just start from the beginning. I also don't know how specific I am allowed to be, but also don't care if people find this post.

I was born in Okinawa and lived there until I was 5. My whole family loves Okinawa. My parents had lived there for several years before I was born, my grandparents aunts and uncles love the islands, we have had multiple family reunions there. The islands are apart of the soul of my family. Even though I am as white as I could be my parents chose to name me after the islands. After the old Okinawan name for the islands (and also a character from Street Fighter).

Anyway I love my name because of how much it means to the history of my family, and I love Okinawa. But it is causing issues in my relationship.

The argument with my partner (30m) has been ongoing. We have been considering having a kid. We have talked about adoption as well as surrogacy. We are really starting to get serious about it. I have made it pretty clear that if we get a surrogacy and if it ends up being a boy, I would like to name him after myself. My partner is saying that I wbta because I am not Japanese and it is harmful in terms of cultural appropriation. I get his point, I do get odd looks from people when I introduce myself etc. But I still love my name and want to name a future kid after myself. Not to be a weeb but because I really love my name.

So onto the story we were working on the site scheduled 6am to 3pm I came in late that day because my car broke down and needed up coming in at 8am.  Our foreman had an appointment to go to at 2pm so he asked us both if we wanted to stay or go up to us. 

I chose to stay a couple hours to make up time and Abi said she wanted to as well. So cut to an hour later and Abi approached me and asks if I can hurry and finish and I said no because I still had an hour of work left and needed to make up time, but please feel free to go because I could still be a while I am fairly new at this. 

She got angry and I thought she left but another hour later she comes up to me and asks again and I said almost I have another 20 mins to do. 

So after I finally finish she leaves the building with me and says finally lol we can clock out and I’m like haha yea.  Just before heading to my car the general contractor for the site told me that the past 2.5 hours she did nothing except hang out with electrical and talk on her phone. 

So I made a plan to tell my foreman and project manager about what had happened and I did when I got home I just sent a text saying hey Abi and I stayed but she didn’t do any work the GC said she was on her phone and didn’t finish the rooms she was supposed to. 

Anyways she got a strike and the pay deducted. From her account and maybe even more because it’s a common occurrence anyways she figured I said it and was rude until she left. 

I told my mom this recently and she said I should have minded my business but I’m not entirely sure so AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for spending my money how I want to?,"I've posted in this subreddit here before, so some might know who i am and all that.   


This event in question happened about 1 and a half hours ago, and I'm wondering if what i'm doing is making me an asshole.  


So the story goes that I (19M) have started spending my money on what I want, for example my own fast food if my bros and I want any, art commissions, and recently Discord Nitro. That specifically is important. I'd say this has been happening for a few months, an automatic renewal out of my account to keep using Nitro.  I also got antivirus software.  


Just today my mom (50 F) came into my room and told me to stop what I was doing for a bit so she can talk to me. I say no problem, what's up? She then goes into details about how she has access to see what i'm spending my money on, so she knows i'm boosting servers and paying for nitro. She also found out I pay others for commissions. She also went on the whole spiel of how there are scammers out there and how if I don't cancel literally everything on discord, she'll take stuff away from me.  To be fair, I've also been boosting my friends' servers, which is also an automatic renewal. I also canceled my antivirus software renewal and got a free version of it. But to threaten to take my stuff?  


I was also told that not everyone needs my money, which to be fair, is true, but honestly? I'm only doing it to be nice to my friends.  She was the one to set up my account a few years ago, and won't separate anything anytime soon. Just an FYI. I would be understanding of all of this, except she was rude the whole entire time. Trying to get me off my laptop so she could cancel everything herself, even. And I was looking at her in the eyes, listening to her talk to me, and she made remarks to 'not give her that look'. And to top it off, that whole chat was unprovoked, just out of nowhere. She also threatened to get into my business, which is honestly scary. She has tried that before.  


I don't even know anymore. I think that even if it looks like i have these renewals going on, it's still my money at the end of the day. I'm starting to believe I'm actually the asshole and a wreckless spender, too. Is she right? AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for getting annoyed when my boyfriend talks about adoption?,"TLDR: He wants one asian and one white kid. I am uncomfortable with the idea of picking/excluding children based on preference.

My boyfriend (white) and I (hispanic/asian) have recently been talking about adoption (we are both gay men so this is our chosen option for having children). Although this should be a happy situation, I can’t help but cringe whenever we talk about the details. You see, he has been thinking about it since he was a child and has very specific ideas of what he wants. He wants one Asian girl and a White boy, and has names for them already. Whenever we talk about it, I get annoyed and it often turns into a fight. Personally, it makes me uncomfortable to hear that he has a preference in the race of our child. Additionally, I don’t feel like I have any choice in terms of the name, as anything else would go against his dream. 
I need to know if my feelings are valid or if I’m being crazy. Is it normal for people to want a specific race in adoption? Am I being weird for having a problem with it?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my moms friend to stfu bc of an icky joke?,"Okay English isnt my first language so don't expect much, sorry

Yesterday one of my moms friends (lets call her Anna) came over for coffee, chatting whatsoever. 
Anna is alright, she and my mom are good friends and her kids are friends with my sisters, so they see each other often.

My mom (39), her (40) and I (22) were talking about random stuff idk really and everything went fine until Anna made a weird joke about eating pvssy towards my sister (10) after she stuck her tongue out.. 
I wont repeat it on here bc it made my sister and I so uncomfortable, but hope u get a sense of what i mean.

After her joke Anna and my mom were just laughing and then went to another topic again. I was so confused and weirded out i didnt say anything right away, processing what she just said. My sister went into her room afterwards.

Shortly after my mom went to make more coffee, leaving me behind with Anna. 
Thats when i got a grip and told her to stop making such comments about my sister.

Anna then got pissy and said she thought i would appreciate such a joke bc im a lesbian and ""its no big deal"". 
 After that i told her how would i appreciate such a joke from a person thats not even my friend and while kids are around?? Also how she can make such jokes about my sister and make her obviously uncomfortable and then think its funny. 

Well at that point my mom came back and i just got up to take a walk with my dog, bringing my sister along to get out for a while. 
When we came back Anna was gone and my mom was angry with me bc i ""made a fuss over nothing."" 

My Mom still wants me to apologize but i dont think i overreacted or handled that situation poorly but my mom makes me think that and wont talk to me unless i apologize..",Not the A-hole

I saw it when I got home, and so did my brother. We both think it is very cute, and he innocently and excitedly told my parents about it. They were not happy about it.
They were upset that she went into my room because it was messy and they didn’t want her to see my messy room. They asked why I thought it was okay, and I said “I don’t know” to them and apologized - but in my head I didn’t see a problem with it. Was I wrong?",Not the A-hole
AITA for bein upset that postwoman didnt stick to protocole,"
Hello there, i come from country in Europe and we dont have custom-house fee for packages. I ordered thing from guy that lives in state next to me. It came i paid 11€ for that package (price+shipping fee). Like 4 hours later, postwoman comes back again and insist about taking mail back with thing (which i already opened and had in my hands) because we didnt pay custom-house fee. Standart protocol here is that postwoman/postman have to give you a paper, (notification about package bein delivered to post office) but She acted out of protocol and took it with her and gave it to me while it was suppose to play out like this: She gave me notification about package bein in post office and i go to collect it. So because of her doin whatever she wanted to, i had to give her my package without her returnin me my money, i was furious, i called customer service and they told me that there is no custom-house fee. I went to post office and because of this i had to pay 17.80 for some custom-house fee that we dont even have. It took me like 3 hours total and a lot of nerves. And then when i come home (im only 17) i tell my grandparents about it and they told me this: ,,Im actin like a bitch and im ungrateful because postwoman wanted to save me time goin to post office.
Jeez thanks postwomen, you acted on your own out of protokol are and you caused me three hours at post Office and nerves. Am i an asshole?

AITA for turning down last minute work even though I’m not busy?,"I work as a recording engineer at a studio. I mostly like the job and it’s what I trained to do at uni, but I hate how last minute the shifts are. 

I’m technically self employed as a freelance recording engineer and have to invoice the studio for my work, but I only work for this one company and they set my rate of pay, which is £9.30 an hour. This is the minimum living wage for most of the UK but I live and work in London where the minimum living wage is £10.75. Please note employers don’t actually have to pay this much, it’s just the amount determined the minimum you can live on in London. The minimum wage they’re required by law to pay is £8.72 an hour. 

The studio takes bookings from clients wanting studio time with an engineer, who are then assigned to me or one of the other engineers. I’d say about 50% of my client bookings are made 1-3 days before the session, 20% made more than 3 days before the session and 30% on the day of the session. Although it stresses me out not getting bookings until a day or two before the session, I’m happy to do sessions that are booked at least a day in advance. My problem is when I get called on what I thought was going to be a day off being asked if I can come in for a session that same day. I feel like I can never relax on my days off cause I’m always waiting for a call asking me to work. 

Most of these really last minute sessions are booked by amateur rappers who only book the minimum time slot of 2 hours so they can rap over a YouTube beat. They’re often rude and/or late and expect me to run the session two hours from when they arrive regardless of their booked time. 

Because I don’t feel it’s worth it dropping everything to go and work these types of sessions for less than £20, I’ve started saying I’m busy when the studio owner calls asking if I’m available for a session later that day. He’s always fine with it and has never questioned me about it, and technically I’m self employed and can choose when I want to work but I still feel bad and unhelpful for doing this. But then I also feel it’s unfair to expect me to constantly be on call to do a skilled job and only get paid £9.30 an hour for it. Clients pay around £45 an hour at one of our studio locations and £60 an hour at the other to give you an idea of the profit the studio is making. 

Side note: another thing that annoys me is that when clients pay a day rate and I end up finishing the work before the end of the day, I’m expected to deduct these hours and only get paid for the hours I worked even though the client has already paid for the full day. It makes me want to work more slowly so that I don’t finish early and end up missing out on money I was expecting to make. 

Another side note: we are open despite the UK lockdown and this is perfectly legal as the government has allowed recording studios to operate as long as they’re covid secure.

AITA for telling my grandpa I won't call his wife my grandma?,"I (19f) moved away from home for the first time in October with two good friends. It's been cool and everything but there has been one downside. Since the day after I moved out my grandpa has been calling wanting to talk to me about the ""family situation"". We have discussed it three times already and I am trying to not upset him or be a dick but we don't have the same outlook.

Basically my grandma died when my dad and my uncles were kids, my grandpa remarried when my dad was like 9 or 10. My dad does not like my grandpa's wife or consider her to be part of the family, neither do my uncle's. Because of this when I, my siblings and cousins were born she was introduced to us as grandpa's wife. We were all told about our grandma. We all have seen photos and heard stories. And I even have the same name as my grandma. I feel a kind of connection to her through my dad's love for her and the name, plus she sounded like a really cool woman if I'm being truthful. 

My grandpa's wife... I have never been around her much. I have never spent any time alone with her. We saw our grandpa a bit more and have talked and interacted with him but not his wife and to me, I don't have any kind of bond with her beyond knowing her and having seen her for a while. Although I will admit I probably have a better relationship with her than my dad does.

My grandpa never liked how we didn't see her as grandma and didn't treat her as such. He is now trying to change that with me since I'm an adult away from my parents. He wants me to call her grandma. He said it would mean a lot to them and that think of how we want to make the people we love happy and he emphasized that it would make her extremely happy. I told him that it didn't feel natural and that I don't really have a relationship with his wife. I told him that of course I will always be nice but I always remember her being in the background and not really having anything to do with her. He told me that was my dad's fault and I said it was true but that a bond doesn't develop out of nothing and grandma is a title you give to someone you really know. But that I don't really know her that well. He told me I am big enough now to see she should be grandma and to do a kindness for her.

It's awkward for me because I'm not super close to him but he was involved in some things. I remember my siblings and I spending time with him at the beach occasionally and I remember him staying with us for a while during a bad storm once. Those kinds of memories were just him, not both of them. I have nothing like that with her. She was always kind when we were around her but very much in the background.

I don't know if I should do it just for the sake of my grandpa though, because I can tell he's upset by it.

AITA for taking my roommate’s dog to the vet behind her back?,"My roommate is not a very responsible oet owner. She loves her pets but doesn’t take great care of them. Her dog has had some kind of skin condition for a couple months now. Instead of getting her treatment, she keeps buying stuff from amazon and using “natural” remedies. This poor dog has chewed off its fur on her bum and hind legs. It’s been so bad the last couple of days she has been whining and panting and rubbing herself against anything she can.

I suggested a couple times she needs a vet and offered to call around for pricing and roomie agrees but says she doesn’t have the money to spend until her paycheck in ten more days. I know her take home pay and her outgoing bills and am aware of what she blows her money on. It’s not my business but I don’t condone people putting off animal welfare for money reasons when they’re capable of paying and spend the money on personal luxuries instead.

I decided to take her dog in myself today because she was chewing herself bloody. I don’t have the money to blow, but I paid for the service and treatment and let her know afterwards. I told her I would be deducting the cost from rent for the month.

I think I may be the asshole for not informing her beforehand, that’s her position on the matter. I also think that this has gone on long enough and I had tried to approach the topic while staying in my lane and she blew it off so even if IATA, I’m not really gonna apologize about it.

AITA for denying entry to a kid?,"
So not much background need for this, I work at a grocery store and my job is cleaning giving shopping carts to every customer that is able te use one.

TL;DR I deny entry to a kid because of the rules, and manager says I shouldn’t have made a problem of some rollerskates.

I’ve done this for literal days,7am till 9 pm some days for a few months. I know every rule regarding who can come in and who can’t.

There is this one rule that says you can’t enter the store on roller skates for some reason I can’t remember. I got on trouble for letting someone in on roller skates a few weeks ago.

So today a customer (around 35 or something) and her kid ( my guess around 10) on roller skates. I see the roller skates and say “I’m sorry I can’t let you enter with roller skates on.” The lady replies “Well, we were here yesterday and it was no problem.” 

At this point I already know this is gonna be a mild Karen case. So I reply “I am sorry but the rules say you can’t enter on roller skates, I get in trouble if I let her in”. I tell her “She is welcome to wait outside(rural town, almost no crime it’s safe trust me) or here in the entree with me”

Enfin girl waits outside mom enter and does groceries. When she gets to the checkout she’s talking to the checkout ladies, and a few seconds later my manager talks with mom. (I forget to tell I have view of the registers from the entree).

Mom eventually finished talking to my manger handed me her cart and goes out of the store.

My manager swings by and tells me(with no customers around) “If you’re gonna do your job this way, don’t bother coming back tomorrow”. “That lady was here yesterday and it was no problem, it’s confusing that now there is one”.

I thought to myself that I did everything as I should have done. Am I truly and asshole for enforcing the rules on a kid and her mom?

I might be the asshole because she was just a kid, and the roller skates and the story isn’t a real problem in practice.

AITA for not showing my friend empathy?,"I am 23(Andrea), she is 19(Callie). We are both from Malaysian

There was a party we were throwing for our club activity at school, Callie offered her place for us to hold this party at her apartments functions area. The planning was going good until 3 days to the party, she announced that her Mom has left her family and are both going through a divorce. As the organizer of the event I checked with her to she would prefer I shift the event to another venue, she said that it was 'okay, and we put in a lot of effort to organize this'.

Fast forward to the day of the party. I was hanging out with a bunch of my friends and having a good time and engaging them in some harmless banter. Callie (who was not part of the group) comes up to me and starts yelling at me in front of everyone for being rude. This made me super pissed but I didn't confront her, I grabbed my friend left the function area and went into the toilet where I started screaming and chucking the toilet paper at the wall. Someone heard me screaming and told her about it. After venting, I went back to the party and avoided her pretty much the entire night.

I texted her a few days later and told her that I didn't appreciate being yelled at in front of everyone. She then tells me that she didn't want to be friends anymore because throughout this entire episode, I didn't once show her concern.

He often tells people that no others opinion than ourselves is needed, good advice, if he followed it himself. He wasn't popular when he was 11, 12, (and wants to always be, not just my single opinion)  but took of with the teens when inviting them for things our common friends can't afford to do (tho we live in the end of the world, his parents own some big money). 

It's the kind of thing that you feel bad if you don't accept, since he pays for beach trips, shopping mall tours (we don't have a single outlet in my town, let alone a mall), and trips to local tourism.

He also starts approaching people when he has some kind of interest in them, but not in a good way, and gets pissed when doesn't get what wants. He told other people that he does this, so he doesn't hide it.

But over all of that, I get along with him, since I don't let his mind games bother me, turn some of his ideas and behavior off and actually am really close to him.

AITA for telling about a secret baptism?,"Not that it matters but I am male and 32.  So I'll just get right into it...my father who is very religious decided that he would perform a secret baptism on my niece and followed through with it.  I over heard him on the phone with one of his friends as he was explaining how he went to the church, told the church what he wanted to do and got some holy water.  Now keep in mind a couple of different things, one he was on the phone in front of me, I was not creeping behind the door or in the shadows or something like that.  He knew full well I was sitting on the couch but he admitted he wasn't thinking when he spoke.  Two, my sister and her fiancé have made it abundantly clear several times that they are not catholic and will not be getting any kids they have baptized.  Hence why he did this in secret in his room with my mother who claims she told him not too and didn't willingly participate.  

I asked him flat out ""Who do you think you are?  What gives you the right?"" and he just replied ""It's already done.""  He is acting as if he has done nothing wrong.  I then said to him ""If you don't think you did anything wrong why don't you tell her (my sister) yourself instead of hiding it?""  He once again said ""It's already done"" and he won't admit fault or discuss it further.  Both he and my mother keep telling me to keep my mouth shut and why do I need to say anything and create a family problem.  I told them that my father created the family problem when he did a freaking secret baptism.  I feel that I should say something to her because if it was my child I would want to know and because she's my sister and she should be able to trust that her requests and decisions be honored by her family plus she's having another baby in May.  I am in recovery and have been sober for well over a year now and I have been living such a honest life and I feel so free that I don't have to lie about ANYTHING any more.

Well, today she decided to come into my room (unannounced) to talk about my schoolwork. I was in the middle of meditating but didn't really mind, until she started absent-mindedly cleaning while we talked. 

I was pretty mad but kept it to myself, until she got to the altar I have set up on a shelf. I don't like people touching it and always cleanse it with sage if someone does because it has crystals and things that hold power (in my opinion).

I told her, slightly blunter than I had intended, not to touch it. She asked why, so I explained that it's sacred to me and it feels tainted if others mess with it. She got defensive, saying that she was only watering my plant (she wasn't). She started yelling that it was ""b*llshit anyway"" and that it was offensive to tell her she ruined it. 

She then aggressively wiped my crystals, dropping two in the process, and ""straightened up"" the cloth underneath everything. I got mad and yelled that it didn't matter if she believed it, I did and she should respect that. She called me ungrateful because she bought half of it by giving me allowance.

Two of my stepsiblings are older than me and the other three are younger. My dad attempted to cut her off from me because she was buying me gifts and seeing me but not them. It didn't work and my sister made sure our relationship continued and then eventually I started insisting too.

Then over Christmas my stepsister (17f) blurted out during Christmas dinner that it sucked how much my sister hated them and how she and her siblings always felt unwanted and left out when my sister would go so far to hang out with me and keep in touch but they never had a real conversation with her before and she didn't have any interest in them. My half siblings started crying and then it basically became a thing where my dad and his wife (we have a very tense history which is why I don't call her my stepmom) tried to demand I stop seeing my sister, that I stop accepting gifts from her, that I cut all ties.

My dad's wife then told me it's either them or her and I told her I would choose my sister every time.

My dad then told me I am being awful and passing up on making my ""siblings"" feel better by showing I don't like how they are being treated and stop hanging out with the person who treats them like that. I told him my sister is my sibling and she's the one who I have the closer bond with despite not being around her as much.

AITA Roommate issues- the saga,"My roommate and I have highkey been at odds for months. We’re both college freshmen and live off campus. The landlord is family friends with my parents and that’s basically it. 

Overall my roommate isn’t too appreciative of criticism from anyone and I learned this pretty early on. From how she treated me after I brought up issues like her leaving me stranded on campus, throwing crazy parties, or drinking excessively. So I tried to avoid bringing up issues regardless of how uncomfortable they made me unless it resulted in a breach of my safety/privacy- or jeopardized my studies. So I put up with a lot as a result. But being that agreeable got us into trouble by the end of the semester. 

After break I returned with a new sense of self, mostly because my parents were there supporting me since I’d told them everything my roommate had been doing thus far. My roommate continued to react poorly to my  complaints/requests and after a few weeks of frequent boundary setting I decided that I was tired of it and told my mother I wanted to come home to finish out the semester. My mom told the landlords and they were horrified that I wanted to leave so they wanted to have a talk with me. I misunderstood it as it being a conversation about how to “deal” with her instead of just basic conflict resolution and I decided to share with the roommate since I didn’t want her to be blindsided by whatever the conversation led to. She kept asking what made my mother so upset that she felt the need to contact the landlord and I listed a few things that I was upset with although I reassured her that I wasn’t upset because she didn’t know (I obviously went out of my way to not let her know) and I was more emotionally exhausted from processing that than directly upset with he although she’d made it very difficult in these last few weeks. and she said I was terrible for not communicating with her (which she mentioned because that was my biggest complaint for her) and then in the middle of the night she left during this huge snowstorm to go down the mountain we live on which is incredibly unsafe. And makes me really nervous on her behalf. 

So aita for not sharing my earliest complaints? I feel like I’m not since my initial fears were confirmed through her actions. But I can’t shake this feeling of guilt. My landlord/parents/friends/ and rommates ex friends agree that I’m in the right. So why do I feel so guilty

AITA For telling my roommate to stop bugging our new roommate over cooking dinner,"(Obligatory on mobile) For some background, my (25f) have roomed with my roommate “Hannah”  (23f) for two years. We’re not friends, but we are friendly, and we do run in the same kind of groups due to both being engineering students. Note: We are both seniors in college. Now, we got a new roommate (19f), who I’ll call Sara, a little over three weeks ago. She was placed in our apartment after her previously roommates basically harassed, stole from her, etc.  it honestly breaks my heart that her first year of college shes already had to go through all that.  Bad roommates happen, I’ve been their too, but the police literally had to be called on her old roommates it got so nightmarish.

Now the ”issue.” When Sara first moved in, she was super excited to be here (still is). Our apartment doesn’t smell like literal dog shit, the kitchen is clean, there’s not stains everywhere, and the living room while a little sparse doesn’t look like a rave threw up on it. She was so excited that she offered to cook us dinner after she’d finished getting all settled in. I thought this was sweet and Hannah was super excited. Then, as things typically go in college, things got busy.  I’m fairly certain Sara forgot, she was probably just so excited to have “normal” roommates that she didn’t really take into account her busy schedule. Which honestly? I didn't really expect a follow through from the offer anyway, if she had it would have been awesome but she’s been a chill roommate so far and I super neat and not loud (literally all I could ask for in a roommate). Hannah though keeps wanting to bug her about the dinner, sending me messages about it, wondering if she should ask her when it’s going to happen, etc. to which I eventually just told her it probably isn’t going to happen and to just drop it, I was honestly tired of hearing about it.Hannahs sulking, which means her boyfriends irritated that he has to put up with her attitude, and he’s now bugging my boyfriend to tell me to apologize so that he doesn’t have to deal with her sulking (he showed me the texts). I don’t see why I should, my boyfriends backing me up, but some of our mutual friends are saying I should just “be the bigger person and apologize”. So Reddit, AITA? Apparently my snapping at Hannah has really upset her and it is causing tension between my boyfriend and his friend (Hannah’s boyfriend) which is why I think I might be edging into asshole territory.",Not the A-hole
AITA for commenting on my girlfriend’s driving,"So I’m (28m) in a relatively new relationship with this woman (30f) named Jennifer. I haven’t ridden with Jennifer too often yet since we usually go to one another’s houses to hang out (for obvious reasons). 

I have ridden with her a few times, and I’ve noticed she never uses her blinker (turn signal) when changing lanes or making a turn. I kept my mouth shut about it since it’s a new relationship and I didn’t wanna come off as critical. 

The other day I was riding with her and she came up to a red light and turned right without coming to a complete stop, which is illegal in my state. I made a comment about it and she said “oh no one was coming it’s fine, no big deal”. I pushed back and said what if someone she couldn’t see was coming up fast? She just brushed it off. A few minutes later she made a turn and I also at that point mentioned how she never uses her blinker. 

She got kind of annoyed and made a big show of using her blinker the rest of the ride. I apologized for perhaps being nit picky or piling on about her driving and she basically told me I was being critical. 

I tried to make it clear I don’t want to belittle her ability to drive and that the only reason I said anything about either issue is because both of those behaviors can make it more likely to get into an accident. If it was a quirk or something I just didn’t personally like or agree with I wouldn’t have cared. She told me she’s been driving for a long time and hasn’t been in an accident because of either of those tendencies so it’s not big deal. 

I ended up apologizing and saying I wouldn’t comment on her driving anymore. I realize this is only my side of the story, and while I tried really hard to say everything in a kind and caring way, it’s possible it came off less that way than I wanted it to. I don’t want to bring it up again, but it does genuinely kind of bother me.

AITA for being difficult about my food allergies with my sister?,"So I (18F) have dairy and nut allergies, and after having been exposed to them a few times over the years, my doctor found out I was allergic to them through the allergy tests. 

My sister M (22F) got engaged a few months ago, and asked for us to come to her place once a month to help with her wedding preparations with her fiancé (23M). 

When my mother and I come, we have a nice home cooked meal while we work on our planning and discussing, and the problem that’s been occurring at each of them is that my sister dislikes accommodating to my food allergies. 

I’ve already explained to her many times how food allergies work, and she keeps saying that she forgets or thinks it’s dumb. They like to cook food with butter, cheese, and something with nuts and since I can’t have it I’ve had to find other options. 

She says that I can just pick it out, and after having a few allergic reactions over the past few years, which she’s caused two of them so she knows what happens when I have them, I really didn’t want to go through it again. 

I can’t bring my own food order, can’t order it, can’t go get it, can’t bring ingredients to make my own, so I’m basically stuck sitting there drinking water. They said they don’t have enough space for me to do that on their table or their fridge, and we would lose time if I did that. I eat before or after the planning, but I still get hungry since I’m there for a while because she wants us to stay a few extra hours.

She gets upset when I waste their cooking by not eating it because I can’t, but they say they don’t have extra ingredients to make more. I offer money to help out, offer to cook, but it’s still a matter of how they want to handle things their own way.

I guess I’m just stuck between whether or not I just suck it up since it’s her one special day of her life, or trying to keep reasoning with her about it. My sister has expressed her feelings about how she’s hurt and upset over it, saying that I don’t like their cooking or don’t want to eat with them. My mother said it’s unfortunate, but if they don’t want us bringing or cooking our own things, we have to do things their way.

So AITA for causing problems about my food allergies with my sister?

Edit: For those telling me to just not go anymore, well my sister and her fiancé only invited less than 10 people because they don’t have many other family or friends. So there isn’t much people to help with their planning. 

My mother says that my sister is wrong for doing that, but my future bil said that he supports my sister no matter what and this is what they want.",Not the A-hole
AITA for being mad at my friend for being destructive in my own bedroom,"I live in a house with 2 other friends. They had our mutual friends over while I was away, and one of them got really drunk and crashed in my bedroom, but in doing so pushed a large pile of clean laundry off the bed and onto the ground, then managed to spill an entire gallon of tea on it (don't ask why there was so much tea there, haha).

The next morning, they messaged me that they cleaned up but they clearly didn't properly check, because somehow they didn't notice the massive spill at all. So the stains set in and are absolutely impossible to get out.

One of my housemates is trying to defend the drunk friend that it was an accident and that it's not a big deal basically, and sort of framing it like cleaning up after our close friend's messes is natural and expected.

AITA for snapping at my dad after I almost crash us both into another car?,"I've been slowly learning how to drive for about 1.5 -2 years now. I'm absolutely terrified of driving so I've been putting off learning due to my fear. My mom got into an accident when I was a toddler, with me in the car, and never drove again so I think my reservations stem from that.

I've been practicing with an instructor but my dad has driving with me on the side. He's super adamant about me being able to drive; I supposed it stems from being embarrassed. The children of all his friends started driving as soon as it was legal to do so then theres me, 22, and still too scared to get the final leg of my licence.

Every time we hit the road together we argue. I'll admit, I drive a bit like a grandma - I'm always under the limit, I turn slow, I wait for there to be no cars around me before I make a move on turning, etc. He hates that. He's constantly on my case about being too timid, gripping the wheel too hard or driving so slowly. I get even more nervous under his scrutiny and make mistakes - then he gets on my case about having been practicing for so long and still making them. We always fall into this feedback loop.

Today, as we were driving together, I was waiting for a car to pass before I turned into a plaza. He insisted I could go before the car got too close, I said I'd rather wait, he started yelling at me so I freaked out, hit the gas to turn (in my head the car was too close so I went super fast) and missed hitting another car in the plaza by the skin of my teeth. Imagine the stereotypical slamming on the brakes movie moment.

So of course I went off, got out the car screaming like a lunatic, refused to get back behind the wheel and demanded he drive us the rest of the way. He started screaming at me for ""giving up"" and ""not understanding why at my age I just can't be comfortable driving after all this time."" He drove us home in silence.

I've tried explaining that I'm afraid, and frankly hate driving. I don't choose to be nervous it's just how I am and I'm working on it at my own pace. He insists I'm holding myself back, driving is something done by millions across the globe and theres no reason for me to be so apprehensive, I'm the way I am because I'm stubborn, everyone else is excited to drive, blah blah blah.

I feel bad because to be fair, he goes out of his way to drive with me. He offered to pay for my lessons and is actively trying to get me ready to take the final driving test. My father has always expressed a desire for me to drive because he thinks its important that as an adult I have that skill. AITA?

Edit: typo

Clarification: just want to add that I actively use public transportation or walk. I'm happy with this. Since I grew up a mother who did not drive herself, she taught me how to get wherever I needed to go without having to rely on a car. I don't even use uber's or take taxi's as a means of proving to my father that I am good without a car being involved at all.

AITA for not telling a friend about what had happened between me and her ex?,"I met this couple through my ex, Emma and Luke. Eventually we all split up but remained part of the same friend group. Emma and I became good friends. I also became friends with Emma’s sister June and her best friend Rachel. About 2 years later Emma moved abroad and started a new relationship. Because she’s far away, we’re not as close anymore but I still consider her a friend. 

One night I end up at a party and Luke is there. We all get drunk and I feel like he’s coming onto me? But I also don’t believe it because there’s never been anything even remotely ambiguous between us. I actually always thought that he disliked me back when I was dating my ex. We end up in the kitchen drunk and reminiscing about the past and suddenly he kisses me. I’m so confused and surprised and I can’t think straight. But I don’t stop him. Suddenly we’re making out and we end up sleeping together. 

The next day I want to tell Emma but I feel weird about it because 1. I can’t tell her personally 2. it’s been such a long time since she was with Luke and 3. we have grown apart since she moved. I felt awkward scheduling a call in a different time zone to say “I slept with that ex you probably forgot about”. I would rather tell her personally when I’d get the chance. I considered asking her sister June for advice but she was in therapy at the time and hard to reach. So I put off telling anyone anything.

Some time later Luke has a work thing in the country where Emma lives (which I didn’t know) and they meet up. They go for drinks and he tells her we slept together. Later Emma and Rachel talk on the phone and Emma mentions what happened between me and Luke. Rachel *flips out*. She shows up in front of my door screaming horrible things at the top of her lungs. She says that I’m a horrible friend, that what I did is inexcusable, that I should have never slept with Luke, that she will never be able to trust me around her ex-boyfriends... She makes it sound like everyone thinks these things about me. I’m shocked and immediately break down in tears. After she’s done yelling, she leaves. 

That night I get a message from June saying Emma would like to talk to me. I call Emma, I apologize to her for not telling her sooner and Emma is wonderful about the whole thing. She says that her dating Luke feels like it happened in another lifetime and that both him and I should be able to enjoy our lives. She’s okay with what happened and so is her sister. She says that she would have preferred to know it from me though and I 100% agree with her and apologize for this. 

Rachel however is still fuming. She refused to be around me for a time and expected me to bow out of common social events, which I didn’t. This happened a year ago and although she can tolerate being in the same room as me now, she still thinks I’m a massive asshole and that I shouldn’t be there. I feel like she’s overreacting but I also wonder if maybe Emma and June are just too nice and I am in fact an asshole?",Not the A-hole

AITA for discussing finances within earshot of my sibling?,"Background first. I'm 28, male, live in a basement apartment in a house I own. I work as a consultant in the engineering field and make ok money (usually around $75k USD/year, sometimes more sometimes less). I am not great at saving money, so I use investment accounts and similar stuff to automate it. Sister is 26, lives with her boyfriend in a house he owns, works a decent job in retail.

My sister happened to be visiting at the same time and was in the next room over. Shortly after I finished my conversation with my mom, sister came in and complained that me discussing finances ""in front of her"" was rude and boastful.

AITA for wanting my husband to get a proper job instead of trying to go “viral” with his Mr Bean doll?," My(24f) husband(32m) lost his job at the start of the pandemic so I have become the sole earner in the house whilst he “tries” to find a new job. He has had no luck so far and his general mood has taken a bit of a downturn. He has always been very “online” and this was one of the things that we first bonded over.

A couple of weeks ago he used our joint account to purchase a 12” tall mr bean figure(£150) without asking me, which I thought was very irresponsible, and not the wisest use of our limited money, but if I thought it if lifts his mood and that helps motivate him to get a job then perhaps it would be worth it.

I don’t know where he got the idea from but he asked if we could basically replicate the ‘elf on the shelf’ thing but with the mr bean figure, where he would get in trouble every night and then my husband could wake up and find out what has gone on and post his reactions on his socials. I am pretty busy with work but I again thought it would only take a few minutes and if it lifts his mood then it would be worth it.

Most days I have been coming home and he hasn’t even cleaned up the split flour or beans that I arranged the night before. Although I have tried talking to my husband and explaining that I am very busy with working at the hospital, and keeping the house afloat, and that it would be nice if he could support me by doing some housework but it hasn’t made much difference.

The last couple of days I have arranged mr bean to be looking at a self help book(that I bought for my husband) one night, and some job adverts that I found online that would suit my husbands skills, however this has upset him greatly and he says that I am trying to ruin any chance that he has to go viral due to my jealousy. His mum messaged me today saying that she doesn't know if I have noticed that my husband is having a really tough time and that she is disappointed that i would be so unsupportive, so I assume that he has told her his version of events. He is barely communicating with me now and wouldn’t come down this evening when I’d cooked his favourite meal.

my parents don't approve of me accepting the money cause they think it's dirty money, unfair to my sister and wrong because I never speak to them. I understand where they're coming from but I'm a teenager, I never have money.

AITA for telling my boyfriend he needs to do his spare of chores?,"I (30F) have been living with my boyfriend (29M) for 2 years now. There is a huge wealth gap beetween us. I am a fast food worker and make minimum wage. On the other hand, he managed to climb the social ladder pretty quickly. He comes from a very poor family of first gen immigrants (european origins) but, being a sort of math genius, managed to go through college thanks to scholarships and graduated in quantitative finance, landed a A+++ tier job and built a consistent wealth from that. He quit his job 2 years ago and has been living on passive income (most rental property and trading) since then.

We have separate accounts (my idea since I want to be independent and not a leech), but he makes sure there is no luxury gap between us: we live in his own house, he pays all the bills/groceries and for our annual vacations and dinner at fancy restaurants. He also paid my students debt off. I cannot contribute to the expenses cause I make too little, but I plan to start contributing after I get a better job (I just graduated in women studies and I am looking for an upgrade, but covid sucks...).

We split the chores evenly, but while I have to do them all by myself he hired a f\*\*\*ing maid to do his share even though I am the one working 40h/week whereas he stays all day at home ""managing his investments"". I hate this and think he should start doing something because I am really stressed out while he is living his best life. On the other hand, he says that he is doing his part, just not by himself, and offered to pay for the maid to do my share also. I am furious cause he is missing the point. Is my request unreasonable?

UPDATE: Ok so to make it short I suck and I realised this. I apologised for making a scene and now the maid is doing all the chores. I realised that I need to work hard to build actual financial stability and that up to now he is the best thing I ever had in my life, and it's not only because of financial sustain but also a lot more (he gives me daily massages, took a chef course to make sure the meal at home are always good and so on).

AITA for washing my girlfriend’s couch blanket with the blanket our dogs sleep on?,"So there’s a little bit of history to this, and I want to provide full details so I can be properly judged. Worth noting is, this is in no way a relationship breaker, so save your “she’s toxic, leave her”s or “your toxic, she should leave you”s. We’re both long over it.

That being said, my girlfriend and I have this longstanding disagreement about pets and household items. For example, in the past, if I had leftovers I wanted to give the dogs, I’d just put them on a regular plate, and put it on the ground for the dogs to enjoy. She thinks that is gross. She thinks if a dog eats off and licks the plate, that it’s now a dog plate, and that we should no longer use it. My thinking is that washing a plate thoroughly is washing a plate. There aren’t permanent dog cooties that stick to plates. Clean is clean... but in any event, I stopped doing that and now put leftovers in their bowls because I don’t really care, and if it matters to her, that’s fine.

So the more recent situation that came up, and the subject of this post, is that we have a couch blanket my girlfriend loves. I often use it when I’m laying on the couch, and the (small) dogs often lay on top of me and hence on top of the blanket. My girlfriend has been fine with this.

My gf works nights, so one day a few weekends ago, I was doing laundry during the day, when she was asleep, and I wanted to wash the blanket that we put on top of the dogs’ bed. Since I was washing blankets, I threw in the couch blanket. I didn’t think anything of it.

When she woke up and we were talking about our days as she was getting ready for work, I was saying I did this, that, and the other, and btw I washed the dog’s blanket and our couch blanket because they were getting stinky. “You didn’t wash them together, did you?”

Now according to her, I ruined her favorite blanket. She was really mad. Again, to me, clean is clean. I frankly don’t get it. I won’t do it again because now I know it pisses her off, but I really don’t get it. I might be the asshole because I knew she had a thing about mixing human and animal stuff. AITA?",Asshole
WIBTA if I ask my mil to do my child’s hair,"Long story short I 24f was exposed to COVID and had to leave my two children 3f and 1f with their grandparents. My children weren’t exposed to me or the person who gave it to me. They have been sweet enough to take care of them until I’m COVID free. 

I usually FaceTime them and would see that my daughters hair was not done. She has curly hair so I try my best to finger curl her hair or at least gather it up so she looks presentable. Mind you, I don’t do it all the time because at the end of the day she’s a kid. Well today they had a small cake (only people who lived in the house) and no one did her hair. Not even a lazy ponytail or anything. It kind of ticked me off because I always make sure she looks presentable when I know it’s a family gathering or there’s going to be pictures. 

I feel like messaging my mil if she could please try to do my daughters hair at least a little bit but I don’t want to be rude. Would I be an asshole if I bring it up ?


Edit: thank you for everyone who nicely made me see that I indeed would be the asshole if I pointed it out. I would like to add that they also have curly hair and often would point out when I didn’t do my girls hair. Which is a huge reason why I was thinking of bringing it up.

AITA for not making my daughter tell her friend's mom where the friend is?,"  

My daughter (19F) has a friend, Isla, with a complicated home life. I don’t know all the particulars, but from what Isla’s mom (a friend of mine) has said and from what my daughter told me, no one is in the right. They haven’t always been great parents (from Isla's mom own admission); she has also put them through utter hell (even my daughter has said this). It was decided in family therapy between Isla and her parents that she move out at 18. According to Isla herself, it was the best thing for her and them, and that their relationship is all the better for it. The last time I talked to any of them, they were doing well. 

Myself, my daughter and Isla’s parents live in the suburb of a larger city. Isla lives in the actual city. Even during the pandemic, she has taken a train to visit her parents or they’ll go to her, about once a week. This Wednesday, I got a frantic call from Isla’s mother telling me that Isla never showed up at the train and asking if my daughter had heard from her. I asked my daughter and she agreed to call Isa. However, when they got in touch, my daughter said she was no longer interested in helping. Isla’s mom got upset and said that as a mom, I should convince my daughter to tell her. All my daughter would say is that “Isla is safe”. I finally decided to just end the conversation and told Isla’s mom that I’d let her know if there were any updates, but that according to my daughter, she was safe.

My daughter still won’t talk about it in depth, but mostly says that she doesn’t want to be the go between. She says she’s been talking to Isla and sharing more with Isla’s mom would ruin her relationship with Isla. I respected that. Isla’s mom is getting increasingly upset and is saying if this was my daughter, I’d want to know. And as a mom, I do feel torn. But ultimately, I trust my daughter.

AITA for buying my (21M) stepmom (50F) a burger of her own because she keeps picking food off of me and my sibling’s plates?,"My stepmom is a nutritionist. She’s always about eating the right foods, meal prep, fresh groceries, etc. Occasionally, my dad (52M), my siblings (21F, 20M, and 23M), and I like to get some junk food (we call these “junk-ups”) on the weekend. 
Now the problem: since forever, my stepmom has 1) told us that we’re going to die because we’re eating fatty foods (I promise, we only eat junk food on the weekends, or on special occasions, the last time i had anything unhealthy was my my sister’s birthday a few weeks ago) and 2) come in while we’re eating with a plate for herself and picks the foods she wants from each of our plates. Whenever me or one of my siblings questioned this she would tell us “you’re being disrespectful” , “shut up, I can eat what I want”, or “it would be a waste of time to buy me one because I don’t want one”. I want to make it clear that she does not buy any of the food for our junk-ups. Either I buy for everyone or one of my siblings do. 
Just yesterday, we decided to get burger. This time, I bought food and one of my siblings said “You know what? Get mom one too because you know she’ll just pick off of our plates anyways.” and my dad grumbled something about her not liking that but I didn’t care. I figured she would come around to us buying her a burger too, perhaps she felt excluded which was definitely not our intention. 
When we got home and set our plates to eat, in came my step mom with her own plate and before she could start picking, I put the wrapped burger on her plate and said “Here you go. That was ones all yours. No need to pick at our plates now.” 
She was infuriated with me and screamed at my dad to do something about me and went on and on about how I was being disrespectful towards her and that I needed to learn to share and that I’m too old to be selfish. I just sat there, unwrapped my burger, and ate. My siblings later told me that maybe we shouldn’t have done that because now my stepmom has been stewing about it for some time now. AITA?

EDIT: I went to do my laundry and nap and when I came back, I saw that my post blew up! Thank you for your advice and the Reddit silver!

While all of that was fun, my mom would prioritize things that either she wanted to do or what others wanted from her when it could wait as they were not important. The things my mom wanted to get done or what others wanted from her were things like checking something at the store, visiting someone, and even helping a friend or relative over something that all could have waited the next day. This has happened more and more often. So much so that my mom ruined our holiday (We celebrate Eid) for me and my sisters......and twice! The last straw for me was when I asked me mom if she and my grandma would like to go to dinner with me and I would be treating them. My mom was delighted and said she would love to. However, just as we were about to go, my mom said we should visit an aunt. She claimed that it would be an hour but an hour turned into two, and then three. By then it was 10pm and the restaurant was closed. I was really really upset by this since once again, my mom prioritized her needs and wants, over dinner plans. This visit also could have waited the next day, so when I told my mom how upset I was about it she said she ""forgot"" as she ""just got the call"". 

&#x200B;

After that incident, me and my sisters would make plans without my mom knowing and when my mom would ask us where we were going, we would make something up as my mom would begin to not recognize that we have plans and that we can't just drop our plans over her own as we have work and school so it is not easy for us to reschedule our plans. It worked for a while, but when my mom found out what we were doing, she blew up on us for excluding her and when we explained that she views her plans as more important than our and makes us go with her, my mom did not listen and tried to guilt trip us into cancelling our plans.

AITA For making my son lock his dog up for the sake of our cat?,"My wife and I have two children (24M and 15F) our son has a big German Shepherd type dog, and our daughter has a cat, a very sweet young man. We have a twenty three year old cat also. 

Our son recently moved back in with us, and naturally brought his dog with him. He's a great family dog, but he does not get along with cats. He's never hurt them, but he does chase them, and while the male can outrun the dog, the female can't. She has a heart murmur and cats can have heart attacks if they get too stressed/scared (or go into shock), so it's an accident waiting to happen. 

The male cat is also very stressed out, but while worried, we think he will be fine if a little spooked. Our daughter is terrified (she's scared of dogs anyway, hence us having cats) and the dog was just causing a lot of problems. 

Because of this we gave our son two options; rehome the dog or keep him in his room. Our son took to keeping the dog in his room and taking him for extra walks. My wife and I feel bad, but the cats were here first, and our lady is so old now. She probably hasn't got long left (vets gave her about a year before her health starts deteriorating, but that's only a speculation). She deserves to spend her last year happy and healthy. 

Our son is angry because they're just cats and can have a much smaller living space, it's cruel to keep such a large dog cooped up. We told him we understand, and it's not the best, but until he stops chasing cats he isn't permitted in the rest of the house. 

We understand it isn't fair, but it's the only option. My wife thinks we could section the house off a little, but I disagree. The cats were here first. Besides, the dog can jump gates, and there's not really any doors we can use to section a larger part of the house off.

WIBTA if I got a snake despite my roommates girlfriend thinking they’re gross and my roommate changing his mind about getting one,"So I (22f) have lived with my roommate (25m) for the last 2 years. It’s my house, and I rent out the other bedroom. Before he moved in, I talked to him about my plans of getting a African egg eating snake. He told me he had no issues with snakes and thought they were cool, as long as we agreed he didn’t have to feed it. I’ve been saving up and researching these last few years because I want to be fully prepared. I’ve had snakes before but this is a snake I have no experience with so I want to get everything right, including tank and heat needs, etc etc etc.

A few months ago, my roommate got a girlfriend. She’s not my cup of tea but he likes her and she seems perfectly pleasant so it’s fine. She doesn’t live with us. 

When my roommate moved in, we agreed that the snakes enclosure would be in the living room because our bedrooms are small, but our living room is absolutely huge and has the space for the enclosure I want. 

I was buying some things online in our living room when his girlfriend plops down next to me and asked what I was doing. I told her and she said she didn’t like that and thought snakes were gross. I told her that sucked. 

That night my roommate told me he didn’t think getting a snake was a good idea anymore because his girlfriend thought they were gross and he didn’t want her to be uncomfortable. I told him I wouldn’t set up the enclosure in the living room anymore but I was still getting the snake and make due having the enclosure in my space. 

He told me he didn’t agree to it anymore and if I got the snake, I would be being a shitty roommate for not respecting him and his girlfriends wishes


Would I be the asshole if I got the snake anyway?

WIBTA If I write a tell-all book about my relationship with my family?,"I’d written about how my parents had put me in the same class and assigned me to be the caretaker of my older sister with autism online on Facebook and this made our relatives and friends knows about it. But I’d been thinking for a while now that I want to write a tell-all book about how I’m forced to my mom’s shrink because I’m the one she confided in and told me not to tell anyone else. Because I’m an empath listening to her venting made me despised my dad growing up. And I later learnt through conversations she’d had with our family friend that she’d used me as a person to go against my dad in their conflict.

She’d told this friend to use her own child to get involved in the conflict she’s having with her husband. Despite all complaints made my parents insisted that they did nothing wrong that I should keep my mouth shut about how they’d let me take care of my older sister at the age of 12 and while I was abused and blamed by my mentally ill older sister they watched it happened and told me to suck it up.

Mother likes to make complaints about half-siblings too and although I dislike them it’s not as if I wanted to harm them I just wanted to get back at them. I want to write this book so that everyone knows what it’s like and perhaps earn some money.

Everyone in my family would be furious with me if I chose to do this because it’ll ruin the image they’d painstakingly painted for others to see.

AITA for not caring about my 3 year old’s fashion,"Long time lurker, first time poster. And a pretty low stakes question. 

My wife and I have a 3 year old girl. Sometimes she picks out her clothes and sometimes she wants one of us to. On the occasions that I pick them out, I put zero thought or effort into finding pants and a shirt that “match”. I pull out pants at random and pull out a shirt at random. I physically could not care any less that my toddler’s clothes follow the pattern deemed by a random fashion mogul as “matching” and the three year old has no problem with it. 

My wife thinks I am being lazy and should train my child to match clothes. AITA?

Edit: seems like it might be important to add that we have a 4 month old as well and he is held the majority of the time right now so if one of us is busy and the other is taking care of both of them, it’s not so simple to go through clothes to pick stuff out

This happened again for Christmas and now my aunt has a rat infestation that we are dealing with, she asked if she could sleep at our house on the couch and my mom said she could sleep in my room without asking me.

I know this is petty but this gives me anxiety and makes me irritated. I think im the ah and my moms gets irritated when I say I don't want them sleeping in my room.

Also I'm in my room almost all day. I have bipolar disorder and maybe this is me being irrational. If I am I want to know and correct the behavior.

The first thing is when my brother and his wife come over his wife almost broke my computer my sitting down her and my brothers bags which were quite heavy, the wife puts her stuff all over my room and some other things happened and im not really comfortable with them being in my room.
Second thing is I have absolutely no problem with my aunt staying with her house being the way it is. She works 3rd shift so I can't go in there during the day.

AITA for taking a friends vape?,"So I 15m have a friend 15m and we joke around with each other a lot, mainly by just taking each other’s shit. 

So I take his vape from his blazer during PE. Then later on when he mentions he can’t find it, I say teachers where doing a checks on students blazers cuz someone was caught selling vape shit. And he should prob expect to be called up any time now.

Now I said this expecting him to know it’s bs and just roll his eyes it something and ask me for it back. But he’s a bit slow and thought I was 100% serious. (It’s comical he fell for this as teachers literally can’t look through your shit without you there.) 

And he’s freaking tf out especially since apparently it was thc in there (I don’t see why he was panicking about that specifically, I don’t see them checking that shit but I don’t use that stuff so maybe it’s apparent?) so he’s getting absolutely fucked.

So I let him panic for a bit then just hand it back to him, but he goes mental and looked like he was on the verge of tears and shouts at me to fuck off and call me an annoying cunt.

"AITA for ""not being chatty or giggly"" around my mother after being told repeatedly that my voice and laugh are annoying?","((Sorry about formatting, on mobile)) 
So, I (18F; staying with mom until I graduate high school) have a loud laugh and voice. I usually talk more when I'm hanging out with my friends on Discord. I live with my mom and visit dad 3 weekends a month. I can't tell you how many times I've been told to shut up, to stop talking to my friends, and that my voice is overly irritating, that my laugh is weird and annoying, and so on by my own mom. She makes comments like ""you have a laugh that sounds like a tone-deaf hyena"" and ""your voice is too loud and obnoxious."" I've gotten to the point after 5 years of just not speaking (unless spoken to) or not laughing when she's around. She asked me today why I'm not chatty or laugh anymore, and I said that she was the reason why and even explained that her remarks about my voice and laugh hurt me. What does she do? Tell me to stop being sensitive and to get over it because she's ""just messing with me."" I didn't respond and went to my room after eating. I guess she told my aunt because she's been texting me, calling me an ah and saying I need to apologize to my mother for being childish and bratty.

AITA for refusing to speak to my boyfriend in his native language?," My boyfriend (28 M) and I (26 F) have been together for a few years. I spoke his native language (my third language) a bit before we met, and being around him all the time I became quite fluent. Last night, he told me that he's tired of hearing me speak his native language and we should switch to English (second language for both of us) more often. The reason is that, in his word, it's like talking to a parrot since I mimic his accent and use the same expressions he uses. Obviously I don't do it on purpose, it's just that I mostly learnt the language from him. He added that his brother's ex girlfriend makes a really funny imitation of me since apparently the way I speak is ""funny"", but it's nothing personal.

I got really defensive and my reaction was a bit over the top. I told him that the his brother's ex girlfriend is dumb and I always knew that, so her little show comes as no surprise (which now I regret saying), and that I don't want to sound like a parrot to him so from now on we'll just speak English all the time. He said that I'm super dramatic and I cannot take a joke. I am not impressed by people who make fun of non-native speakers, but maybe my reaction was excessive and I shouldn't be so offended.

AITA for not making more coffee at work?,"*Will add a TL:DR at the end*

So as a little bit of a backstory, I have a problem coworker. He has had issues with basically everybody in the past. I will give him the initial A. 

Today him and I briefly had a disagreement because one of our sales people had a customer come in but she wasn’t available at the time to help her customer so I asked my manager what to do and he asked A if he could go unlock the RV for the customer and we’d call him if it was his turn. When I asked A to do it, he refused to do it. I told him that he needed to go speak to the manager and he also refused our managers request. A then asked me to make more coffee. As I was walking back to the break room, my manager told me not to do it because he didn’t think that it was fair that A wasn’t being a team player so I shouldn’t be expected to make coffee for him. 

When I told A that I wouldn’t be making the coffee, he said I’ve never been able to think for myself and claimed that I needed a manager to make every decision for me which is not true. I told him that I wasn’t gonna let him bully me into doing something and that he could make coffee if he really wanted to. He didn’t even end up making it because he just wanted me to do it. 

My manager applauded me for not letting A bully me into doing something when he didn’t do something for me, but A was in a bad mood the rest of the day and started complaining to the rest of our coworkers. Everybody defended me but I feel like he was trying to make me look bad. I’m wondering if I should’ve just let him and the manager work it out. 

I also feel like I had a bit of a conflict with myself because if other people had wanted coffee they also had to miss out. I think it would’ve been best if I would’ve just made it seem like I wanted the coffee and that it was something that everybody could benefit from. I also feel like the asshole because I didn’t take the highroad. Finally I don’t want to make these issues common or make it seem like I’m trying to leverage some thing in order to get what I want.

AITA for putting daughter in part time daycare?,"My mom and I have always had a bit of a rocky relationship. I am not great at boundaries and she railroads people, is always right, and doubles down in every situation.
  I became pregnant with my second child, our first. My mom had separated from my dad and was living in hometown with no family or support. We began talking about her moving to where I was.
  I was excited because she would be closer to her grandchildren (my son and her are VERY close), and she would have someone to call on for help in caring for my brother who is handicapped. She was not letting my dad even know where she lived in hometown, so she had no one. 
   We all agreed that when baby was born, she would watch her while husband and I worked. We pay her and she factors that money into her expenses. 
  My mom has cancer (she is completely non-transparent about her condition) and a heart condition. She gets feels unwell fairly regularly, and it leaves my husband and I in a tight spot. 
   We found a day care that does 5 day care and 2 day care. We enrolled in 5 day care. When I told my mom, she flipped out, begging me not to take my daughter away. My husband and I decided that even though it was going to significantly financially cost us, we would have daughter do 2 days a week at daycare and 3 days at my moms. This way, we had cushion days built in if mom was unwell, and mom had two days a week for doctors, etc. 
  She was NOT pleased with this. She insists that we are punishing her for being ill and destroying her financial security- it comes out to $200 less a mo for her. She even sent me a shot of her w2, insisting she was poor. However, the math in her w2 shows an annual income of 30k from her retirement. This does not take into account her alimony, pay from me, or brothers SS.
   She has been taking to social media to post about people who lack honor, loyalty, etc. about ugly souled people, those who are unwilling to compromise, and who have superiority issues.

AITA for asking my partner to sign a legal contract/directive?,"Throwaway, my family and friends know my main account. I 34(M) have been with my partner (33 F) for almost a decade. We have agreed to not get married, we are both products of really nasty divorces and custody battles. 
We currently live in a small apartment in a large city. With the pandemic, both our jobs have gone fully remote so we don’t need to live in the city anymore. We have decided to move to a small town and buy a house with a big backyard and basically live out our suburban fantasies. We have agreed to each contribute 50% of the down payment amount and to split the mortgage payment 50-50 as well. 

I was talking to my friend who is a real estate lawyer ( he doesn’t really get along with my partner), he mentioned that I should get a legal contract drawn up that will stipulate how to split the equity/mortgage obligations just in case my partner and I break up. He also advised that we include a directive on Who will inherit the property in case either one or both of us die since we are both child free. At first, I thought he was being morbid and overly pessimistic. I did further research and found out that this is standard practice for when unmarried people buy a house together. I brought this up to my partner yesterday and she flipped. She called me an asshole and accused me of planning to break up with her. I tried to explain to her that’s not the case and I just think having a contingency plan is pragmatic.

AITA if I don't help my brother with his academics?,"I'm in college and I have a brother who's in 10th grade. 2020 for the educational sector was rough. Things had to be done remotely or online. The students are only required to comply all requirements so they would be guaranteed promotion to the next year level. Of course, that should be easy. But I had to chase deadlines here and there, I would get little to no sleep just to get through this year.

On the other hand, while I work my butt off on my academics, my mother always asks me to *help my brother do his homeworks*. She always insisted that I had a duty as the older sister to help my younger brother. I didn't like that. I didn't want to do his homeworks since my workload was heavy enough and difficult to deal with. I continued to refuse. 

Christmas break came, I have complied everything, I made sure I had nothing to do left. _I can finally relax._ One day, I found my brother having a live online class in his room. He was worried that his teacher would ask him about his research study (similar to a thesis). He didn't do it. 

""I thought you were gonna do it,"" he told me. 

Well, I did tell him I'd do his research study. But I was under extreme stress with my workload at the time I was supposed to do his research. 

Then he asked me if I could help him with another subject. I told him I could. But I was overwhelmed when I saw how heavy his workload was. It was accumulated since the first day of class until now. Not only from one subject but 5 more subjects. I got more overwhelmed when I learned his research study was given to them when he was in 9th grade.

Am I the asshole? What should I do? The deadline for all of these is on Wednesday (Jan 27). I am very overwhelmed.

EDIT: My mom doesn't ask me to help my brother if she thinks my brother can do it. She only asks me when she sees my brother struggling or slacking.

Some of the activities are similar to what I had gone through when I was in 10th grade.

AITA for wanting my SO to drop one of his friends?,"Sorry if this is unorganized; I am still trying to work through my thoughts on this but would love advice/opinions.

I (22m) have been dating this guy (23) for a few months now, and there’s been this small recurring issue. He has a friend (23m) that he dated for a short while a long time ago, and they still spend time together a lot- possibly as much as if not more than with me. He has admitted to me that this friend still has feelings for him, and does not want us to meet each other because he is afraid it will hurt the friend’s feelings. I trust him completely, but I still feel kind of jealous and frustrated when they spend time together, especially on the couple of occasions when he invites his friend to something and doesn’t invite me (because we cannot meet each other). I have told him in the past how I feel about this friend, but when he asked me if I wanted him to cut ties with this friend, I couldn't bring myself to say yes because of how toxic and childish it sounded.

In his defense, whenever we are hanging out and he gets a call from this friend, he usually ignores it because he knows based on our previous conversations that I feel insecure about this friendship. On the few occasions where he has answered it, he has been quick to say ""I am with y/n right now, can this wait?"" or something similar. 

Another important detail is the fact that we live about an hour away from each other and have to meticulously plan quality time around our busy schedules; meanwhile, this friend lives less than 15 minutes from him so they hang out casually and spontaneously often. This is something I wish our relationship had, so it is possible that I am envious of that instead of jealous over the friendship itself.

I REALLY like this guy, and have been trying really hard to move past it and get over it because I totally trust that nothing is going on behind my back, but I still can’t stop feeling this way whenever I find out they’ve been spending time together. Every time this friend is brought up in conversation it quickly gets awkward until we change the subject (the friend comes up often in conversation because of how often he spends time with and talks to this friend) It should be noted that other than this everything is great. He treats me really well and is good at communicating and making me feel like a valued part of his life. Should I confront him about this again or try harder to get over my feelings?

I didn't want to shake her hand because everyone is understandably paranoid about Covid where I live (New York), but I rose out of my seat and introduced myself. 

She put her stuff down and said that she didn't have my resume and then just sat down and ask me about my previous employment and nothing else. Then she explained that I would be working the front desk but their files were in the back of the store, so I would have to walk back and forth a lot.

I left but was pretty annoyed I drove all the way there for a 2 minute interview with one question.

WIBTA for calling bylaw on my neighbors over parking,"I live in a cul-de-sac and I have new neighbors that moved in and rented out his other floors of his house to other tenants. One of my neighbors have been parking out in the street but the issue is that he has been inconsiderate of his parking. At first he kept parking too close to the ramp of our house which have slightly blocked our entrance and exit. I told him if he could move his car further away from our ramp which he did but now he parks his van at an angle where his back tires point into the court and leaving a huge space away from the curb. While this has not caused any issues directly, this has caused issues for other vehicles that enter our court such as garbage trucks (one time they got pissed and left their bins behind their car) and potentially emergency vehicles. One time when we had a moderate snow fall, the snow plow only shoveled half the court because his van blocked the court so our side wasn't shoveled. 


There are enough space in the court for him to park close to the curb without blocking our ramps or he could park on his driveway but I assume he doesn't to let the other tenant's car leave and enter as their schedules are different. One time one of the tenants have been aggressive to my dad over parking but since his English isn't good so he had just let it go. I have been wondering if I should call bylaw over this but my parents and sister told me that I would be the asshole neighbor for this and create bad blood between us as it isn't currently causing any issues for us as of now.

He recently won 3 of them and I thought that he'd stop but he's planning on betting to get 7 more and sending them to our province, which as of now because of COVID is really expensive. 

I also get money from them for my load for online classes because sometimes our internet acts up, and for months I had 20+ dollars in my account that I didn't use because I didn't think I had to, only for him to borrow all of it and empty it in 3 days. It's annoying, sure, but it's not like I'm the one who puts the money in it. They do.

My mom... I love her very much as well, but for some weird reason I don't like being a dumpster for what she thinks about my dad you know? I agree with what she thinks about how my dad is wasting too much money but I don't like being expected to do something about it, because for one I know it's their own money, they earn it and I don't. (She asks me my opinion, I say I disagree with what he does, she tells me to tell him) She's especially upset because he always says he'll stop doing it but he comes back. Its a weird cycle.

She doesn't have any one else to tell her problems to I guess so I usually keep that in mind but I don't know if I'm just selfish or something for not wanting to hear it anymore. I also think that because of all these recent events my view on my father has changed and I don't like that.

I don't want to limit my parents from the things that make them happy especially since they've worked so hard for these things, and this is one of the main reasons why I do not want to speak up. They didn't exactly have a childhood but they were able to give me one... but I seriously see no point in what my dad is doing because he's not profiting back off the chickens he wins. He's just planning on giving them away. I don't think it's worth the cost, and if I tell him that he's going to guilt trip me and my mom again. I don't like how I'm always the one expected to speak up about things like these when I honestly just want to be left alone.

AITA for not apologizing to my friend?,"Ok hopefully everything I type makes sense.
I have friend (27 F and pregnant), we’ve been friends for forever practically. She’s overly sensitive to many things, so I typically have to watch what I say. Not exaggerating. So about a week ago, we were all in a group chat (5 of us) and one of the girls mentioned how she hopes her baby doesn’t get her overly enthusiastic personality- that it was too much. I didn’t really hear this part as I was doing other things while talking to the group. This topic lasted about 10 seconds before it got changed, but my friend got really upset with this particular comment, very upset. Anyway, a few days ago she sent me a message inviting me to her baby shower. It popped up as a notification, but before I got a chance to reply, she had un send this message. I thought this was weird, so I asked her about it. She said she had messaged about the baby shower but wasn’t sure about the dates so she didn’t want to say anything yet. Then yesterday, she send me a long VERY long message and long message short, she basically told me how she was upset with me because as her best friend, I should have spoken up about that comment that was made about her personality. I would have literally never known she was upset about that. And not with anyone else, but only with me. Then she told me how she had un-sent that message about the baby shower because how mad she was with me. She kept thinking I would message her and apologize for not standing up for her. I apologized and told her that it all happened so fast, and how I thought that comment was weird but didn’t get a chance to say anything because the topic got changed so quickly, and the other girl probably meant it as a joke. Then she replied basically saying she appreciated me apologizing (finally). But now, I’m a bit upset with her. I don’t know why. She basically messaged me telling me to apologize to her for not defending her, when I legit had no idea there was anything to defend. She doesn’t even seem to be mad at the girl that made the comment or anyone else that was there, only me. AITA for not saying anything in the first place? I apologized because typically I would have said something but everything happens to fast. She’s happy now that I’ve apologized, but when she thanked me for finally apologizing, it really made me upset.",Not the A-hole
AITA for snapping at my mom when she had my best interests in mind?,"This is a throwaway account. I've never used Reddit before, but I really needed an outside perspective for this.

I(14F) had an argument with my mom(50F) a few days ago. I had finished a therapy appointment over Zoom at 3:00 that day. My mom is a single mom who usually has to work long hours, so I wasn't expecting her to be home so soon. It was a heavy appointment, and I was sobbing on our kitchen(where I was during the call) floor after it. I cry a lot when I talk about my emotions, so not unusual.

Well, it ended up scaring my mom when she came home early. She asked me if I wanted to talk about it, but I wanted to clear my mind first. She left me alone after I told her that. I went to my room and cried for a few hours. I thought that I would calm down, answer a few of her questions, and that would be it. It wasn't.

While I was in my room, she called my therapist and asked her why I was so upset. My therapist told her how I felt like no one was ever there for me and that I talked about a traumatic incident I went through 4 years ago. For context, my mom was struggling financially after my dad left, and we had to move in with some family friends. We stayed with them for a year, and they were very cruel to us. A different therapist at the time diagnosed me with situational depression that would go away after we moved out. 

When we lived with that family, I told my mom I was depressed. She said some very hurtful things, including threatening to send me to my dad. She was in a stressful situation, struggling with a divorce, money, and her friends of over 20 years betraying her trust. I can't forgive her, but I understand why she lashed out. 

How is this related? Well, after I came out of my room my mom started to say things like ""how dare you say no one cares about you after everything I've done for you,"" and ""don't you understand how much it hurts me to hear that."" I do, it has be hard to hear that as a mother. Here's where I might be the asshole.

I was still upset, so I just started yelling, laying out everything thing she's done to make me feel that way. This included the dad comment, which she did apologize for before this. It was really satisfying in the moment, but I'm sure it wasn't nice for her to hear when she was also struggling. It wasn't the best way for me to handle that. Then she told me that I couldn't ""stay in this emotional pit forever."" I said some things I'm not proud of ex. ""What kind of mother says things like that?""

I know I should move on considering my deepest grievance with her happened four years ago. I can't be angry at her forever. She's been a really supportive mom, so I feel guilty for snapping at her. I know she's right about me holding on to the past, but what she said back then is something that hurt me. I'm also upset that she went behind my back and asked my therapist about our session. It felt like a breach of trust, no matter the intention.

AITA for letting my boyfriend buy an appetizer just for the two of us at my birthday dinner?,"This sounds so trivial but here we go lol

My boyfriend and I met my parents and some family friends at a restaurant for my birthday. The waiter mentioned they’d just gotten in a shipment of a pretty hard to come by seafood, and my boyfriend and I happen to LOVE that dish. I went to order one and my mom, who was paying, said “no I hate fish, please don’t order that...it’s so gross.”

My boyfriend goes “oh, I’ll pick it up, I don’t mind!” And orders one for himself as well. I smiled and thanked him and that seemed to really aggravate my mom. We had dinner and at the end my boyfriend paid for our drinks and the appetizers on a separate tab.

My mom texted me afterward to say she found it really disrespectful and embarrassing that we ordered the food after she said no. She said he “usurped” her gift by outshining her / purchasing the food I asked for.

My boyfriend was surprised and asked if he should apologize, but I said no, because that seems really stupid? Why couldn’t we order something separate that we wanted? I don’t see why it matters that she hates seafood if she wasn’t the one eating it. Also, he paid for it, so what’s the issue? 

My dad called and said he thought we should just smooth things over and say sorry, because apparently mom feels like I hated the birthday dinner and didn’t appreciate it as a gift from her.

WIBTA if I showed my MIL a youtube channel that may be very upsetting to her?,"My MIL is 58 and I consider her family.  She recently got out of her second marriage of 15 years and is newly single.  Also, when she was married she did not work so her career prospects are practically nonexistent.  My wife and worry about her being alone and running out of money, and recently she was admitted to the hospital and, because we are far from her, she has nobody there for her.

We both think she would be better off is she found a partner, but at her age that is not easy and she likely won't have that many chances to find a good one.  She also wants a partner, but the problem is that her expectations are completely unrealistic: she wants a tall, fit guy at least 10 years younger than her who makes six figures.  I want to tell her this isn't going to happen, but my wife has asked that I don't because she doesn't want to upset her MIL.  Normally I would just leave it at that but she is also delusional about her financial prospects in life as well: she thinks that she is going to somehow make it big as an actress even though the only ""productions"" she has been associated with are what would be generously called amateur and she has not made any money after doing this for years; it is essentially a hobby but she thinks it's a career.  She also refuses to do things like be extra in a professional production because she thinks that it is ""beneath her as an actress"".  She currently living entirely off her alimony and has no retirement savings to speak of, meaning if something were to happen to her ex-husband she would be completely destitute.

Lately my wife and I found a YouTuber named Kevin Samuels who specializes in advising women about relationships and tries to get them to have more realistic expectations.  Typically women will call into his show and ask how they can get a wealthy husband and he will tell them what these wealthy men look for in a partner, which typically isn't the women who are calling in.  He usually tells them things that are very difficult for them to hear and many of them get upset.

I kind of want to tell her ""You should check out this YouTuber!"" and send her a link to his channel so she can get her head out of the clouds and have more realistic expectations that might prevent her from passing up a good guy because she's holding out for Mr. Perfect but I also know that it could upset her a lot too.

AITA for letting my flatmate burn himself on the hob?,"Okay so I’m posting this because I’m not a big fan of my housemate as it is and I’m worried I’m being biased.

So, I made some food on the hob (I googled it and I think this is what you Americans call a stove top) but in the process, spilled some of the sauce on one burner and the metal bit. I’ll just apologise now for the fact that I am horrible at describing shit. 

So anyway, I wiped up the excess at carefully as I could without burning the paper towel, then left to eat, with the full intention of coming back after I had finished and the hob was cold to clean it properly. 

Barely a minute later, my flatmate came back in to the kitchen to return his dirty dishes (not even to cook) and saw the dirty hob. He messaged the flat group chat and said “whoever left the hob in this state needs to come clean it now”, to which I responded “try touch it, genius”. Obviously by this I meant “it’s hot, it needs to wait” but then I heard a scream from the kitchen. He had put his whole hand straight down on to it and burned it.

I went to check on it and to help, but he just yelled at me about how I’d done it deliberately and made him hurt himself when I told him to touch it. I tried to stay calm but it basically wound up in me calling him a fucking idiot for touching it despite my sarcasm and him calling me a bitch for not cleaning it and for making him touch it. 

I think we probably both suck, but I have a good amount of “bad blood” with him as it is, so I do feel like I’m probably actually in the wrong here. He seems pretty convinced I am TA, but I think he’s a moron.

"AITA for ""overruling"" my husband's veto and inviting my mom to stay with us for 3 weeks after our baby is born?","I am currently 6 months pregnant with my first baby. My husband and I have been married for 3 years and have a happy marriage overall.

With our baby coming in about 3 and a half months, we're both nervous and excited as any new parents would be. We're reading books, watching Youtube videos, just trying to get an idea of what to do because the most experience we have is holding/playing with babies for about 10 minutes at a time lol and then handing them back to their parents when they cry. 

The part I'm most nervous about is how awful the first month or so is going to be. My doctor says that I am likely to be a scheduled C-section because of some health issues. I can't even begin to imagine how rough it is going to be: recovering from a major surgery, recovering from labor/delivery, sleepless nights with a crying newborn, changing diapers, breastfeeding, pumping, hormones all over the place, etc. all for the very first time. I get awful headaches when I get less than 6 hours of sleep, I can't even imagine how bad it'll be in the first month. 

After the doctor told me that I am likely to be a scheduled C-section, I told my husband we absolutely need outside help at first. My husband was sort of against this idea, he said he would take on the bulk of the work. I know my husband, he's very responsible and follows through on his word but he doesn't know babies! Neither do I! It's not like this is our 3rd kid and we know what we're doing. We don't. 

I called my mom, who lives two hours away, and gave her the general updates. I told her I needed help. For reference, my mom is the nicest person the planet (yes my husband and my mom get along well!) and loves being a mom & grandma. 

She proposed this: ""Yes I can come help out. Here's what I think would be best - you and your husband watch the baby in the daytime. You focus on breastfeeding, pumping, and recovering from surgery. Your husband can focus on keeping the house in order and changing diapers, putting the baby to sleep, etc. And then I'll do the night time duty. I'll slowly switch my sleep schedule so I can be awake at night and hopefully if you're pumping enough I can just feed the baby at night so at least you both will get a full night of sleep.""

This was heaven-sent to me. I told her I needed to talk to husband but ""99% yes and ohmygodthankyousomuchIloveyouMom"".

Fast forward to today. It's been a week of back and forth on this. We've had rational discussions, we've yelled, we've tried everything but neither will budge. My husband insists that having a third adult is ""suffocating"" and ""trust me, I'll take care of the baby for everything besides breastfeeding that's all you gotta do"". But I feel like he's being really naive and I'll have to deal with the fallout.

So yesterday I said fuck it and told my mom yes. Obviously this led to a fight with my husband, who is upset because he clearly said no but I went through with it anyways.",Asshole

I mostly do this so my kids can actually have some memories playing with the dog before he gets older and can't play that well. I don't think they'd otherwise play with him. They seem to enjoy it once they start so it doesn't seem like a big deal.

AITA for not telling my ILs the whole story about my family?,"I (24f) met my husband in college. We got married two years into our relationship. I met his parents the first Christmas we spent together and I have a pretty good relationship I would say. They asked me that first year about my family and I told them I didn't have one. This is kind of true but not technically. 

You see I was the product of an affair my father had. My mother was an addict and OD'd soon after I was born. My father and his wife took me in but I was treated as less than by everyone in the family. It didn't help that I was born into the middle of their family. I have four older half siblings and three younger half siblings. None of them wanted me in their lives because they were all told I was the product of an affair. My father was forgiven though. His wife made sure the kids didn't blame him, just me. My grandparents didn't want to lose my father and their other grandkids so they kept quiet and her family never had any reason to accept me. I was kicked out before my 18th birthday and was kinda alone. A friends family took me in and they're the reason I didn't go to college.

But I don't have family.

I never told my IL's this and they assumed all my family had passed away. I never corrected them or gave any kind of truth to them. Until they found out it wasn't quite true after a childhood friend made a post about my ""family"" on FB and my husbands family saw it. They asked what that was about and were hurt I wouldn't at least be a bit more clear that the people were still alive and just not good. I said I found it easier not to talk about it.

My husbands sister is the most angry because she claims I lied to them and anyone who claims they don't have family is claiming they lost them. My husband told her and the rest of his family that I didn't owe them my story.

AITA For Not Flushing?,"Throwaway because the missus uses Reddit. 

My wife and I both care about the environment a lot. So much so that when we found out about how much water we were wasting (we live in a state where water supply is a problem) we decided we had to to something. We started with simply changing our habits, and have since purchased smart sinks that help reduce water waste. We then put in one of the Eco toilets in our main bathroom that has 2 flush buttons, one for pees, and another for poos. 

I feel like we’ve done a lot of what we can, but I still feel terrible like I’m wasting water that other people need. I try to limit how much water I drink and think of creative new ideas to save every drop possible. I have noticed that our Eco toilet still seems to use a lot of water when you push the pee button.. so I began not flushing for number ones. This had irritated my wife, but to her credit she did come around and often also doesn’t flush on number ones. Well, when my wife is gone, if I have a light defecation, I will often wait until peeing one more time before I flush the toilet. I realize this is somewhat abnormal, but it’s not like I pee all that often because I’ve successfully cut down my water intake by a lot.

 The problem is that my wife and I are almost always home now (working remote) and I haven’t been able to hide this habit anymore. Additionally I tried my best to explain to her and ask if she would be willing to do her part for the environment too. She is horrified and says I’m, “trying way too hard.” It’s not like I’m asking guests to not flush their poops, I’m asking my wife. And after one additional pee I think it’s okay to flush.. because obviously hygiene and smell does come into play.

AITA for refusing to take care of my niece?,"I'm new to reddit, i just came here for your opinions & English is not my native so please forgive me for any mistakes.

My(22F) sister(28F) gave birth to a healthy and beautiful baby girl amidst lockdown. Due to restrictions in transport and BIL being in essential services, it was decided that sis and my niece would live with me & my mother. It was okay with everyone since the baby and sister's health was our first priority. Schools were closed & my mom is a teacher so she would be home all the time to help take care of my niece. I was in my final year undergrad having online classes so i would help in some things too like mostly in cooking & tidying up.

When they were moving back to BIL's house sis asked me to come with them to help her till my niece gets adjusted there but i have my job training coming up in a month, its virtual but they have told me to learn some things to get me ready for the actual training & i needed to focus on it. 
So i refused at first but sis convinced me to go with her since she was going back to her job (only works for 5 hrs a day) also bcoz her MIL is not a very caring person, she treats people... idk how to say differently? If they are not useful? Like MIL refused to cook when sis was almost due just bcoz my sis was told to take rest as she had severe morning sickness throughout her pregnancy. 

I did end up going with them and honestly i couldn't stay a week there. The MIL would look at me like I'm leeching off of her and make me do things like all the dishes and laundry too. She did not hold my niece when my sis wasn't around. while i was there MIL always interrupted while i was studying. Like telling that my niece was making a fuss  or to change her diapers.

My niece is not a trouble maker as long as she has her tummy full she doesn't cry but she sleeps less during the day. MIL has severe OCD when i was sitting on the couch she found some hair on it and it looked like mine(short) so she grumbled something along the lines that this is what happens when she lets strays live in her house.....and that's it, i lost it, I didn't argue with her i just told what i heard to my sis and that i will be leaving. Sis told me to ignore and to stay a while longer for my niece's sake. I said i had enough and it would hurt my self respect if i stayed any longer and i left a day after. 

After 3 days sis called my mom to tell how her MIL wasn't feeding my niece well when she went to work or how she wouldn't change her diapers making my niece have rashes and how she would deliberately make her cry to make my sister take care of her and many more. She was angry that i wasn't helping her. It broke my heart, my niece didn't deserve any of this!! now I'm starting to regret my choice. Mom is on my side that i did the right thing and that i should focus on my career.

So, am i the asshole here? Is there something i should have done differently?

AITA for witholding his phone and making my husband shit his pants?,"Me and my husband (F&M26) both have access to each others phones for cases of emergency or convenience. Never been an issue of trust so this is really not about that. 


UPDATE/EDIT

- to address some suggestions. Playing the tv is not a good option because the whole point is to watch it together. I still feel bad at him being inconsiderate
- all of our relationship issues are not solved by play fighting and sharting ourselves
- i wouldnt not be able to physically block him from his property. I am 5'2 and about 130 pounds. He is 6'2 and a muscular 280 pounds upwards. It was all in good fun


Update
- he's basically over it this morning. He felt embarrassed and felt even more embarrassed that he found it so funny, so he decided to give me the silent treatment. Before anyone talks about stonewalling or this being abuse or whatever else reddit like to scream about, just don't. The whole thing really isn't that serious. 
-as many suspected, it was in fact a shart. 
- i can't read all of the comments. But he did find this post and is reading me YTA judgments only
-we had a serious talk and have agreed to ban phones in the bathroom, me included. He said he wanted to play fight with me and that he does find it funny but the shart caught him off guard this time. 
-we had a less serious talk and decided that if he takes longer than 8 minutes he has to wear a dog cone with ""i sharted"" written on it to answer the door to whatever poor delivery person is next in line. 



Ok: original post


Often when we are watching tv together, one of us will need to take a bathroom break. This is fine, we just pause it. My issue is that when he goes, he takes his phone (as I do, keep your hygiene comments to yourself)and will blast youtube for 30 mins and upwards. We have a small home, I hear everything. Sometimes he will only pee, watch youtube, and then come out after. Sometimes he will poop, watch youtube, and then come out after. I have never heard him do his business at the end of these massive periods of time which indicates to me that he has no issues going. He is also very quick in there if he his going between playing his video games. I'm talking 3-4 mins for a dump MAXIMUM. Might be irrelevant, but I usually take 5 mins or under. 

I might sound crazy knowing so much about his bowel movements but trust me this issue has been driving me INSANE for such a long time. I've asked countless times what has taken so long, we joke about it a lot and it is fairly light hearted but it does actually bother me. I don't care what he does in there but I find it so annoying when he makes me wait on him. I've been joking around that I want him to leave his phone outside the bathroom so that he will be quicker. Every time he refused. I've asked if he would rather just go and have alone time and leave me to watch tv in peace but he insists he wants to watch it with me and wants me to pause. He promises every time that he will be quick. He never has been. 

Anyway, it came to a bit of a head tonight. His phone was by me as it was charging and we were watching a show we were both super into. He went to go to the bathroom and I started with the jokes about not taking his phone and being quick. I sat on his phone and he got very annoyed, but still laughing"" saying that he was desperate and didn't have time to play around. I just kept saying ""go then"". This did not go on for very long. He shit his pants, screamed in anger, and went upstairs (without his phone, lol. Yes it was a quicker bathroom trip cleaning that up than his usual trips.)

I do feel bad but whatever, I'll buy him some new pants. I feel like it's his fault for not just going to the toilet when he needed it. His phone is not essential in shitting and he goes without it when his friends are waiting on him. He hasn't spoken to me for a couple of hours and blames me for embarrassing him. I feel like he should be more embarrassed of how inconsiderate he is rather than the shitcident. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to commit to clearing my calendar for a month so my in-laws can visit?,"My husband an I got married in October 2019. My in-laws have been some degree of a problem from day one. My husband is an only child and really did nothing to help manage the relationship. 

When we started dating they basically encouraged my husband to leave me because he was going to grad school. They we never better than cordial. Then when I moved to be with him they would come visit uninvited, or demand we go see them almost to every weekend my husband was home, and he was traveling a lot. We rarely got time together between school and his family. Just by way of one example, MIL got upset because we went to see my family, for the first time that year, over mother's day and the card on the flowers sent to her was from both of us (I arranged and paid for the damn things). 

After we got married we couldn't take a honeymoon because his dad had surgery two weeks later, and for some reason need my husband there for the full time. So we had 0 time together even after our wedding. They also made the planning really hard. MIL was a pain about everything, and even cried over trivial things like how we addressed the invitations. (One example of many many. She didn't understand it was not hey day). We were slated to take our honeymoon in May 2020 which obviously didn't happen. That was more important to me than our actual wedding (I wanted to elope in the first place). We tried to take a covid one close to home but that failed miserably.

Now neither of us have seen our families or traveled in a year. We live 3,000 miles away. MIL and FIL want to come out for the month of may and rent a house (we don't have enough room for them - small apartment on expensive city). I am fine with this in principal (although worried about it admittedly), but my husband and I had agreed that the second we were vaccinated we were taking our honeymoon. I am fine to put up with them being around for that long, but I am not ok with putting off our honeymoon any longer, which I've made clear and he agreed to. Now the parents are pressuring us to commit to staying put and I think we will likely be able to travel by then. If we can't I'm fine with it, but if we can I don't want to delay it because his parents need to be out here for a full freaking month. AITA here?

I think I shouted ""what?!"". It was about 60% full. I then realised I was technically standing at the wrong bus stop - I was 12 feet away from where I should have stood. My next bus was in 45 minutes.

I sprinted after the bus at full speed for about 3 minutes. It stopped at the next bus stop to let someone on and I got to it just as the doors were closing. 

I assumed the bus driver didn't see me running after it. But a few people were snickering at me and giving wry smiles when I got on suggesting they noticed me shout after the bus and run after it.

My longish hair was likely a huge mess and I was panting and out of breath. I paid the bus driver without really saying anything. Then he said ""What is it you think you have that I dont?""

I was so confused and annoyed by this question. To this day it doesnt make sense to me that he said that. It came out of nowhere and suddenly made a small business transaction to be somehow personal and negative. 

 But I replied with something that I feel guilty about to this day (this all happened a few years ago). I said ""GCSEs, probably"" while walking away from him. (Meaning I had not failed school, GCSEs are a test in the UK, and saying you have GCSEs means you have at least passed the GCSE exams).

I actually started flushing in the face as I went to sit down and some people were laughing at me. I expected the bus driver to order me to get off the bus and was planning on what to say or do next as I had really escalated things. It was a seriously low blow and does not represent how I normally think or see bus drivers. He didn't respond or do anything and I stayed on until I got to my stop.

I want to know just how much of an asshole move this was, given the context, frustration, that I had already been humiliated a bit, my immediate regret and shame. Never really told anyone before.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I spoke to my higher up about the rude actions of her higher up?,"I'm an assistant manager in training at my job in food retail. I'm able to handle stress and such very well and normally just shake it off and move on. However today something happened that I've never had happen in my decade in this field and it floored me a bit.

My job runs events at holidays. They are promoting an upcoming event, however we do not yet have the order forms for it as of yet and wont likely get them in until next week. A person called and wanted to order. In the past for events, before the forms came in, we politely told them we could not take the order, and to please call back at ""x"" date. So that's what I did. 

Well, one of the assistant managers (the one that answered the phone) comes storming up to me to get the phone back and demands to know if I took the order. I told her no because we did not had the order forms and I was taught not to take the orders without the proper form. 

This woman went *off* on me. I mean, in front of my staff and customers. And I dont mean simply telling what she perceived as wrong, but talking down to me as if I were stupid for *doing what I had been trained to do*. She outright and openly humiliated me in front of staff, my staff, and customers. Complete with a huge sigh, eye roll, and ""yea, great job you did there. What the hell were you thinking? How hard is it to write down someones information? It's literally just a name and a number and what they want. I didnt think that would be so difficult for you."" Cue another sigh and eye roll. When I tried to explain I meant no harm and it was what I had been told to do, she cut me off midsentence and says ""Right, whatever. My fault for expecting competence."" And stalked off. 

I could only stand there floored with people staring at me feeling like a complete idiot and about 2 inches tall. For an honest miss communication due to my recieved training. One of my employees came over and asked me if I wanted to go take a break or something because I must have looked horribly embarrassed and upset. I said I was fine, and went about my regular day, But that whole event has stayed under my skin all day.

I should point out, I've *never* gotten this kind of attitude from her before. Shes normally rather civil (I wouldnt call her ""nice"" per say, shes a bit rough around the edges).

My boss didnt work today, but I was wondering if I would be the asshole if I brought up the encounter to her when I see her next. If i were to pull her aside and apologize for the error in judgement and miss communication but explain how badly I had been treated and how I didnt appricate being spoken to in such a rude and degragtory manner. She gets along well with this manager, and maybe she could speak to her about how she handles these things before she does it to another employee that goes to HR about it? I'm not even expecting or asking for an apology, but just to be heard and understood that that way of talking to your employees is unacceptable.

AITA For adopting my sister's former dog when he got put up for adoption?,"Obligatory mobile/native English

I'm kinda wracking my brain on this one, and I could use some help. For context my sister (22 F) has been struggling with mental health issues for several years and has a drug abuse problem. She recently started doing harder drugs and things spiraled out of control. She is short tempered, a flight risk (has taken off on foot at odd hours of the night with no warning), is verbally abusive... Not the best kind of person to be around right now. She recently had two inpatient experiences where my family thought she was getting the help she needed but she relapsed a few weeks ago.

My sister owned a dog for 2 years. I have had the pleasure of watching him over the course of that time, and I even attempted to train him. He's a great dog and deserves someone who is going to give him a good home. Recently, my sister and her crappy ex boyfriend broke up, leaving her homeless. Instead of contacting someone in the family, she asked a friend of a friend to watch the dog. After she finally reaches out to me and I accept, the dog gets loose in a neighborhood. After 1 day of searching my sister gives up. I continue to day 10 and lose contact with my sister (she would rarely pick up the phone or reply to messages). Day ten rolls around, and at this point my sister fully gives up. I get her on the phone and she tells me that ""if you can take care of him, you can have him"". I do one last search and figure out he's at our city's humane society, already ready to be adopted. I keep texting her and calling her, trying to convince her to get the dog. But no response.

I adopted him and as I'm leaving, I made a tiktok of me getting him back after being missing for 10 days.  The video has blown up and has pretty much gone viral. Everyone is happy that the dog is safe and happy. 

Everyone except my sister. 

After seeing the video, she believes she still owns the dog after she gave up searching for him and put the responsibility of his care on me. The dog was already put up for adoption, and I don't believe he would be safe with her. 

So, reddit, am I the asshole for adopting the dog?

Edit: thank you everyone for reading and giving me advice. I think getting him chipped would be the right move. I really hope my sister gets the help she needs but as of right now, I've gone no contact. For all the love a good advice, here is the required dog tax.

AITA for being affectionate to my step father,I (17F) am very close with my step father(46M) my step dad has been around since I was 3 and is the only real father I’ve ever had. A few weeks ago at a family gathering there weren’t any open chairs so I went at sat on my step fathers lap. After the party I had multiple family members tell me that it was creepy that I sit on my step fathers lap and that it’s inappropriate. I don’t feel it’s inappropriate or creepy it’s not sexual he’s my father and I don’t see why it’s wrong. I told them this and they told me it’s creepy because he’s my step father and that it wouldn’t be weird to do that with my real dad if he was around. I told them at as far as I’m concerned he is my real dad and that sitting on his lap is part of how I show my affection and I left. So Reddit AITA?,Not the A-hole
AITA for hiding my sons AirPods?,"Overly simplified title and on mobile.

Last year I bought my son AirPods because he passed his classes and survived online school even though most of his grades dropped to failing. He’s prone to losing things and accident prone.

Recently he’s been doing things, putting his AirPods somewhere, and forgets where he put them. So I’ve been hiding them. When he puts his AirPods on the couch and comes back an hour later wondering where they are I put them behind the mini chalkboard stand on the counter in the kitchen.

My spouse hates this and says that I’m torturing and punishing him for being forgetful but it’s starting to get annoying when he yells “Has anyone seen my AirPods?” And then hearing “Got ‘em” a few hours later as his voice rings through the house.

AITA for using a blender cup I didn’t ask permission for?,"I feel like i’m going to burst! 

My sister got mad at me for using her blender cup. I didn’t ask permission, but since she wasn’t using it and I was gonna clean it right after, I figured it’s fine. I used it to make a whey protein shake. That’s literally it. I drank from it by unscrewing the lid and using that as a cup. 

She freaked out on me. Saying it was unhygienic. When: 
- she uses my earbuds because she needs it for class.
- She takes my used lip glosses and lip sticks because she likes them (I even go to her room now to use them because I know she uses it more.) 
- She eats from the same plates, using the same cutlery, while drinking from the same glasses our family uses communally. 

I told her if she really cared about hygiene, then why did she care about a cup that can be washed when my lip glosses and makeup literally have my dead skin and germs in it. You can’t sanitize a gloss the way you do cups. 

I felt like I was gonna burst. It feels like she used a random excuse to make me think I was in the wrong. She said remember x time when I didn’t lend her y thing. I proceeded to point at everything in her room that was mine, to give a counterpoint that I don’t withhold things she needs.
- My pricey Japanese pens I lent her for her online classes
- My foundations, lip sticks, eyelash glue, and other makeup she steals from my room
- The laptop stand she borrowed not even 1 night ago I gave within seconds
- The earbuds she’s been using since the pandemic classes started (mine! She didn’t even ask permission for these, I figured, she’d need them a lot, it’ll be hers for the time being). 

But I hope that reading from this I was able to portray our dynamic: we literally borrow things from each other. Being the older sibling, I notice my things go missing—and I just assume it’s okay because it’s with her. Jesus Christ am I the asshole here? Am I just so fucking dense?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my sister that I dont want her mettress even though its free.,"So some context, I (22m) just moved into a new apartment for a new job with literally nothing. No car or furniture and I am fresh out of college. I have been slowly acquiring furniture and just very recently bought a well priced car. I have been sleeping on a half deflated air mattress for 2 months now. 

My sister (24f) well call A is getting a new mattress from her dad for basically free and is getting rid of the old one. She currently has a queen sized soft mattress. A offers me the mattress and I say when I have a chance Ill go look at it but a queen sized mattress may be too big for my room and Im really looking for a full or twin xl. My room's pretty small. Eventually I make it to her house and lie down in it and I decide I dont like it. Its too soft. I finally am no longer using a hand me down ultra plush mattress like I have my whole childhood and I dont wanna get into that headache really. My back is thanking me. I tell A im not really interested and she says why not its free just take it and get rid of it if you dont like it. I say if I dont like it I dont want to go through the headache of getting rid of it much like youre dealing with right now. And I tell her if I sleep better on a half deflated air mattress than this bed I dont want it.

We go on about it at eachother for a little while longer and over the next week I talk to my mom and other sister who also are puzzled why I dont want it and are urging me to take it. I just tell them what I told A. I would just rather wait till I can afford a bed that I like. A isnt really mad anymore she just wouldnt let it go for about a month and I had to eventually be very blunt with her.

AITA? This kinda seems like a petty thing I guess which is why im not sure if I was just being an a-hole.

Side note: the reason I dont just repump the air mattress is that it deflates until it stops about half full so I just gave up fighting it and leave it there.",Not the A-hole
AITA for expecting my fiancée to modify her plans for me?,"We live three hours apart right now because she's going to school there and I work full time here. I work 8am to 5pm every week day. She told me there is an event she wants to go to Saturday, and she wants to leave early Saturday morning. She told me that if I wanted to go with them (her and her kids) that I am more than welcome, but I would have to leave Friday afternoon and spend the night so that I can be there early enough for when she wants to leave on Saturday morning. 

It's a three hour drive. I work until 5pm. I would want to get a decent nights sleep and leave early Saturday morning around 6am or something, but that puts me at her place around 9am and that's too late in the day for her. The event is 2 hours from where she is. So yes, we would be getting there around mid-day, but I would get to sleep a bit before driving that far. 

I know you're thinking ""just leave earlier"" but she won't accept me leaving at 3am to be there for 6am because then she claims I'll complain of being tired the entire time we're at the event. So she won't accept that as a possible solution to the issue either. She says ""I don't know what the big deal is. If you can make it Friday afternoon that's great and I'd love for you to be there but if you can't make it then it's okay. We'll just see each other another time"". 

Now if I were to plan an event, and I wanted her to attend, I would make sure that I adjusted my plans to accommodate her drive-time and energy levels. But she speaks in absolutes and tells me that every single time she plans something, I always have a problem with the time to be there. And it's always because of the drive that I'd have to make, and it's always because I'd have to leave after work. I expect her to accommodate my drive-time and energy-levels when she thinks up an event to go to with her kids, just like I'd do for her. Does that make me the asshole?

Should I just cash in a PTO day Friday and drive out Friday?

AITA for telling my boyfriend not to show my family a movie we both like because it's racist?,"I'm 19F half-Japanese and white, and my boyfriend is 20M Black.

We're big movie buffs and I love mid-century films. A personal favourite of both of ours is Breakfast at Tiffany's. There's a pretty racist Asian character in it that's not funny at all if you're not racist, basically, that would ruin the movie if I didn't love Audrey Hepburn in it so much. We honestly just fast-forward the scenes when we watch it, but there are a few where you can't.

He was talking with my parents about movies, and apparently neither had watched it before. He told them that it was a classic, and next time he comes over, we should all watch it together.

Later, I told him my dad wouldn't be able to see it from an ""it was another time"" lens since he experienced so much racism as a first generation Japanese immigrant. My boyfriend told me he's watched a few movies with racist Black characters, but I told him everyone is different. He called me an ""SJW"" and said my dad is cool and would be fine with it, and that I'm acting like he's never experienced racism before. That's not how I feel at all. He says that it's stupid for me to think that I can shield my dad from all the racism in the world, and it's insulting to him to pretend like it doesn't exist around him. He also said that I'm a hypocrite and if I think the movie is so racist, I shouldn't be watching it either.

Am I treating my dad like a baby? I don't know. I just don't think he wants to see anti-Asian racism in our own home. Also, am I perpetuating racism by watching a movie with racist scenes? AITA?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA If I sell my PS5 to my little brother?,"3 weeks ago I finally got my PS5 that I ordered of StockX for 900$. I was happy but not excited cause my Dad accidentally bought me the PS5 instead of the Xbox, while giving it to me he told me I could keep it or sell it and keep all of the money, I decided that I would play both Spiderman games and then sell it to my little Brother. After 2 weeks I finally decided to sell it for 600$ and my brother was Happy but the next day his Dad (we have different fathers) said that he couldn't cause my mom wouldn't have approved it. I decided to tell my mom to see if he was right. So I tell my mom I'm selling the PS5 and she goes off screaming and telling me ""YOU AREN'T SELLING SH*T"" and ""YA DAD BOUGHT THAT SYSTEM AS A GIFT"" and that I would be an asshole if I sell it. I tell her that yes I am and that it's my system and My Dad said I could. After a bit of arguing she says fuck it and tells me I'm an asshole and to ""do whatever tf u want idc anymore."" After that nonsense I just tell my Bro to call his dad to tell him to send the money and he tells me that he doesn't want to anymore because mom would be mad. I tell him It doesn't matter if she is and he just walks to his room. Some people in the house are telling I would be an asshole if I did sell it and that I should keep it cause it's a gift.

AITA - For asking / telling her to pee before bed ?,"AITA - my girlfriend will always wake up around 1 or 2am and have to pee like a racehorse. She drinks a ton of fluids before beds , chamomile teas, water, fruits ect. She will also never pee before she goes to sleep. 

Our bathroom in our studio is a very close earshot when trying to sleep. This is strange to say but she pees loud !! And it wakes me up. She wakes up practically every night bursting to pee and I get woken up by her how loud she pees. I have a hard time falling back asleep after being woken up.... 

I talked to her about it and asked if she could try peeing before bed so we both get better sleep. She got mad saying she can pee when she wants and it’s not a big deal.....

AITA for being upset my friend is associating with someone who is actively hurting me?,"Tldr at the bottom and apologies for any formatting issues and alike. I'm new to reddit and am typing this while at break during work so kinda rushing. Names have been changed for the sake of privacy.

So my abuser (who'll we'll call D) has been at my throat for close to 3 years now and has not relented. We met through meme accounts on Twitter and I genuinely thoughts of him as a friend at first but it's clear he was manipulative and abusive. The exacts of his abuse are deserving of its own post so I'll keep it short and sweet at this: he ruined me mentally.

Now onto my friend (we'll call her P). About a month ago I broke down in a VC with P and when she asked what was wrong, I told her what was going on between me and D since I was under the impression she didn't know who D was (this'll be important). I tell her he's been stalking me and using dummy accounts to get around blocks and even progressed to sending me graphic gore images (I have suffered a very traumatic experience in the past and it's very triggering for me). I am not making this up: she says verbatim ""oh D is a pretty chill guy. He's just joking"". I immediately ask P if she's joking but she assures me she's serious. I end the vc and the next day P sends me a DM asking why I bailed and I said I felt hurt she'd associate with someone who would treat me so badly. I had even presented proof and linked to the respective acts of aggression towards me but P insisted I was overreacting. At this point I'm getting frustrated and ask if they can at the very least talk to D and ask them to leave me alone. P says D isn't that close and isn't likely to listen. I rebut by saying if they're not close, she should have no problem cutting ties and P flat out says she can't do that to her best friend and that she's known him too long. Not an ounce of self awareness. 

It's a back and forth until P starts getting annoyed and says I need to get over it before blocking me. Fast forward to a few days later and P unblocks me only to message me saying she's ready for me to apologise. Out of curiosity I see what P was posting while I was gone and almost all of it was hate posts directed at me saying stuff like ""X tried to control me!!!"" And ""X is such a pussy!!!"" Etc. I leave them on read and as of now, my phone has been blowing up with P saying I'm too sensitive and need to grow a spine. Apologies if this seems all over the place, I had to condense a lot of it and I'm busy at work.

She just ignored me. This month she crashed her car and said she wouldn’t be able to pay me back this month like she planned to. Then it turned out her bf was able to get it fixed for a good deal and she told me she’ll “definitely be able to pay me back sooner than she thought.” Apparently no sooner than being willing spend her money on products no one is going to want to from her. I want to explain to her how insulting it is that she’d invite me to an MLM party she’s hosting while she owes me money because I don’t think she understands. These Starter Kits for these companies are expensive. But I also don’t want to start a fight or lose her as a friend. She has 2 kids and lives in her bf’s house and has not had a job for 2 months.

AITA for spending my ex’s money?,"AITA for spending my Ex’s money

I(22F) have been dating my current bf for a few months. He’s 23 and on his way to medical school in the fall. He’s working in a lower level lab job currently and makes around 3500 a month. I make a little over 2500 as I’m still in college. I have my own apartment and he financially supports me through either cash deposits through zelle or paying for groceries/car expenses. He spends around 500 a month on me to help out with college/ living expenses. As February rent approaches he explained to me he couldn’t help out this month as he had to give his brother money. I said okay no biggie. I have money saved for slow months at work to cover the gap. Last week, I was on the phone with a friend and she had me on speaker. She asked what I was doing and I said I’m doing my budget for the week as I had to readjust it to accommodate the money out of my savings and how I plan to save more next month to make up for it. My ex and friend are also friends and he overheard. I got a zelle from my ex for 500 that same night. I called and asked what it was for and he explained he overheard the conversation between my friend and I and wanted to help. I thanked him and thought nothing else of it. Yesterday, my current bf said that he had extra money because he worked overtime and asked me if I still needed the 500 and I said no. He insisted on sending it as he didn’t want me to dig into my savings. I insisted I didn’t need it and told him why. He got upset with me and told me I embarrassed him. I told him that I wasn’t badmouthing him and just mentioned him not sending the money in passing, not as a full topic of conversation. He wants me to block my ex, send the money back and to apologize. I told him that we can discuss blocking my ex but I have nothing to apologize for. He called me an asshole. AITA here?

Edit: Ex is SUPER well off. He’s made some good investments and comes from family wealth as well so 500 isn’t a huge amount to him.

Edit: my boyfriend isn’t a sugar daddy. Go to the sugar daddy sub to understand how those relationships work. We do not have an arrangement. I did not request these funds nor would I break up with him if he stopped providing them. Just because it isn’t your experience doesn’t mean it’s wrong or doesn’t happen. Many men financially support girlfriends in my community. Stop being close minded, you can downvote me all you want but it doesn’t change reality which is that many men still do give their gfs money BECAUSE THEY CAN AND WANT TO.

Edit: I don’t accept the asshole verdict because most of you barely commented on the situation with the ex but commented on the fact they give me money at all. I didn’t know Reddit was full of insanely shallow men",Asshole
AITA for refusing to download Life360 even though my mom wants me to?,"EDIT: Thank you for the silver, everyone! Wow, was not expecting this post to blow up. 

For background: Life360 is an app that tracks your location. I’m 26, financially independent, living with my long term partner, and have a full time job. When I first moved out (at 19) my mom was constantly asking me where I was. I got annoyed about this, so I just showed her the app, and downloaded it, to comfort her. 

My mom would constantly watch me on her phone and label places I was at (I got the notification sometimes no more than 15 minutes after arriving that she had done so). My mom is also historically very disrespectful of any of my attempts to have boundaries, and be an independent adult.

Back in November I deleted the app off of my phone because I decided it was time. She noticed after a while, and sent a code to me to rejoin, saying she would love if I could rejoin the app. I didn’t rejoin, and just ignored the text, continuing the conversation about something else. So, the next week, she did the same thing. I texted back and told her simply that I decided not to redownload the app, but thank you anyway. 

She then sent me a long text that said “you’re welcome but I just feel like crying right now” and then continued on about how it would’ve meant so much to her if I had just accepted, and how the little things just make her happy. I told her if she needs to know where I am, she can just ask me, and that it’s just an app. She then said it’s not really about the app, and that she wished things could go back to the way they used to be. This is a fight we’ve had many times (she wishes I would be younger and living at home still), so I told her I am not repeating myself about it again. She then sent me “I’m not asking you to repeat yourself. Just expressing my thoughts.” I didn’t respond, so she sent a follow up of “your response to me drastically changed my feelings at this moment so thank you. I am not at all sad anymore.”

I know it sounds like I was being harsh, but my mom has a history of being overbearing, emotionally hysterical, and controlling. I feel like I am an adult and I don’t need to explain myself to her. Having an app that can track your location constantly makes no sense, and only gives her a feeling of control over me. We also live 3 1/2 hours away, so if I was in any danger, she wouldn’t be able to do anything anyway.

AITA for not stopping or calling the cops for a wrecked jeep?,"So about 2 weeks ago I was DD for my wife. Her sister was having a birthday party at a bar and she wanted to go. I also had the after hours phone for my job so I couldn't drink anyway, so I volunteered to DD.

We were planning to leave around 12 or so but I got a call and had to run to work. The bar didn't close till 4 and my wife was off the next day. She knew going in that this was a possibility so she didn't mind staying at the bar while I did the after hours.

Anyway, after I got back out of work and got back to scoop her up it was every bit of 0230 and I was quite tired. Had some coffee at work but was still dragging a bit. On the way home I came across a jeep in the middle of the 2 lanes on an off ramp. It looked like the front end was smashed a bit and it was facing the wrong way. Clearly an accident not just it died.

"AITA for buying clothes, makeup, and jewelry that my sisters like but can’t afford?","So my sisters (E 18 and L 13) and I (F16) went shopping yesterday. It’s important to note that I work at least 20 hours a week as a babysitter and I make at least $400 a week. My older sister tutors an hour a week and makes $30 a week, and my little sister occasionally does chores for extra money but usually relies on her birthday and Christmas money. I sometimes offer her a babysitting job if I’m booked for that day but she doesn’t really have much of a source of income. 

We went to Sephora because I wanted some new foundation and concealer and I bought them and some new mascara and eyeshadow. My sisters didn’t get anything. We went to Francesca’s and I browsed the store and bought a skirt that I really liked and 2 pairs of earrings. My little sister wanted to go to Pandora after to look at the rings and see what she wanted for her birthday coming up. I ended up buying the sparkling snowflake earrings and the Cinderella’s coach earrings (I don’t usually spend this much money but I haven’t been shopping in months and worked almost triple hours over winter break so I felt like I deserved it). We went to lush and I bought each of my sisters a bath bomb and bought 2 for myself and we went home and in the car my older sister started yelling at me for being able to afford nicer things than her and that it’s not fair that I got 2 pairs of Pandora earrings, Francesca’s earrings, a skirt, bath bombs, and new makeup and that all she got was 2 shirts from the clearance rack, a “cheap” pair of boots ($60) and the bath bomb I got her. She said she really liked the clothes and makeup and jewelry that I bought but she couldn’t afford it so I shouldn’t buy it either.

I don’t think I’m in the wrong but she’s really mad at me and is refusing to talk to me.

Edit: I think another reason my sister is mad at me is because I got my license on my 16th birthday and my grandpa bought himself a new car a week before so as a birthday present he gave me his old car (2013/2014 Toyota Prius worth around $12,000) and my sister is mad that it didn’t go to her even though she doesn’t have her license yet",Not the A-hole
AITA for trying to meet up with a boy and not telling my friend about it,"So me(18F) and my best friend(18F) have been friends for 10 years. Truth be told, she’s literally my only friend bc I cant seem to make other friends. She tells me everything about every boy she gets with. I think its been a little less than 10 guys. We are complete opposites when it comes to that. For some context I’ve never even shown interest in a boy or vice-versa, or even kissed a boy, but I have been talking to one particular guy (17M) in my class for a few weeks. He asked me to hang out and at first I thought he was joking bc literally no boy has ever asked me to, but it turns out he was serious about it.

Now the problem is that this guy is really good friends with my best friend too.  In fact, she had told him to get with me and was telling me to get with him, so I sincerely thought she would be happy. But he had already told her that we were making plans to see each other just as I was texting her to ask if I should see him.

She texts me that I have been ignoring her to text the guy (which I hadn’t, we were literally making plans so see each other the next day and were talking abt her buying something off insta when she said this). Now, I dont know if shes mad that I’m meeting with him sometime this week or that I told her too late, I’m just so confused.

Now she has refused to answer my calls, is barely responding to my texts, has canceled all our plans. Im at a loss. I’ve already apologized for not telling her sooner, but I was scared she would judge me. I’m so worried that I feel like throwing up and crying. Idk what’s wrong with me I feel so bad. So AITA for not telling her? What are some ways I can rectify the situation?",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting to put a profile picture with my bf?,"So firstly I'm 20 years old and gay. My mother, father and brother know about my sexual orientation.
To way they found out about me is a complete story that really doesn't matter here.
Well anyway, to get to the point, the only person who really accepts me is my brother, my mother tries and all, she does her best and I understand.
With my father it's different, i barely have talked with him since he found out, and I think he tries to avoid me.
Well the part where I need your opinion is relative to today, i changed my picture in WhatsApp to one with my boyfriend, nothing explicit just laying on his shoulder.
Later my father called my mom and told her if I could be more discrete about my relationship and maybe change the photo to something else.
So guys, I don't know if I am being kinda of an asshole for wanting to show the world truly who I am, or I am maybe hurting my father feelings and moving too fast...

AITA for not waiting for my brother to get out of prison to get married?,"I recently proposed to my fiancé and we are getting married, my mom is saying that i am being incredibly selfish for not waiting an extra year to get married so that my older brother can be release from prison and attend my wedding.

AITA for calling my husband out on being selfish about our free time?,"So my (24F) husband (24M) is a home body for the most part. If he doesn’t have to leave the house he is happy as a clam and usually so am I! We both work during the week, and I also work Saturday’s but he does not. So Sunday is our only day off we have together. Usually they consist of going to the gym, grocery shopping, then coming home where he plays video games to his hearts content and I just dick around on my phone or will watch something. I really don’t mind the video games at all, if I ask if we can watch a movie together or something like that he will shut it down and we the watch something. 


So I’m 31 weeks pregnant, I now have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes so I have to eat carefully and track what I’m eating. We live in a rural southern town where restaurants around here do not cater to that at all because everything is fried and sugary. But we live about 40 minutes from a big city with literally every option of food you can think of for any meal. Now I know the point hasn’t come yet but here’s a short back story.

He told me that when he was with his ex she called him selfish quite a lot and explained how, and I kinda understood it. He’s a wonderful guy but for some reason he gets very weird about doing something he hasn’t planned and can get very mean. I wanted to go to a pumpkin patch last year and he threw a fit over it for over an hour AFTER I said we don’t have to go. 

So back to the point, I wanted to eat downtown because A) we don’t have a lot of quality time and our time is about to be taken over by a new born, and b) I wanted to get some food I enjoy especially because we don’t go out often due to Covid and because he never wants to. So I asked him and he immediately got annoyed at my idea and said things like “okay fine let’s just go eat breakfast at 1 in the afternoon.” And “what about everything we already planned? Is that suddenly not important?” Talking about the gym and grocery shopping. So I said it was just an idea and we didn’t have to go. He then sighs and says “fine where do you wanna go?” And I say seriously it really isn’t a big deal and we can just plan it for next weekend. Which then he responds “nope you had to make such a big deal about it today so we are going.” 

I finally just had enough and said “look just because it doesn’t consist of staying home and playing video games doesn’t mean you might not have a good time, but there’s no need to be passive aggressive and freak out.”  He then said I was the one being rude and inconsiderate about asking to go and hasn’t talked to me since. 


Sorry this was long and all over the place but was I actually being an AH because I suggested we get breakfast?

EDIT: thank you for everyone’s comments! It’s really appreciated! Definitely learning that communication and compromise are two things we need to be working on, and I’m definitely gonna take everyone’s suggestions to try and plan things in advance more!

EDIT #2: so I didn’t know if it would start a fight but I decided to show him everyone’s responses and he immediately felt very guilty. He said “this isn’t an excuse but growing up my mom would shut down anyone else’s plans but hers so now I really value my time and being able to plan” and I said “I don’t mean this to be mean but so you kinda turned into your mom then?” And he just stopped and I think something kinda clicked because he suddenly looked very embarrassed. We ended up having an in depth conversation about the future and baby and what we both need to change so I guess now we just wait and see.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if we name our daughter after my grandmother?,"My wife and I are expecting our first child, a girl. My wife is currently pregnant.

My grandmother recently passed away. She was a strong woman and cared a lot about me and even my wife after we started dating. My wife's grandparents died before she was born so my grandmother was an elderly figure for her. 

Long story short, my grandmother was strong, brave, and courageous. She had a lot of health issues but stayed strong throughout all her surgeries and medical procedures before she sadly passed away. Before she became ill, she spent a lot of time with me and my family. 

My wife and I really love her and miss her.

I thought it would be really nice to name our daughter after my grandmother since my grandmother was such an influential and amazing person in my entire family's lives. 

There's only problem - my grandmother's legal name is Baby. 

Yes, that's right, Baby. Even as an adult, her friends, family, and pretty much everyone would call her Baby because that's what her name was. 


My wife said that my grandmother is from a different generation and that our daughter would be bullied or teased if we named her that. 

I think our daughter should ignore the bullies and explain to them the significance behind the name if needed.

AITA for getting mad at my(25f) mom(42f) for considering getting my brother(14m) a hamster?,"Some background info:

My mother had me very young. She got pregnant at 15 and had me at 16. As you can imagine, she struggled with parenting in some aspects. She is a very good person and always tried her best but I can't say I don't hold a bit of resentment for not having a more stable childhood. 

When me and my other brother were young (she had another baby at 18) she worked at a pet store. She would always end up taking all the animals home that didn't get picked. At one point we had 5 hamsters, rabbits, rats, almost any small pet you can think of. Proper care for these animals wasn't as well known or easy to research as it is now, so these animals lived very cramped and depressing lives. Also having all these animals with such short life spans and no real regard to how they're treated kind of messed up my view of the value of life as a kid. 

My mom has reigned in the animal situation since then, but she still has 3 cats and 2 dogs. My youngest brother is 14 and doesn't really help with any of them unless basically forced. He's been insisting he wants a hamster for his upcoming birthday. Knowing what I know about my mom and my brother, she's likely to cave and end up taking care of it. 

She asked me what she should do and I told her not to do it. It isnt fair to the animal to be treated like a gift to be forgotten. This is where I may be the asshole. I was actually pretty upset she was considering it because she was mimicking the same parenting she did as a teen. She would give in to most things we wanted short term to make us happy, but not consider the long term effects. I feel like growing up this way stunted my emotional growth, along with other things. It's been hard for me to deal with as an adult. I don't want my brother to end up with the same issues I did. 

When she defended her considering it, I kind of snapped. I said she needs to realize the impact her actions have on her kids. I said I didn't want her to ruin my brother. She got upset about this and said she wouldn't ask me anymore. AITA?

Edit for info on my brother: I know for 99% certain that he will not properly care for the hamster. Simple things like chore charts get disregarded after a week or less. He's also had multiple beta fish that died in filth because he wouldn't clean the tank or properly remember to feed them.",Not the A-hole
AITA for laughing at my mom after she and my dad insisted i tell my friend’s boyfriend to leave my house?,"I (F20) moved out on my 18th birthday and never looked back. I mostly moved out due to how strict my parents were. When i say strict, i don’t mean something like home by 10pm. I mean, I wasn’t allowed to have friends older than me (even by a few months) i wasn’t allowed any guy friends. If i had a project to work on at school and got partnered with a guy, my mom would tell my teachers to make me do it alone. I was only allowed on my phone if someone (mom or dad) was there to monitor what i was doing. Weekdays my bedtime was 9pm and weekends 9:30pm. I could only have sleepovers if it was at my house and all of my friends have to be questioned to make sure they were “clean” meaning, they didn’t have boyfriends, no tattoos, went to church, you get it. 

So you can imagine, i had literally 1 or 2 friends. By 18, i didn’t have any plans, i just packed my stuff and left. My parents weren’t happy and tried for months to get me to come home but i didn’t plan on it. Anyways, i landed a damn good job and was able to get my first apartment shortly after. My friend is over at my house almost everyday with her boyfriend and we just hang out. 

I didnt cut out all contact with my parents but i limit it to only only special occasions. My mom wanted to have a zoom family call whatever it’s called and asked me to join. I figured what the hell i’ll join and say hi. As i’m talking to my little cousin, in the background you could see my friend’s boyfriend come into the living room area. Everyone’s face kinda froze and i didn’t think much of it. 

My mom asked who it was and i told her and she immediately gets annoyed? She started asking why he was leaving my bedroom, which he didn’t. The bathroom is the same way towards the bedroom so i could see why it would look like he left from my room. She and my dad proceeds to ask me why i have guys at my home, why is he 21 hanging around me (i just turned 20 but yea) it was like i was 15 again

My mom then insists i have him leave. At this point my friend and her boyfriend hears this and goes like wtf? I didn’t know what else to do but laugh. I said “are you out of your mind” and laughed some more. I realized they were serious and said my goodbyes and hung up. Later i started getting messages that my parents are upset i laughed at them and my family says it’s in my best interest to apologize because i was being an asshole for laughing. AITA for laughing?

~~~
Edit- I did not expect to have this much feedback! Thank you everyone who took time to comment and a big thank you for the awards! 

For those of you asking why i would think i was the asshole, it’s mostly cause i laughed at them then hung up so i thought it was rude and asshole-ish especially after being told i was by my aunt as well.

I seen a lot of people telling me to go no contact. I’d feel terrible if i did such a thing but someone did point out they’ll never change their ways so i think i might have to. you know, i’ve got no idea how to set boundaries but i’m sure there’s a few articles that can help me with that. I did block them from all of my social media accounts except facebook so i think that counts? I’m not familiar with setting boundaries sorry

I found out from my little cousin that my mom has been asking where i live so now i’m kind of scared for that. Though not many know my address, if she ask the right people she might find out i hope not.",Not the A-hole

Last night she sat me down and started talking about it and I freaked out and said that we were NOT rehoming him.

AITA for not allowing my grandson's half brother to visit us?,"My grandson (Mac, 16M) is our late son's son. Our son died when Mac was 6 and his mother (Alice) got remarried and now has another son (8M). Our grandson visits my husband and I every year and we've never had any sort of trouble with Alice or her current husband. 

Unfortunately last year Mac was unable to visit for obvious reasons but now, the situation where we live has changed and he can now come and visit us. Trouble is that Mac's half brother also wants to come along this time. Alice asked whether it would be ok for the half brother to tag along with Mac for 1/3 weeks Mac is visiting since he really wants to come along and she thinks it'll be good for him to leave the city for a while as well. Mac was also wants to bring his half brother cause he wants to show the brother our animals. Mac kept saying he'll take care of his brother and we don't have to worry. 

I wasn't keen on the idea of the brother tagging along so I told Alice that he can't come. Alice didn't really push the point but Mac called me begging me to allow him to bring his little brother since it's only for a week. But I refused since I really don't know the kid too well and he's not my grandson. I have nothing to do with him. Alice sent me a message saying that she understands if I don't want the 8 year old to visit but she feels a little hurt because she considers us to be her family and it hurts to know that we don't consider her and her son our family. But again we do love our actual grandson and have him over every year. I have nothing against Mac's half brother but he's not my grandson. He has his own grandparents. It's also a little weird that Mac who is 16 wants to bring along his 8 year old brother so I suspect maybe Alice is making him say these things. 

Mac is now refusing to visit us and saying he'd rather stay home. But I think he's bluffing. He enjoys visiting us. My husband thinks we should just let it go and allow Mac's half brother to visit as well since we have the space. But I think that if we stand firm, Mac will come visit us anyway. 

I'm not really trying to hurt anyone. I just want my grandson to visit us not his brother even if he is easy to take care of. I don't understand why Alice thinks it's appropriate to ask anyway. AITA?",Asshole
WIBTA if I told my roommate's employer about her drug use?,"My friend works a high stress job in a field that you are dealing with emergencies all of the time. She is very good at her job, and is consistently in the top employees. She is head hunted by other companies consistently, her employer has raised her wages twice in the past 6 months to keep her.  


Her job has gotten higher stress due to a few factors, and she was having chest pains. She went to cardiology, and it ended up being anxiety so she had to go to psych. Her psych gives her anti-anxiety medication to take up to three times a day.  


She mentioned to me the other day that she had to take up to 4 the one day because work was so rough. I told her she should consult with her doctor first, but she became defensive and said her doctor okayed it as long as it was only occasionally and not consistently (so I don't think she consulted her doctor at all.)

AITA for telling my daughter that she's crazy for not being over guys from her past?,"My daughter is 24 years old. She is currently dating a guy who is marriage material and extremely good for her. He treats her super well and I really like the young man.

My daughter however blames her anxiety for her crappy moral compass. She has dated some guys in the past who ended up hurting her or who were assholes to her. Despite being with a good guy now, I have come to find out that she is still a bit fixated on these guys from her past.

I looked at her social media accounts and see these guys in her search history and have come to find that she constantly checks up on them and their girlfriends on all platforms. It seems like she has an obsession with keeping tabs on them. She has fake instagram accounts where she views their girlfriends stories to see what's going on.

Last year, she dated (unofficially) one guy for a couple months who was a complete jerk to her and he has tried to reach out to her multiple times over the past few months. She has ignored him out of respect for her current boyfriend but I saw her texts to her friends saying that it stirred up feelings for her.

The worst thing I found out about lately was that she made some fake dating app profile with some girl's pictures to match with this guy from her past and talk to him and see what he's up to.

This was the final straw for me so I confronted her. We got into a huge fight and I told her that her behavior is completely unhinged and asked why she's acting so crazy. She got really upset and told me that she doesn't know what's wrong with her and that she can't control it and wants to get on anxiety medication to stop the ruminations about her past.

I told her to stop blaming her psycho behavior on ""anxiety"" and she hasn't spoken to me in a few days. My husband said I was an AH and handled the whole situation poorly.

Me: why?

AITA? I told my mom how negligent she is with her kids.... on her birthday.,"Told my(25f) mom(50) everything I thought about her and how negligent she is....On her birthday. AITA?

I’m going to try to keep the story short - my mom has been divorced from her second marriage for 5 years now. In that time period, she has worked on “finding herself” which has translated to doing some hippy dippy crystal holistic approaches, spending time dating and being gone all the time. Even the weeks she has the kids. the problem I see here is how much she just focuses on herself and not her 3 kids (8-13) that she has 1/2 custody of. She is also terrible with money, she will blow through all her child support and alimony before the month is over, not because it isn’t enough but because of frivolous spending. The kids had to do remote learning last year, and she didn’t pay the internet bill so they didn’t get attendance grades. So much of a concern to one of the kids teacher, that the teacher called CPS. This is one of many examples I think she is so negligent. 

Today is her birthday, and she has been gone all day. She left the kids with my very unstable 20y/o sister. There was a big blowout with the kids and one of them not wanting to go back in the house and said “not until mom comes home”. Mom doesn’t answer the phone and it’s 10pm... 20yo sister is having a meltdown and I’m trying to calm her down on the phone while trying to get ahold of my mother. Once mom reaches out and says “what, I’m with my friends it’s my birthday” I lost it. I told her how negligent she was being to those kids and a lot more. AITA for ruining her birthday?

Edit: wow I was feeling so alone and emotional and I didn’t know who to talk to, so I resorted to all you friendly internet strangers. I have spent years trying to get over feeling guilty anytime I speak up or stand up for something, the aftermath of growing up with a very negligent and narcissistic mother. This time I am really done with it, since it is affecting my siblings. I forgave my mother for how she was when I was a child, but I can’t forgive her for how she is raising my siblings. She had a second chance and completely butchered it. 
My stepfather was incredibly emotionally and verbally abusive to me and my biological sister growing up. We testified against him when my mom was initially in court divorcing him. I have a hard time even mentioning him, and while I know the kids will be better with him than my mom - it’s really difficult to think about speaking to him. However, I do think that I owe it to my siblings. When I was their age, I wish someone did something too.

"AITA for ""making"" my boyfriend pay half the rent?","I'm 27f and make about $130k, $30k of that being from a side hustle.  My bf of 2.5 years is 28m and makes $80k, no side hustle. I'm really serious about saving and only spend about $2500 a month, $1600 of that being rent. Occasionally I do something expensive and fun, like a week-long cruise I went on with friends before the pandemic, but I don't eat out more than once a month, I buy clothes maybe once every other year, and my car is almost old enough to vote. 

My bf is different. He does have an emergency fund and saves 10% of his salary in his company 401k (and gets a 4% employer match), but that's it. Everything that comes in goes out. He eats out everyday, leases an expensive car, and is always buying things. I don't know where his money goes and tbh I don't think he does either. I don't love his spending habits but I'm okay with it. Saving 10% is more than a lot of people do, and he doesn't have any credit card debt, so whatever. 

The issue is that he's supposed to be moving into my apartment next month. He currently lives in a house with 3 other guys and pays $800 a month. If we split the rent on my apartment, he would still pay $800 a month. I think that's more than fair, but he wants to pay $600 and me pay $1000. His argument is that I make a lot more money than him and expenses should be proportional, and he also says it's not fair that my rent is going to decrease by 50% and his is going to stay the same. 

I don't agree because I don't think what rent we paid before we lived together really has anything to do with the 'fairness' of the arrangement, and he can clearly afford $800/month since he's already been paying it (I would feel differently if he really would struggle to pay half the rent, but it's 12% of his salary. Come on). My flat salary is also only $20k more than his; the reason I make so much more is because I sometimes work nights and weekends. He could make extra money doing that too but chooses not to. I don't really see why I should be punished for it. 

I told him I would be willing to compromise with a 700/900 split, on the condition that he took the $100 he was saving and put it aside into a fund for us to buy a house one day (and that money would be his to do whatever he wanted if we ended up breaking up). He got mad and said I was treating him like a child, that his finances are none of my business, and it's totally inappropriate for me to tell him what to do with his money.

AITA for not wanting a friend to answer my husband's phone?,"My (28f) hubby (42m) works in sales. My friend (24f) also does too. My hubby and my friend were working on the same crew, trying to beat a divisional record. In order to do that, they were working from 9am to sometimes 11pm to 12am, 6, sometimes 7 days a week.

EDIT: Since everyone assumes due to the times I stated he works, that he's definitely cheating. The times are irrelevant in that aspect and I only said them to show how much time they were in close proximity. I have worked this same job and have worked same or later hours.

So anyways one day, I called him while he's out working and SHE answers. Asked where he was and she tells me in a house and she'll have him call me back. Okay, no problem. This continues for a better part of 2 weeks however. Sometimes I'll get him on the phone, most times I'd get her. Since he was in a house closing a deal, I tried not to care. Then one day I call, she answers. She's chatting with me and I hear him in the background, getting into the car. She tells me she'll call me back (as if I called HER phone instead of his) and DOESN'T EVEN GIVE THE PHONE TO HIM AND HANGS UP.

I talk to him that night and explain that I really don't like calling my husband only to have a girl, even my friend, pick up and why the fuck does she always seem to have his phone and he doesn't? He basically tells me that it's no big deal, other dealers are calling and he's letting her answer and he needs her to do that. I tell him fine, but to have her stop answering when I call him because I don't want to talk to her when I call him, I want to talk to him and tell him to give the dealers her number then.

I call him the next day, she picks up. We have the same conversation that night. Then I texted him the next day telling him, ""please have that conversation with friend because I'm getting tired of hearing a chick's voice when I call my husband. It implies a level of familiarity that I'm not comfortable with""......and guess who texts me? Friend. She had not only had my hubbys phone but she read the message I sent him and is telling me, ""I didn't know it bothered you. Id never do anything with hubs, why are you so upset? I can't believe you'd think that about me? Why would I care if she answers?"" Ect. I texted her back that this was exactly the reason why I was upset, that I couldn't seem to call or text my husband's phone and get my husband and I didn't care who it was, I don't want a woman answering his phone.

She called me an AH and said I was over reacting and she wouldn't do that. I just basically told her that her texting me just made the whole situation worse. She apparently was terrified I was going to fight her, even pregnant?

I just don't feel like you should be answering someone else's phone, especially when they aren't your spouse. Even if you're my friend, I'm not calling your phone, I'm calling his. And us being friends doesn't give her free reign of my man's phone. Her phone was working at the time. Nothing wrong with it. He could've given the dealers her number. She could've. It was never necessary for her to have his phone.

So am I the AH for not wanting my friend to answer my hubbys phone?",Not the A-hole
"AITA for asking if we could skip a movie, and therefore 'ruining' our movie night?","So me and my friends, we'll call them A, B, C, and D, had a movie night on Netflix party and the Disney+ group service. A, usually picks out the best movies and we almost always like her movies, so we let her pick out the movies. 

I get dizzy, and or light headed when i see blood. This happens to my mom too, my mom has also fainted due to too much blood, and while i haven't fainted i don't want to take chances. One of the movies A picked out was the Old Guard on Netflix, my parents started watching the Old Guard and stopped bc there was too much blood for my mom. My parents recommended i don't watch that movie and i trust them bc they know my limits.

So i went on our group chat and said : ""Hey, can we skip Old Guard bc it has a lot of blood in it?""  
A, B, C, & D have been there when i got lightheaded and dizzy due to blood so they know that i don't react well to it.

A said: ""sure, we already have like 5 more movies picked out, lmao""  
B said: ""sure, idc lol""  
C said: ""np i've already watched it anyways  >w<""  
D said nothing in the group chat.

A couple minutes later i got a private message from D, saying that if i wanted to skip a movie that i should just not attend, and i was ruining it for everyone. that got me thinking maybe my friends really wanted to see the movie.

So i went back to the group chat and said: ""If you guys want, i can leave while you watch old guard so you can still watch it""

A, B, and C said it's fine we don't have to watch it.

So i went back to my private chat with D and said, i'm sorry if you think i've ruined it, i just can't tolerate blood""

D, read that message but didn't respond.

During the movie night D was dismissive and rude to me, and kind of made fun of the fact i can't deal w/ blood. Ever since the movie night D didn't talk to me.

AITA for not letting “BD” see my son anymore?,"For reference BD means BabyDaddy and you’ll find out why it’s in quotations in a minute. Also I’m on mobile 

I (22f) have 2 sons (3&2) my youngest is for my now fiancé but I’ve been with him since my oldest was 3 months. So when I got pregnant I believed my oldest was for my ex I was with at the time. After I had him my mom would always make comments because Im white but my ex is black & my son looked white. I know it can happen so I ignored her.

So I went visit my cousin and her gf’s brother was there (he’s white). I had a one night stand with him but no where near the time I got pregnant. He saw my son & swore he was his & to my surprise when I’m back home I get a message from my cousin saying her gfs brother did a dna test behind my back and my son was his. I had my suspicions but I saw the dna test and believed it cause I didn’t think it was fake. he stops coming around after a week.
After a while I texted my “BD” and told him either he helped or I put him on child support bc we were struggling. So he agreed and also wanted to see our son. since then he’s been in my sons life buying pull-ups here and there not much but my fiancé got a better job so we were ok. 

my fiancé has always claimed my oldest on taxes bc “BD” isn’t on the birth certificate & we have him more and pay more for him. A couple weeks ago “BD” wanted our sons social to claim him and I politely said no and explained why. So he gets pissed 

I get a message from “BD” sister apologizing to me telling me that the dna test they took on my son was fake & that “BD” was taking me to court to take my son. So I message “BD” and let him know since he wanted to do this he won’t get my son until a judge says. I get a call a couple days later from my mom saying “BD” called her crying bc he got a real paternity test and my son isn’t his. 

I’m sad for my son lbut at the same time I’m not surprised. Now “BD” has been calling me trying to blame me for this & he’s had his gf and her family threaten me so much. I blocked them but before I did I told him “I am not the one to blame for this. I told you in the beginning he wasn’t yours because of the dates but you wanted to be his daddy so mf bad that you faked a dna test and tricked me. Now you get mad over taxes, try to take my son from me, and end up getting your feelings hurt. This is no ones fault but your own.” 

I do feel dumb bc I knew I should have went with my gut and did my own dna test when they showed me that fake one. But now my mom is saying I’m an AH bc my son is not going over there bc 1 he tried taking my son from me, 2 he’s not his father, and 3 I’ve been being threatened constantly by them and they family. I tell my son that “BD” moved away when he’s older then I will explain everything to him. I have a few people in my family that have been calling me an AH as well and saying I’m bitter. Obviously I don’t think I’m wrong at all but I wanna see what other people think.

ETA: someone told me I should add this. My son doesn’t really see “BD” as a dad bc he didn’t try and actually see my son until later. Yes my son loves him but doesn’t call him dad he calls my fiancé dad even though we’ve tried explaining to him. But now the only reason my son isn’t going around him anymore is the constant threats to me and my family and him trying to blame me for him being in a kids life that isn’t his. At this point he doesn’t even really care to see my son it’s only his family and my family that think I should still send him even tho he doesn’t want my son anymore bc he isn’t his. All he cares about now is the little bit of money he has spent here and there these past years and the $400 paternity test he got done. My son will know who his real father is tho because I have contacted my ex and explained everything and we agreed to start letting him get to know his son. We are gonna start with him coming over and seeing his son to get to know him and once our son is used to him we will slowly start letting our son go spend nights and everything at his house.

Also the threats I’m getting now is threats about physical harm to me, my fiancé, and even my youngest son.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not helping my former roommate until she apologizes for things she said during a manic episode?,"I (27F) recently received a request from someone I last spoke with in 2017 (Tiffany, 26F) on a professional networking website. I get a lot of requests for informational interviews/job referrals/etc, often from total strangers, on this site because I work in a field that sounds cool and glamorous to outsiders who often misunderstand exactly what it entails, though when it comes down to it, it's a job like any other (though I happen to enjoy what I do and believe in the mission). So I often ignore the requests unless there's a compelling reason to respond.

Apparently Tiffany wants to get into the field I'm in and thought I'd be a good person to contact. Normally, I'd be happy to talk with someone I actually know about it, even if it had been a few years since I've spoken to them. However, about a month before our lease ended, Tiffany and I had a minor disagreement over something in the house (I barely even remember the details anymore) and apparently the disagreement coincided with a manic episode that was a symptom of a diagnosed mental illness she had. And it escalated from a minor fight that I was trying to reach an acceptable conclusion/compromise for to something terrible.

She said some truly horrible things to me. It was like she looked into my heart and brain, saw my biggest insecurities, and confirmed not only that I was correct, but that they were far worse than I ever believed. She also insulted some of my family members she had met, calling my intellectually disabled aunt a slur, and accusing my dad of unspeakable things. I understand that she did not have control over the episode, I really do. But the pain and trauma caused by this event was and is still very real to me. I mostly avoided her, just being polite and courteous for the rest of the lease and she did the same.

After I ignored the request, our third roommate (Lily, 25F) who was not present during the event but vaguely knew the details, contacted me (we are still acquaintances) and asked why I ignored Tiffany's request because apparently Tiffany told her I ignored it. I told her I honestly was still hurt by what happened. I conceded that an apology, which I never received, would be good enough for me to help a little (probably not enough refer her to jobs at my company but give some helpful advice otherwise). Lily communicated what I said and Tiffany got angry, saying that asking for an apology for something she had no control over was ableist on my part, and that I should have asked for one years ago if it really mattered to me, and not just have her ""come begging on her knees"" (her words) when I ""finally get the chance for revenge"" (also her words).",Not the A-hole
"AITA for attending ""guys night""?","I (24F) have a fairly large group of friends and within this large group I have a smaller, more intimate group of friends. My smaller group are made up of 6 guys and myself. These are the people I am truly comfortable with and they mean a lot to me. 

4 out of the 6 guys are in relationships. The girls are nice, and we get along well but they are much closer to each other and hang out often. 

So the guys normally hang out with their other best friends who I was not really familiar with and do stuff some weekends. While I'm invited most of the time, I don't go on these outing with them because it's usually really late and I don't feel safe being out. Sometimes they will just hang out at one friends house and have sort of a guys night, which I have been invited to and attended a few times. 

I really enjoyed getting to know their other friends, and I actually got really close to one of them (I'll call him M).

The girls started getting annoyed that I was invited for these ""guys nights"" and demanded to know why I was allowed at these events and they were not. The guys explain that it because I'm am their friend and ""like one of the guys"" and they want one night without their girlfriends. They were pissed but got over it. Also another reason is most of the time this event happens at M's house and he wants me to attend.

So M and I began dating a month ago and another ""guys night"" was coming up. The girls were complaining about it and mentioned that I will know what it's like for them when this happens so I told them that I was still invited and going.

AITA for telling my mother to abandon her dreams of me ever having kids?,"So for some context I am asexual and aromantic (ace aro for short), which means that I am not sexually or romantically attracted to anyone.

My mother has always wanted grandchildren, and for some odd reason, has especially wanted me to have kids. Every once in a while she would ask me if I had met, ""that special someone"" to which I would reply that I hadn't.

About 6 months ago, I came out to my family as ace aro. Most of my family took it pretty well and respect me for it. My father, mother, and older brother, however, did not. 

I fully explained that I had no intention of marriage or having children. My mother blew it off saying that ""you'll meet that special person soon."" No matter how many times I explained it to her, she would remain purposefully ignorant.

It frustrated me beyond words.

This continued about every three days for six months

After about being asked if I had ""met that special someone yet"" today, I blew up. I started yelling at her that she will never get grandchildren from me, that if she wants grandchildren ask any of my three siblings. I finished with saying, ""and if none of them (referring to my siblings) want kids, then give up on your dreams of having grandkids""

She got furious at me, screaming that I would, ""grow out of this soon"" I told her to fuck off.

I then stayed in my room for most of the day. I got several angry texts from my mother, brother, and father telling me how bad of a son I am.

AITA for sharing the results of a study with my gf,"We've been dating for around 2 years and the pandemic hit us both very hard. We both put on some weight. At the beginning we were both at the low end of the BMI spectrum. After a year of self isolating she's got a bit into the overweight range. I don't mind at all, I love her, she's the most beautiful woman to me, but I know she does. She's been overweight before, lost a ton of weight and was very proud and now she feels like a failure.

She's now started counting calories again and has lost quite a bit of weight but has more to go in her opinion. She was very proud and excited she finally managed to get back on track but was also upset and disgusted with herself for allowing herself to get to where she did, in her words. 

Today we were talking about eating disorders and such and she mentioned she may have someone. A bit of research later and I stumbled upon a very solid paper showing people who ate a more balanced breakfast, rich in protein were shown to lose more weight, more consistently. I was very excited about it as I want to adopt a better lifestyle myself so I talked to her about it. She kept insisting she can't do that and there have to be exceptions, that if she eats a bigger breakfast she feels anxious she'll be hungry later and binge so she prefers to skip breakfast or eat a smaller one to save calories for later.

I didn't catch on at all that she was distressed and told her everyone in the study who ate balanced, protein rich breakfasts lost more weight and did better  overall. She broke down. Started crying and asked me to please stop, that this was making her anxious snd she felt like she was set up to fail now, that the one thing that worked for her isn't good and she's feeling absolutely hopeless and helpless.

I don't know how to handle this tbh, I stopped talking and apologised but she's still sad and upset. I really didn't think it was that big of a deal and I was trying to help but apparently I upset her and came across as dismissing her method.

I'm going to apologise anyway, I'm just wondering if I was actually an AH or if it was an isolated and unfortunate incident.",Asshole

AITA For Unintentionally Triggering My Friend?,"So me and my friend (I’ll call them X) have been talking about getting an apartment together for when we go back to college in the Fall. They asked me back in December, and I said I would be interested if they were staying for the whole year (they might have graduated a semester early). They told me they were in for the whole year, and we just finished virtually touring a place that we both liked yesterday. 

Today X messaged me saying that they wouldn’t be able to afford the apartment for the whole year, and that they would be just getting it for half the year or not getting it at all. X’s mom was also making calls to other apartment places and making decisions without including me, so I told X I was going to message X’s mom. I asked if I could have more insight into what was going on since I wanted to know if I was being left on my own for housing or if I would have to deal with subleasing the apartment (of which I can’t afford to take over their half of the lease). I was also starting to get stressed about signing up for dorms last minute and having to get a random roommate. 

Friend X told me that I was just making things worse. I tried calling X’s mom and they started telling me to stop, and that because of me X’s mom wasn’t going to let them go back to school or pay for anything. I asked why she didn’t want to talk with me, and X said that their mom was now mad at them for involving me and was calling them immature and other things of that caliber. I said I just wanted to talk and didn’t mean to make things worse, which is when they kinda snapped and told me too bad, I made things worse. Of which I snapped back and told them “Sorry you ever got to know me. I’m sure your life would be better off without me.” 

After that things started calming down, but I was  still pissed about the situation. I told them I was pissed but trying to stay calm and I had apologized for my previous message. They came back at me saying how they’re also having to deal with this aftermath, with a very negative tone.

I messaged them recently with a more thought out apology, and they told me that what I said/caused messed them up all day, causing them to have several instances where their mental health spiraled severely. I know they have a disorder, but I didn’t think that my messages were that bad. Even though I’ve apologized repeatedly, I’m split over whether or not the whole situation was entirely my fault.

AITA For refusing to look after my sister?,"My little sister is autistic and has no sense of self. She's thirteen, but she's the kind of person that would get into a stranger's car if they offered to give her candy. She's technically high functioning but she just has no idea how the world works. 

Anyway, our dad died this year and he was my sister's primary caretaker. Mum is kind of going insane, but I still dont think she should be my responsibility. 

I go out a lot, just walking, to clear my head. A few times mum has forced me to take her with me. She's hard to deal with and I don't want to take her. I like to walk with my music on, but I can't do that because I have to make sure she doesn't wander out into the middle of the road or something. I'm getting pretty angry with it.

Two days ago she forced me to take my sister again, I said no and ran. I guess my mum thought I'd come to my senses and sent my sister to follow me.

To a point where I get behind the wheel and immediately get tunnel vision and everything goes blurry. So when my GF got her license at 16, she tried forcing me to go in and get mine but I just wasnt ready. This was the very beginning of our relationship.

She has continued to harp on me over the years to get my license despite the fact that I dont technically even need it. The home I am renting is literally right next door to my work. The grocery store is literally right across the street. Hospital is only a mile away. I can quite literally walk everywhere and I have been doing so since I moved here at age 20. I enjoy this. But she still harped on me, which caused numerous fights. 

Back 3 months ago I went to a buddies house and while there, we ended up having a few drinks. My GF was mad because she made plans for us without me knowing and picked a fight. She ends up going home and drinking (I didnt know this). Later I told her my buddy was drinking so he couldnt drive me home and that I was just going to stay the night. She insisted on coming to get me; again, I had no knowledge that she was drinking. She got pulled over and got a DUI and lost her license for a year. She gave me an ultimatum. Either get my license or shes gone because it was ""my fault"" that she lost her license (I realize it's not but she tries blaming me). Didnt want her to leave so I sucked up my fear and got it.

"AITA for snapping at my friend that keeps saying it'd be ""cool to be blind""?","  

I have a 3-year-old daughter that is mostly blind, as a side effect of her albinism. Because of this, her other senses are heightened. Most people find it to be super cool and express that they wish that. However, sensory overload is a thing. I have watched my daughter freak out at noises that most of us would consider normal, but to her, it’s overwhelming. Some textures (food, fabric, etc) are just too much for her. Smell and taste aren’t so bad, at least I don’t know yet as she’s so young. It’s not all bad but I really hate the romanization people with all of their senses in tact. I’ve spoken to other people (adults) with my daughter’s condition and they agree, they hate hearing it. My daughter doesn’t realize people are like this and doesn’t have an opinion, but I do want to take away the stigma that a disability with “cool” side effects doesn’t mean someone should romanticize it. Think how people without OCD think it’s cool or quirky, when really it’s incredibly difficult to live with. That’s how people have treated my daughter.

That being said, I have a friend we’ll call Debbie. Debbie is very nice, well meaning. She cares deeply for my daughter. However, she is one of the people that constantly says “oh, I wish I could lose some of my sight so I could appreciate things with touch or taste more”. I’ve said, no, you don’t, as it’s not as cool as you think. I’ve spoken with her about how insensitive it can be and she says she’ll do better, but then doesn’t. Recently she made a comment about how being blind must be so “peaceful”. I said I can’t speak for my daughter in that regard, but mostly she gets frustrated and can at times, get quite sad. She kept insisting, no, no one day she’ll find it peaceful. It was really bothering me and I just tried to change the subject. Then she started on her “I wish I could lose some sight” BS again and I just snapped. I told her that she is being super insensitive and that being blind isn’t cool or something to wish for. I said I wouldn’t change my daughter or think it’s impossible for her to have a good life, but it’s still not easy.

Debbie got mad and said that I can’t speak on this, as I’m not blind. I said no, but I have a child who is and I’ve had to deal with the reality. She told me that I can’t tell her how to feel and that maybe she would like to be blind.

Another friend of ours says I was wrong and I can’t tell Debbie how she’d feel. To me, I think maybe I overreacted but overall I’m just frustrated with her brushing off how challenging it can be to be blind.",Not the A-hole
AITA For having a friend contact someone who I really cared about after they blocked me for no reason (that I could see)?,"Met them online through someone else I found in a game, this doesn't really matter. Me and them messaged back and forth very actively, they quickly became my new favorite person. They live in a different state then I do so them blocking all contact is 10x easier and 10x more devastating to me. I worried about them a lot, like a lot a lot, and cared about them more than I worried. Messaging them was literally my favorite thing to do, and getting a discord notification was never so exciting knowing it could be from them.

Well that doesn't really matter, just knowing that I cared about them a lot does. They have issues with past toxic relationships and do not process people caring about them well. It's clear that I drove them away and I know I'm an asshole for not connecting the dots that were 2 inches apart, they just seemed happy like I did when I told them I cared about them then so I stopped worrying about it. Probably unironically the biggest mistake of my life.

Well I was a mess after they blocked me with a flimsy excuse, and a much bigger one when I realized they blocked me, unfriended me, and left every server we share in common. I was overwhelmed with depression and self-hate and regret and just missing them, terrified that I would never hear from them again. Spoiler, I wouldn't (At least it's been a month I pray I will but I know I won't).

Before I connected the clear, so fucking clear dots of me caring about them driving them away, I was really confused and hurt as why the left, so, after being bullied into by my friends (like they just bugged me about it), I gave the go ahead for a friend to message them asking if or when they will unblock me. I regretted it almost immediately, I kind of hoped they just forgot about me and remembering will unblock me, and after a hopeful hour I realized what I did.

See later that very night a friend of theirs messaged me saying she felt bad that I didn't at least know why they left, and it was because they don't handle people caring about them well. Can't call myself a big enough dumbass, they even told me! Again they just seemed really happy, and I was really happy, so I kind of just stopped worrying about that.

Well I had a friend message them, and that was just not an ok thing to do, for a variety of reasons. They probably forgot about me, and the simple fact is I chose myself to not suffer over them. They probably forgot about me and felt guilty knowing that I missed them, which was just not ok. I probably would've suffered for like 6 months, and they probably would've been uncomfortable for a minute. That doesn't matter though, I still chose myself over them. The ratio of time would have been 262974:1 and I should've chose myself suffering for all those months, she matters more than 262974 times more than me, and I was selfish, and I can't forgive myself.

The story of my bio dad and I (24F) is pretty cliche. My parents had me and my twin bro (24M) in high school, got married, and stayed together for a few years before divorcing. After that my dad went into the military and my mom remarried (twice).

For most of my life, my contact with my dad was limited due to being stationed a few states away. If he wasn't deployed, he would come to visit us during the holidays and our birthdays, and sometimes, if possible, we'd fly out to stay with him for a week or so. Overall, I'd consider it a distant but positive relationship. He and I were always close.

In general, I think my father is some who, if Bro & I weren't conceived by mistake, would have never had kids because he just doesn't have the patience necessary. He wasn’t a bad father like of dads in this sub are, just a fairly unfit one.

When Bro & I were in high school our father got into hard substances, got kicked out of the military, and eventually ended up in prison, which led to him missing out on Bro & I's graduation. This led to Bro basically disowning him. But I still kept in contact, even though I was angry and ashamed, and still tried to be a supportive daughter.

Four years ago, Dad got out of jail and, with a few stumbles, seemed to get his life together. Starts visiting again for our birthdays & xmas again but, when he couldn't, he always sent $100 to each of us. Bro & Dad even start rebuilding their relationship.

That brings us to now. Dad arrived last Monday for a Christmas visit (this was exciting because he could visit last year because of COVID) and we all went out for lunch. Tuesday we watch movies and eat take-out at Bro's apartment. Wednesday Bro & I both have other commitments so dad plans to visit a friend and we all plan a day out on Thursday to go shopping so Dad can get us xmas gifts.

But Dad never shows and no one could find him.

Long story short, after a solid day of worrying my dad could be dead in a ditch, my uncle gets a call from county jail where Dad has been locked up for a DUI & having possession of illegal substances but made bail.

I PISSED but focus on being glad he isn’t dead. I text him to say that I still want to see him and he replies saying he’d swing by my place in a few hours (it was already mid-afternoon by this point) so we could talk.

It was stupid of me to believe him because of course he never showed. Instead, my uncle (who Dad was staying with) came home from work to most of my dad’s stuff gone and a note on the counter basically saying goodbye forever and that he preferred the money & drugs to his family.

I’ve tried to reach him through his cell, email, and FB just so I could know he was alright but have yet to get a response. Guys, I keep crying and it feels like someone I love died. But I’m also just so angry. I’m sick of loving & defending my dad only to be let down.

WIBTA if I didn’t buy Girl Scout cookies from my sister or donate to the troop,"On mobile so apologies in advance.

So yesterday my mother said “your sister is at 42% of her goal and you should buy cookies to help her reach at least 50%.” Since in March last year I was 235 this morning I was 179.9. I told my mother “when was the last time you’ve seen me eat a cookie.“ Citing and referencing my weight loss.

She said “that’s fair but you should still donate you’re going to donate” I scoffed.

I don’t make a lot of money and if I do spend money it’s because I want to spend it for that particular purpose. I live with my parents and I am currently enrolled in grad school. They like to bring up the fact that I live with them rent free as reasons why I should spend a little bit of money here and there because of the money that I’m saving by not paying rent.

While I know I’m an adult and living with my parents I don’t like the feeling of their hand being in my pocket counting my money. I live in DC and make $1200 a month and go to school my parents combined make 10 times that over $13k a month they could easily donate her entire goal. I don’t count their money and I don’t feel it’s fair for them to count mine even if I do live with them. I also don’t feel it’s fair to force me to donate money even if it is my sister. 

I’m also just reeling back from a holiday season and I shelled out a lot of money. Left and right I feel someone’s always asking me for money. 

P.S.  I am making plans to move out and live on my own as soon as possible.",Not the A-hole
AITA for storming out of my friend's house after he put alcohol in my drink?,"My sister got addicted to drinking, then to cigarettes/vapes, and eventually started doing harder drugs. She's clean now, but due to all this, I absolutely hate alcohol, drugs, and tobacco. I'm extremely against it and all of my friends know this. They don't know that the reason for my hatred for these substances is due to what happened with my sister, but they know that the hatred is there. They have offered me a drink or a hit of a vape so many times and they always get the same answer. They know how much I hate it.

Well, my best friend named H is going to a university in a different country. I don't see him most of the year, and he only flies back a few times out of the year to visit. Well the other day, I was over at H's house along with another friend. This was the last time we'd be able to hang out for a long time, because he was flying back out the next day. We had just gotten to his house and he was going to make pina coladas, which he always makes when I'm over, and we were going to go sit out by the jacuzzi. He always puts alcohol in it for everyone, but he knows to never put any in mine.

Well it was a normal day, we were out by the jacuzzi, I mowed down the pina colada, and he asked me if it tasted good. I replied that it tasted amazing. He then said he put alcohol in it. I thought he was kidding, so I asked him to clarify and he revealed that he actually did put alcohol in it. I got angry, asked him why the fuck he did that knowing that I hate alcohol and never want it, he said ""I knew you'd like it better with alcohol in it. I literally put in a tiny bit, basically a drop, it's not going to have any effect on you"". I said that I have never asked for alcohol in my drink and it wasn't his place to make that decision for me. I told him to go fuck himself and I stormed out of his house. I ignored his calls the rest of the day.

TL;DR: Friend put alcohol in drink knowing I hate alcohol, I got angry and stormed out of house. This was the last time I'd be able to hang out with him for a long time, as he was flying out the next day.

"AITA for getting upset that my husband bought a $1,000 massaging recliner without consulting me first?","My husband has been wanting some seating for the den. He decided on a recliner. I'd rather have a small sofa. He was planning to spend $300-$400. He went to the furniture store without me, even though I clearly wanted to go with him. Alas, I ended up staying home with our grumpy toddler, but I requested that he send pictures. I received no pictures, so I called him to see what was up. He was all excited and said it was a surprise. He comes home and says he bought a $1,000 electric recliner that heats and massages. He bought it on the spot without consulting me or doing any research before making the purchase. He thought I'd be excited, but I was upset. Then he says I'm being ""bitchy"".

AITA for refusing to change my hairstyle?,"So me and my mom wanted to give my cousin a quick visit to give her her christmas present, because we weren't able to give it to her earlier. I just put on a pair of sweatpants, a hoodie and I put my hair in a messy bun. My mom asked me if I wanted to go to my cousins looking like that and I just said yes. She asked me to change my hairstyle, because she thought it didn't look good, but I told her I'm good and I think it looks just fine. She blew up at me about how I can never do anything for her and that if I loved her I would change my hairstyle and she said I looked like a homeless person. I told her I thought I looked good and I don't want to change it. Now she doesn't want to go anymore and she is mad at me. I don't think I did something wrong here, I know I could have just changed my hair and my outfit, but why should I? Because it is bothering her even though she is not wearing it? I never complain when she wears something I don't like and why should I?

AITA for not painting my nails with my mom?,"Background: last week my best friend and I hung out a lot for various reasons. One day we volunteered together, another we did a study session together, and hung out a lot besides because we have been best friends for years and like to hang out. We are both 16f.  

My best friend and I got these matching gel nail sets for Christmas. We haven’t been able to use them together yet and were going to use them together some time this week. My mom came into my room today and asked if I wanted to paint nails with her. I said no because last night my friend and I decided we wouldn’t paint our nails until we could get together this week and we would wait for each other. My mom blew up at me and called me pathetic then walked out of my room. She said I’m “obsessed” with my friend and planning every second of my life around hanging out with her.

AITA FOr using my parrot to make my brother inlaw leave me alone?,"I (male, 14) have a cute little African Gray Parrot. I also have an annoying brother inlaw named ""Steven"" (male, 26). He's married to my sister ""Alice"" (female, 26).

Steven always comes to my room to play on my Nintendo Switch with me which I didn't mind at first because it was like having an older brother but then it got a little annoying. He came to my room too much and even when I wanted to be alone I still let him because I felt bad. Well I finally got the courage a week ago to tell him that I want to play alone in my room sometimes. He says he understood but literally still kept coming. I told my sister to make him stop coming to my room so much and that it's annoying. She told me that he's just trying to be a good brother inlaw. I mean I guess I understand that but I would really like to have my privacy. 

Steven isn't scared of my parrot but he still doesn't like her or being around her. I thought I should use that to my advantage. Her habitat is the den of our house but I have a perch area for her in my room. She only comes to it if I bring her there though. My mom told me earlier today that Steven and Alice were coming over so I brought my parrot to my room and let her chill on her perch with her toys. After dinner, just as expected, Steven said he wanted to come to my room to play. I said sure and brought my parrot with me. I put her on her perch and let her play around there. Plus my room is kind of small so not much space between many of us. Steven was immediately uncomfortable and asked if I could put her outside and I told him I didn't want to because I wanted to watch over her for a little bit. He said that he didn't really like being around the bird that much so he left. I was so happy and surprised in a way that it worked. I mean I felt bad ofcourse but I really don't think I was left any other options.

They left later and Alice texted me soon after like literally 30 mins ago saying that I was rude for doing that and I should've played with him. Okay I guess I was rude but like I said before he literally never leaves me alone when he's here so I really don't think I had any other options. Admittedly I could've locked my door but I thought against it because it wasn't subtle enough. I would really like an outsiders opinion on if I'm TA in this situation or if what I did was justified. I do feel bad but at the same time I don't so anything would be appreciated please.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I picked my brother over my best friend?,"Ok this is still pretty fresh, an I’m on my phone typing this. So here we go. 
I am getting married this year (covid pending) everything was going relatively smoothly until I got a text from my brother this morning.  My best friend (and best man) was drinking last night and sent a few flirty messages to my brothers (groomsman) fiancé. Needless to say he’s pissed off. He told me he wants nothing to do with my friend now and will no longer be a groomsman. Obviously I am devastated as I want my brother and my best friend to be at my side for my big day. 
Here is some info. 
I was best man at my friends wedding. 
My friend is married with kids, has no recollection of these events.
My brothers fiancé tried to hide this from him and I think that’s made it worse. 
My friend will do anything to hide this from his wife.

Now here’s where I might be TAH.. I love my brother. He’s family. If I was to have him stay in my wedding party, I would have to drop my best friend and my friends wife would find out about what happened and probably leave him. It’s an awful position to be in. But deep down, bloods thicker than water right?
If I was to have my best friend stay as best man, my brother would not be involved and a simply can’t have that.

AITA for getting mad at my partner because the house was a mess?,"So, here is a couple of things you should know real quick. here is the whole story. no sides. because i want an honest opinion.

my partner is unemployed. he has been for about 3 months. It's not because there are no jobs (there are) but he has not wanted to do anything regarding food or clothing. he thinks they are dead-end jobs and is very upset about being caught up in one of them.

so we agreed that he would look for a better job. i agreed i could do things on my own while he looked.

i work fast food at 12 bucks an hour. for 3 months i've been paying for rent, gas, vet appointments (our cat got hurt today. i don't have enough for rent now, so i need extra shifts).  i barely make enough to pay the rent and now i'm not sure what we're going to do. rent is 800. i have about 900 bucks in the account we use to pay for everything. i'm at the point where i'm considering doing things for money that i wouldn't usually do.

today i got angry because i literally had to fold all the laundry in the dryer, sweep the entire apartment (it was literally disgusting), wash all the clothes lying about (he 'doesnt know where my clothes go' so he just leaves them on the bed, so i have to put those away too.

and despite the fact i'm doing all the cleaning, he drops the 'it's your turn to do the dishes,' so I did those too.

i'm tired and sad. our cat hurt her foot bad. she's getting stitches.

my boss at work says he's a lazy asshole who should spend more time thinking about how he's going to help rather than waiting for the 'perfect job.' last time he had a job (spirit halloween,) i had to LITERALLY drop it in his lap so that he would even consider it.

and whenever i get angry at him, he does the thing where he gets angry at ME and tries to claim i'm being an asshole and he's just 'doing his best.'

I personally believe that if he's home all day, the house should at LEAST be clean.

Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for kicking my husband out of our loft?,"I (27F) work primarily from home. My husband (31M) works in a warehouse. Because I work from home, and we live in a loft (above his parents house. This matters), there is VERY limited space for me to set up my work equipment (laptop, dual monitors, desk) and be comfortable and also not have too much noise interference because I work for a call center taking live calls. My schedule is normally M-F but I started picking up OT hours on my days off because we are saving up to buy a house.

So today, I woke up a few hours before I was scheduled to start my OT shift. I gently reminded my husband ""hey I know you're tired from work, but I'm going to be doing OT today. If you would like to keep sleeping, just please go downstairs and sleep in your parents house so my callers won't hear you in the background."" He agreed and said he would go downstairs, but he fell asleep before he moved. So an hour passes and I gently remind him again, ""I'm starting work soon. Please go downstairs."" He again agreed to move, but fell back asleep.

Now I'm currently ON THE PHONES trying to take calls (obviously typing this in my downtime) and he is still in the room sleeping. EVERYTIME I say ""Babe, you are snoring. PLEASE go downstairs."" He says he will either go down or just wake up since I'm up and working but so far, neither have happened. 

Here is where I might be the AH. After taking a few calls and getting frustrated that I have had to ask multiple times for him to just go downstairs, I yelled "" (NAME) CAN YOU PLEASE GO THE FUCK DOWNSTAIRS!!!"" Now he's acting like I'm being this massive bitch and that he has to walk on eggshells to not upset me. Maybe I shouldn't have yelled but it's not like I didn't have a reason and just yelled at him out of nowhere.

So Reddit, AITA??


EDIT: For those of you commenting about him being a sleep zombie, trust me I get it. I JUST walked over to him, and woke him up and said ""let's get you downstairs."" He GOT UP, told me ""ok I'm going now"", looked around for his phone (idk why he needs it but I'm on break so I even helped him look). He located his phone and then laid back down and fell back asleep. So what now??

UPDATE: My OT has come to an end (I never was able to get him up and downstairs...). As SOON as I got off the phone, he wakes up and goes outside to have a cigarette. I suggested he make an appointment for a sleep study (thanks to many of you) and explained basically what happened with me trying to wake him. He said ""yeah, I remember that""....??


LAST AND FINAL UPDATE: Because I really want to end this now.

1. We discussed as a couple that I would work OT since my job offers it and his does not. He knew about the OT as soon as I signed up for it (2 days prior), the day before, the day of, and 2 hours before I was scheduled to start. Not like I sprung it on him out of nowhere.

2. Why couldn't I just move?? THERE IS NO SPACE TO ACCOMMODATE MY SET UP BESIDES WHERE IT IS. And even if there WAS, I would be doing more harm by being in the living room because then I would be disturbing my in-laws in addition to my husband. Hence why I asked HIM to move so everybody could sleep in peace downstairs while I worked upstairs. Win-win for everyone. He gets to keep sleeping (or not. I don't care. He's a grown ass man. What he does with HIS time on HIS days off is up to him) I can work.

3. I have a work provided headset. It does not noise cancel and CLEARLY picks up more than I wished it would because callers were telling me they heard him. Not a big deal if it was ONCE but since he is actively trying to sleep with possible sleep apnea (more than likely since it sounds like heavy machinery like another user pointed out) it is occurring OFTEN. I can excuse it once, not 15 times on one call.

4. To the ""yelling is abuse"" crowd. I have been abused. Mentally, physically, and psychologically. I'm in therapy now for that abuse. Me raising my voice to wake my sleeping husband who either could not hear me or CHOSE not to hear me, is not abuse. So please chill out with yalls holier than thou attitude. I'm so glad yalls relationships are perfect and you never have ANY reason to yell (like NEVER?? Honestly and truly??) but to wake a sleeping person who is not responding to ""gentle tactics"", to yell is not over the top.

5. To the ""there is no need to curse"" crowd. I'm not 5.",Not the A-hole
AITA For keeping our marriage a secret from our inlaws for a month?,"AITA? We kept our marriage a secret from our inlaws for a month.
A few years back, husband and I decided to finally get married. We had been together for over a decade, and since we wanted to eventually get a house,ect it just made sense to finally do it.
We got married by a justice of the peace and invited no one from either side. We didn't want a wedding, as were saving for a house anyway, and because both sets of our parents are deceased.
Husbands mother had just died of cancer a few months before we got married, and we wanted to have at least a little joy in our lives by getting married, and we had fun picking our (reasonably)priced rings and nice clothes for our little wedding day. 
I really wanted to tell my sister in law (SIL) But my husband wanted to wait to tell them in person, at his moms ashes ceremony/ dinner that was planned for the following month. He wanted some good news to share on a day that would have plenty of sadness already. So I respected his wishes, and when SIL and I talked on phone prior to the ashes ceremony day, I kept it a secret from her.
The day finally comes to pour his moms ashes into the ocean. We meet up for a family dinner first, and some aunts, uncles and cousins are there. After eating, we share our nice news, most everyone seemed happy and congratulated us,welcomed me into the family, but SIL seemed slightly upset, and asked several times why we didn't tell her on the phone. We told her a few times we just wanted some good news to share on a day with a lot of sadness to it, and we just thought it would be nice to tell the family in person. We explained we had no real wedding, just a justice of the peace. After dinner we go to a secluded part of the beach, and poured his moms ashes into the ocean. Lost of sadness and tears, but somehow peaceful as the ocean mixed her ashes with the sand. 
I thought that was the end of it with SIL but I was wrong.
We had rented an ocean cabin to stay in, as many of us traveled to get to the beach. So next morning we have breakfast with just me, husband, his brother, wife ( my SIL) and their kids, and the husbands uncle and aunt. 
As were eating, my now SIL turns to me, visibly upset, and began to berate me about keeping our marriage a secret, that it hurt her feelings to not be told about it right away, and she cant believe I would do that to her, keep secrets about something so important. she was angry  that she and her family ware not invited to wedding. I explained several times, we had a justice of the peace, no one came,and we wanted some nice news to share. She kept repeating how hurtful it was, kept going on and on about it, till I got mad and told her she was the one being rude about this, not me. It caused a lot of tension, everyone was uncomfortable, and we barely talk now. 

So people of Reddit, am i an asshole for keeping our marriage a secret for a month?I

EDIT.....the announcement was made at the dinner earlier in the day, but i should have explained that part better. I waited to see the mood before i said anything...Everyone at the dinner was actually upbeat, happy, sharing nice memories, discussing happy stuff, like kids going to colleges, promotions, retirements, vacations, ect so then I shared it....i can see how my lack of details makes our timing sound shitty tho....but everyone was in good spirits considering everything going on.
Also..I should have mentioned that at the breakfast I did tell her I was sorry if keeping this from her hurt her feelings, I had apologized several times in that conversation, before i got pissy back with her about it)So
Also, she is husbands sister in law, not his sister, its his bio brothers wife, His brother wasnt mad either, if this matters..",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my stepsister she can’t keep using the death of her mother as an excuse for everything?,"So i (F18) live with my brother (M19), my mom, her husband, and his daughter (f18). 

My step sister’s mom passed away during childbirth. From what i’ve been told, she never had a mother figure in her life. I felt for her, i really did. But around 16, it got really old when she got away with shit because she used the death of her mom as an excuse. My mom remarried when i was 13 btw

It turned from small things she got away with to larger things. For instance, when we were 14, she completely trashed my room after she lost in a game of uno. Everything in my room from posters to my bed sheets were ruined. Her dad gave me $10 and said i shouldn’t take it to heart because she was upset from not having a mother figure. 

Another one, my brother got his first car at 17 and she wanted him to take her to see friends, go shopping, just treat him like a personal uber. He said no so she scratched it up with a something and it was ruined. Again, my mom and her dad said “she’s just not in the right mindset because she misses her mom”. 

Today, my brother and i were going to see my dad for his birthday. We made a cake for him and got him a custom blanket with a picture of his dog who passed a few weeks ago. As we’re getting ready to go, my step sister complained to her dad about us getting to “leave out” during the pandemic but she’s not allowed to see her friends. 

We told her we were only going to see my dad and coming back and it was just the three of us not a large group of friends. She got mad and stormed off and we didn’t think much of it. It was stupid of me but i left the blanket downstairs not thinking much about it and when i went back down, it had bleach on it and the cake was sort of smashed by a ketchup bottle in the fridge.(even tho it had a top over it)

I already knew it was her and asked wtf was wrong with her. Both my brother and i were upset and it just turned into a screaming match. My mom came down to see what was happening and she started fake crying and said “it hurts seeing them get to visit their dad but i can’t visit my mom, i miss her so much it’s not fair”. Surprisingly enough my mom got upset with her but her dad came in and told us it wasn’t a big deal and we could just get a new one he continued with ‘she just misses her mom a lot, cut her some slack’

I finally lost it and told her she can’t keep using the death of her mom because it was not a valid excuse. I kinda got into detail how she was just being a bitch and i was not letting this slide. She stormed off crying (as usual) and her dad wants me to apologize because “i’d never understand the pain of losing a parent”. I said i wasn’t apologizing and my brother stood by my side.  Aita?

EDIT- 

Woah. Wow. I did not expect this many replies. Firstly thanks to everyone for the suggestions especially the petty ones haha. So, my step sister doesn’t see a therapist because her dad doesn’t “believe in shrinks”. I see a therapist and told him it helped me and it could help her but he refused. And i’m no professional so i can’t speak about if she’s got something wrong mentally 

I have had several talks with my mom and her husband about how my step sister is, especially when they aren’t around, and they always say it’s no big deal. As a lot of you stated already, my brother has said how could she miss her mom when she didn’t even know her and he was grounded for a month so i knew better than to say that. 

I think i will get the authorities involved because i have pictures of the blanket and her admitting to doing it and “not caring”. I’m gonna give her dad a chance to pay for it but if he doesn’t i’m going to go about doing that. I’m already sure he’s not going to pay for it because it was super expensive. 

My brother and i initially stayed because there was no issues until yesterday. I think i speak for both of us when i say i’ve had enough. My dad found out what happened and he got mad at my mom and now my mom is mad at me for telling my dad sorta like a chain reaction haha. 

I think i’ve covered all of the questions but if i didn’t let me know !",Not the A-hole
AITA? Mom freaks out over low grades,"Hello!

AITA for not wanting to watch or hold other people’s babies?,"Hello all,

I saw the post about the girl who got mad that her BIL would not hold her baby, and was surprised at the YTA responses (because she made him hold the baby even though he refused). 

I (24f) am the BIL in this situation, and I thought I was an asshole for this so I’m looking for other people’s judgements. 

I’m married to my husband who has a little niece and nephew. They are very cute, but I honestly don’t get the hype. Everyone acts like they are the most precious thing in the world. To me, they are 60% cute, 40% annoying. 

I have this thing where I do not like to watch them and I also keep interactions to a minimum. If they come to me, I won’t be rude and will go along with it, but like I said, I refuse to watch them or anything like that. 

My in laws, so the kids grandparents, don’t like this about me. My niece’s birthday was a few days ago and while we were celebrating her mom asked me to watch her play in the pool while she went to tend to nephew. 

I kind of panicked and told her no, to call someone else to do it. I don’t feel comfortable watching her especially in a pool where things can go south real quick. I don’t want any of that responsibility and that’s why I’m child free. 

She kind of made a face and took niece with her while niece started crying because she didn’t want to leave the pool. 

Everyone thinks I’m an asshole. But I CHOOSE not to have kids and I don’t feel like I should be made to watch other people’s... I don’t care if it’s for a minute, just please watch your own kid. 

So, AITA?

Edit: I wanted to make an edit because I didn’t think this post would blow up and to address a few things. The baby I was going to watch is only a year old. The mom wanted me to get in the pool and hold and entertain her. She was fuzzy and struggling due to her mom leaving. So, I wasn’t just watching a baby, I had to literally hold her so she wouldn’t drown. Have you all been in a pool and choked on a bit of water and almost died? I have. I know he’s worst case scenario and everything, but I wanted no part in it. 

Also, I understand this situation is very different from the other post I referenced, so I never meant to be insensitive by comparing it. It just gave me the idea to post my own. 

After seeing everyone’s response (I really thought people would say I’m an asshole, and some of you did) I’m confident that I made the right choice and I will continue to hold my ground. As I mentioned in a couple of comments, I know that once the kids start getting older, I’ll be more comfortable being around them and maybe even watching them for short periods of time.

This money was put aside to help my (25M) brother and I through school, and I have been paying all of my living expenses since moving out at 18. I have not asked for any money from her other than the RESP, which she has always given me readily, until now.

I am about to finish my undergrad and, though I have applied to a masters, I don’t know if I am accepted yet, so I have a plan to try to best to deal with the money. Simply put, a RESP in Canada (where I am), is part of a government program that will match whatever funds you put in. Currently, we are now only working through the money that the government put in. None the current balance previously belonged to my mom. It is all new money.

Noteworthy as well is that RESPs aren’t just intended for tuition, but also for living expenses. Therefore, the money wasn’t just intended to go towards debt, but also to set us up to survive while in school/right after. My brother dropped out of school a few years ago and doesn’t currently have any plans to go back, but to give him a bit of a nest egg and to make things simple if he does decide to go back later, I suggested that we split the remainder of the money after my debt is paid. Given that the money was always described to us as our money that our mom was simply holding, he was all for it.

Today I called my mom and suggested a plan to take the money out and split it between my brother and me. She accused me of going behind her back by talking to my brother about the money. I don’t agree, as this money was always intended to go to my brother and me, and the call didn’t involve any conspiracy or anything. I was basically just giving him a heads up that money could be coming his way soon.

On this call she said that she didn’t see the money as my brother’s or mine, but as hers because it was her account and she wanted to keep some of it for herself to pay off her own debt. She has several other accounts and investments in her name and has generally been very good at managing her money. That being said, she is a homeowner, and is in a significant amount of debt. Don’t get me wrong, I want to see my mom out of debt, but this money was never intended to go to her, and I don’t think I should feel guilty for wanting the money that I was told from childhood would be accessible to me.

If/when I begin my masters, I will be moving to Toronto and my expenses will essentially double, meaning that I will have more need for the money. As well, I have a lung condition, so working during COVID is not really a possibility for me. My plan for the money was to set some aside for savings, but use the bulk for my newly increased living expenses.

AITA for calling animal control because people let their dogs run off leash at a park where I go running?,"I love running, but I get shin splints when I run on concrete, so I try to stick to trails. There's only one good park that has natural running trails and it's a popular place for people to walk their dog. It is explicitly against park rules to have dogs off leash at this park and there is a very large sign when you enter the park that sates their rules, including that doges must be on a leash. EVERY TIME I go running at this park I see people walking with their dogs off leash and I've been chased by a dog more than once while trying to run. I went running yesterday and saw 8 dogs off leash during that run. I've tried to politely mention it to people a few times and they've always been very rude to me about it. I put up with it for months and then finally called the police non-emergency number to see if there was anything I could do. They informed me that it is illegal for their dogs to be off leash in that park and referred me to animal control. I've called them and they are now regularly patrolling that area. I've told two people about this and they both think I'm being a ""Karen"" for reporting it. My sister apparently used to let her dog run off leash there too and doesn't think there's anything wrong with it. I know that it's the law for dogs to be on a leash there, but am I being an asshole for reporting it? Do you think I'm over reacting? We don't really have a good dog park in my town, so that's probably part of the problem... But I also don't get why they can't just walk them on a leash???

Edit: Thanks for the feedback guys! I was getting a lot of negativity from people about it and it was making me feel bad. Thanks for reminding me that I did the right thing and that it's in everyone's best interest to follow the rules. You guys made some really good points and I feel much better about my decision now. :)",Not the A-hole
AITA for making baked goods for my boyfriend and his family?,"Let's start off like this: one year ago I've been at a very low point due to school, covid, my parents, the whole package. I've started baking more frequently and I absolutely love it. I'll make anything I can get my mind to and it makes me very happy. I love the process of it, it's very calming especially with music in the background, and my results seem to be pretty nice.
Now I bake a lot during special occasions mostly, and sometimes randomly for my friends. The fact that I'm able to make something that tastes good and see it in their reactions makes me feel very happy.
I love to also bake for my boyfriend and his family. He says he loves the muffins I make for him and whenever I'd make him something when we still went to school, he would eat it as breakfast.  Of course I also bake for my own family, they seem to give more constructive criticism which I'm always open to. But all in all, I bake 50/50 for both of our families, or whatever I make, I give half of that to my boyfriend's family and everyone is happy, or are they?
Well my family seems to have an issue with this, I can't tell why exactly. Whenever I say that I'll give some of what I make to my boyfriend, they get weird.
""Oh c'mon OP, you'll take all of that and leave us with nothing?"" Now mind you, I make sure to split 50/50, maybe one or 2± portions to keep the numbers right. Recently, I made an entire cheesecake for my family, and plenty of sugar cookies for my boyfriend's family. I even left some of the cookies at home, as I couldn't transport them all. My mother got mad at me for this. I can't tell why she was unsatisfied with a whole cheesecake, a strawberry cheesecake at that, which is her favourite. I spent my monthly allowance on most of the ingredients for both things I made. She didn't seem to be one bit appreciative, and when I told her that the bulk of the cookies would go to my boyfriend's, all she could say was ""and nothing for us?"" She does this nearly every time I make something where the majority goes to my boyfriend's. I made him his favourite muffins for our first anniversary, and my mother got mad about this. I baked something for my birthday, can't remember what exactly, and because I spent it with my boyfriend, she got mad that most of the stuff went to him. I never say anything to her, sometimes I ignore her when she complains. It gets on my nerves because I can't thoroughly enjoy my hobby because of her snarky comments.
AITA for this? She doesn't lash out but always makes me feel bad whenever I give my boyfriend's family baked goods. Please keep in mind that I choose to bake, and always ask opinions on what I should make and work off of that.

AITA for moving out?,"For context I have been living with 2 roommates who are married and we have been renting this place for about a year and a half. However, for the past 6-7 months we have not been on a lease and just been paying month to month. The landlord opted not to give us a lease and just said that if we keep paying rent there isn’t an issue. 

Now my partner and I are ready to move in together because of certain problems with our respective living situations and we both feel we are ready to move in together anyway.

I told my roommates that I plan on moving out in April (even though our “lease” would be finished in July and remember we aren’t on an actual lease). When I told them they started to aggressive saying things like “Well are you gonna pay rent here through July” and “If you leave we can’t afford to live here.” Ever since I told them they have been passive aggressive and dismissive of me.

AITA for asking my girlfriend to throw out her ex's things?,"I  (30M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (29F) for 18 months. Things are starting to get serious where we have discussed the possibility of me moving into her house. Prior to me, she was in a serious relationship for 9 years with her teenaged sweetheart, together they had four kids now aged 10, 8 year twins and a 5 year old. Sadly their dad passed away three years ago from cancer. 

Now, I've met her kids, I've stayed the night at their home, she's asked me to watch them here and there so she could run errands or do her weekly hourly driving lesson (prior to the UK's third lockdown). Her kids are great. We go on family day outs together and I feel that they have accepted me and I am growing to love them a lot. However, there is something that I find very uncomfortable. She still has a lot of her ex's things laying around. 

She has a framed poster of his favourite football team hanging on her bedroom wall and she hates football. She has pictures of him and her and their kids hanging on her walls in her hallways and her lounge. She has his t-shirts folded in a box in her wardrobe. The other day I found a half empty bottle of men's shower gel at the back of her bathroom cupboard and it isn't a brand I like to use. 

When I asked my girlfriend why she still has all his stuff in the house she got a bit defensive. She stated that having the pictures hanging up reminds her kids and her of their times together before they lost him. Having his clothes in a box is purely so the kids can smell his scent if they miss their dad and they can hug a shirt instead. I told her it made me very uncomfortable having all these little reminders of a dead man in my face and if I were to move in with her then I would need all the stuff gone. She got upset, started crying and said that she couldn't just erase those parts of her life and the home she has with the kids was her home with him.

But here's where I may be the arsehole: I got a bit irritated with her and said that I don't feel like she is willing to compromise and consider my feelings. That I felt that she was comparing me to a ghost and that she might not truly love me by not considering it. She hasn't spoken to me properly in three days.

AITA for buying my GF a present?,"I (26M) and my GF (26F) decided this year to not buy each other birthday presents as we are trying to save money and also due to the pandemic. My birthday came along and we did have a nice dinner that night, but as I said, we weren't doing presents. I recently got a bonus from my employer, which happened pretty close to her birthday. Due to the bonus, I decided to get her a present without discussing it with her first. It wasnt too expensive, but was still a nice gift. She didnt say anything negative immediately, but later that night I asked her what was wrong as I could feel something was off, she said that she felt bad for the fact that she hadn't got me anything and yet I got her a present. I reassured her that she did nothing wrong as we had agreed not to do presents. I can see where she is coming from, but some of her friends think that it was a dick move to buy her a present without consulting her first. Aita?",Asshole
AITA for greeting my ex a happy birthday?,"My ex broke up with me after having to go back home way far away from where she lived when Covid got really serious. This was totally understandable, and I never begrudged them for the decision they made for themselves. 

We didn't communicate all that much afterwards as it was still a little awkward for me to get over the whole incident. 

Fast forward to their birthday which was about two months later and I decided to shoot them a happy birthday message as I knew they liked being greeted on their bday and I genuinely wanted to brighten their day up, and they tell me to never message them again before blocking me everywhere.

It's been a little under two months since then, and I still find myself angry, confused, and honestly very hurt. Its especially painful because we promised each other we'd still try our best to be friends if we broke up while we were still a thing.

I'm just entirely bewildered if it was because of something I said. Was sending them a birthday message a dick move on my end that I'm just not aware of? Either way, I'm certain I'm never gonna get any real closure on this so I figured I'd feel better if I just shouted into the void",Not the A-hole
"AITA for getting a ""friend"" fired from our job?","Obviously jobs are come by in the pandemic. This friend(who we'll call Betty), myself, and two other mutual friends(Aaron and Ophelia) were all laid off from this job in June due to COVID. I was lucky enough to be rehired in July. In November, Betty, Aaron, and Ophelia all had the chance to reapply for their old jobs. Betty begged that Ophelia and Aaron help her with the creative exercise but they both refused. Betty basically extorted her roommate until doing the creative for her since roommate obviously wanted to stop covering all the bills.

Betty got her job back in December, but Aaron and Ophelia missed out.

Day 4 of Betty being rehired, she posts on Facebook, ""Well, I'm shadowing for a job I already know so I'm basically fucking off and playing video games instead lol"" She's friends with Aaron, Ophelia, and OUR MUTUAL MANAGER on Facebook. I take a screenshot and send it to our manager with the intent of him talking to her and telling her that is disrespectful/uncool. Manager acknowledges that I sent it to him and I don't expect to hear anything back since disciplinary actions are always pretty hush hush. 

A few weeks later, Manager says in our 1 on 1, ""I can't tell you anything specific obviously, but I just want to let you know that the screenshot you sent me was addressed. I just want to make sure you know it wasn't ignored and thanks for pointing it out.""

Cut to this Friday, about a half hour before end of day an email is sent from my manager's manager saying: Betty and another employee no longer work with the company, effective immediately.

From Ophelia playing sympathetic, we were able to discern that the screenshot/her post are what got Betty fired.

I know she dug her own grave by making the post and our manager might have seen it without me sending a screenshot but I still feel a little guilty. Should I have minded my own damn business?

AITA for telling my mom we haven’t had a good relationship in a long time and I wanted to go live with my dad?,"I (16F) used to have a good relationship with my mother. That has since crashed and burned since she dated and married my stepdad “Gary” six years ago. Gary treats his son “Ian” (19M) like he’s the center of the universe and expects my mother to as well, so she does. Anything Ian wants, Ian gets and that usually comes at the expense of me. Ian wanted my room when they moved it? I was forced to go to another room to “make the transition easier for everyone.” Ian wanted a car for his 16th birthday? I didn’t get braces for another year. Ian wanted to go on an expensive trip for Spring Break? I had to give up Volleyball to make it happen. Ian wanted to have his side of the family over? I was expected to find somewhere else to be, since I wasn’t family. My mother just went along with all of this and acted like it shouldn’t affect me at all.

My dad was overseas for a long time, and we used to FaceTime and he was so upset by what he was hearing. He’s home now and he’s offering to have me come live with him. I’m not seeing a reason not to go, and so I told my mom I wanted to go live with my dad. She predictably freaked out and asked why I’d want to do that and said that we had such a good relationship, she didn’t understand how this came so out of the blue. I told her that we haven’t had a good relationship since she blindly decided to follow Gary’s lead and give Ian anything he wanted, and it always came at my expense. My mom tried to argue so I said, I also wanted to leave because she let them kick me out of my own house because ”I wasn’t family” so I was going to go live with someone who was. My mom started crying and said she wouldn’t let me go, so I told her that my dad was willing to go to court over it and I was old enough to be able to say where I wanted to be. 

She’s been a crying mess since I told her, and Gary is being a jackass about how awful I’m being.  Here’s where I might be the asshole. He was bitching at me about how terribly I’m treating them and how I’m not thinking about them at all. I asked why should I, he never thought of me when he was taking things from me to give to his kid. I said let’s face facts here, you don’t care about me, what you care about is losing the child support you spend on your son. He sort of went slack jawed and I walked off. My dad said my mom called and threatened to take him to court, so he said he’d see her there. Now she’s panicking because she realized he is planning on taking her to court over this. Mom and Gary of course think I’m the asshole for “making things hard” for everyone, but my dad and grandparents say to leave and never look back.

AITA for being shocked that my friend will get married before me?,"I have this friend, let's call her Jane. We're in our mid-thirties now but we were roommates since freshman year in college. She's one of my closest friends and I know her super well. And I know that for all of her twenties, she had horrendous luck with her love life and was extremely insecure about it. She always wanted to get married and have kids and kept ending up with douchebags who would cheat on her, or man who straight up didn't like her (daddy issues) and crying about it... and I was always there for her through it and reassuring her how she won't die alone. But her love life kinda became a punchline in our group of friends and sometimes she'd go along with it, especially once she got into her 30s and was still single. She'd say like ""haha yeah guys we all know I'm gonna die alone"" all the time and I know she was torn up about it, but we were always reassuring her that its not the case and she was in therapy about it. 

Anyways, about a year ago she finally met an incredible man and they fell in love almost instantly. He proposed to her last week and she's just completely over the moon, I've never seen her this happy. This weekend we all went out to celebrate and all our friends were saying how we're so happy for her after a long and difficult road, and it was really emotional. For context, I'm still single, no boyfriend, and I want to get married too (but I'm not a pathology like she was) and so I said ""I can't believe JANE will get married before me!"" 

She started crying and stormed out and the evening was completely spoiled. I tried calling her this weekend but she was hysterical and said that I didn't have to point out that she's so unlovable and its a miracle she tricked someone into proposing. Its quite sad... but that's not what I meant... that's her own baggage. I apologized but also suggested she should talk to her therapist about that reaction and now she completely refuses to speak to me and won't answer my messages. A couple others in our friend group are on her side, while some have said that she's overreacting and will come around.

AITA for telling my step-dad and mom that they shouldn't be surprised at what my little brother said to them when they pulled a prank on him?,"I \[20 F\] am an older sister to my little (biological) brother (17 M) who finished high school last year. My little brother and I are really close. He says I'm the best friend he has and he loves me more than anyone (of course this is not true, he has many friends of his own).

My brother has been asking our step-dad/mother if he could get a new car for his grad party since last year, and he said he'd pay 50-75% with his own hard-earned money while they paid the rest. They said no. I have a car but I had been working for one, they helped me pay off for it. So my brother's arguments with our parents got heated after awhile (one time I told my brother that I'd help him pay off expenses for a good car once I got my own. He hugged me and said I didn't need to worry and that he owed me way more than I owed him). But he continued to press our parents all of last year until they gave in and said yes like they did for me.

Note that our step-dad and my brother have a negative relationship for the most part. Our bio mother and step-dad got together soon after our bio dad and mom divorced when we were little. My brother thinks that step-dad and mother were seeing each other before our real parents divorced and tbh, I think that might be true. Not certain, though.

Anyway, my step-dad, mother and brother compromised and said they'd get him the car in 2021 so that people don't gawk at him at the graduation party. June this year my brother and step-dad/mother are still on about the car, now the arguments getting loud and lasting hours until evening. My step-dad was getting into screaming matches with my brother over it but they reached a final compromise of the car being bought last week. 

The fated morning comes and my brother wakes up to our step-dad and mom guiding him outside to... a car. But not his, our mother's. Step-dad used his and my brother's money on a dumb prank, bought a completely different model of car, and said it was for our mother. Our mom and step dad just laughed and kissed each other. My brother didn't lose it, he didn't even look angry. He just looked dead in our step-dad's eyes and said, and I'm not joking, verbatim: ""you might think I'm fucking stupid, you might think whatever. But I'm just better than you, bro. You know that, I know that, and our mom is a fucking idiot for staying with a prick like you. But I'll make you wish you'd never fucking met us. I promise you. You might be laughing now, but you'll be crying later."" He then walked off, not even looking back at them as they stared horrified.

They asked me what was that about and I, feeling terrible for my brother, said they had it coming and not to be surprised. So now they grounded both of us. I've had to explain the situation to my friends as I can't see them anymore but I feel so bad for my baby brother and they back me up on this and ask me to comfort him as much as possible. But our parents are so mad, and they can't see that my brother had his heart crushed. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to babysit my kids half sibling?,"Two years ago I found out my ex cheated. He was trying to win me back after I kicked him out but stopped when he found out his other woman was pregnant. They got married and now have a daughter together who just turned 1. Ex and I have two kids together 14m and 13f. The kids are primarily with me because ex lives 3 hours from the kids school. They see him every other weekend, extended weeks in summer and alternating holidays. He and I are civil around the kids but I ignore any and all communication with him outside of that, and he has tried to communicate with me. So has his wife but I ignore her completely and I refuse any communication with her after she called me a c\*\*\* for saying no to sharing mothers day with her the first year of their relationship being official.

The kids know dad cheated because of their ages and the fact he left our home and moved in with her within a couple of weeks. I told them they don't need to hate dad for me, and put them in therapy, but they have a very strained relationship with him because of his actions. Our breakup has been so hard on them and I feel horrible that I can't make it better for them.

I say all this to provide context for the situation. Ex sent me a text Sunday afternoon asking me to watch his daughter overnight because he and his wife had a family emergency they needed to deal with and the babysitter didn't pick up. I sent a simple reply of no and didn't respond after that. Turns out her father was dying in the hospital and ex wasn't there with her because the hospital don't allow visitors under 16 since Covid. He has blown up my phone every day since. I'm still ignoring it. Part of me questions if I was TA though.

Aita for only going to black salons,"Hi there, this is my first post and this is a throw away. I am a 30 year old white woman with thick curly brown hair (3c if you know what that means).  I have always struggled with my hair and was adopted into a family of people with straight hair who couldnt care for my hair properly leading to huge knots and regularly get my hair massacred by scissors to make it short to be easier to deal with.

When i went to uni i met my best friend who is black and has a similar hair type to me and when noticing my struggle helped me out. She showed me hair products from brands intended for black people that really helped with my hair quality and even took me to the salon she went to that catered for black hair types. My hair has been amazing ever since, theyve been the only people to understand how to care for my hair and make it look nice. 

Well onto the actual argument, me and some friends from work went out for dinner and we were talking about our hair and i commented that i go to a salon that specialises in black haircare. One of the women ( also white) commented that it was inappropriate for me as a white woman to take advantage of black products and services that should only be used by black people. When i asked why she said that its kind of cultural appropriation. The others there agreed with her and i felt uncomfortable ever since.

WIBTA for taking someone to small claims court for vet bills + car damage for trying to save my dog who didn't need saving?,"**Edit:** Hopefully this doesn't get this thread banned. This seems to be coming up a lot in responses, I do not contest that the dude had a justifiable concern when it came to breaking a window of my car. The bone of contention is whether his good intentions balance out lacerating all four of my dogs feet because he smashed the window all over my dog and then left my dog in the car with broken glass all over the place. (He's 35lbs and had a leash and harness on.)

I'm in the waiting room at the pet ER right now waiting for my dog to get window glass taken out of his feet and I'm honestly so furious I'm amazed I can spell.

Earlier today I took my dog to the dog park, as one does when one has a dog and wants a moment's peace during the day. It's about 80F here, but humid so my dog ran around a bit then kinda flopped over in the shade. Since he'd done the shadeflop I hooked him up and we went to leave. We got to the car and I realized I had left his water bottle in the park.

Now, the parking lot for the dog park is shared by a bunch of different things and has had a recent problem with car break-ins and I am not aware of a way to lock my car doors while the car is running. So I figured, it's two minutes, the car is parked in the shade, I'll just put him in, lock the doors, and run to grab the bottle. When I left him he was alert, sitting up, and panting like the dickens because he was running around on a hot summer day.

Just as I grabbed the water bottle I heard glass smash, which was weird, so I hustled back to my car and found some guy leaning into my car through my freshly broken window. Conversation is approximately as follows:

Me: ""What the actual fuck do you think you're doing?!""

Random dude emerges from my car with a tiny plastic water bottle and a tire iron, ""You locked your dog in the car on a hot day, look at how he's panting!""

Me: ""I was gone for two minutes, the car is parked in the shade, and the dog is panting because WE'RE LEAVING THE FUCKING DOG PARK!""

It was at this point my dog started making big yipe sounds and I shove the dude away from my car and take a look. Rather than think about what he's doing and break the window so the glass falls down, this guy had just gone full send with his tire iron and sprayed the entire backseat in shards of broken glass, which my stressed out dog was pacing back and forth over.

In all the hullabaloo with people trying to figure out what's going on and me doing my best to figure out how to ease my dog's pain, this guy has realizes he made a rather massive oopsie and tries to just sneak into his truck and leave. So while I'm cradling my dog so he's not putting weight on his glass impregnated feet I plant myself behind his truck so the random dude can't leave, and ask a dog park friend with free hands to call the police. Dude had the stones to actually say ""What the fuck man I was trying to help.""

Police came and took a report, got everyone's information and I was told this was a civil matter and should probably be handled in small claims court.

If the guy had JUST broken my window I most likely would've chalked it up to good intentions gone wrong and eaten the cost of replacing the window myself. This is not just a broken window however, this is also my dog getting hurt pretty badly and I don't feel like this is a thing I can let slide.

AITA for saying my mom named me like a madlibs?,"My first name, Waverly, is the street my mom grew up on. My middle name is where I was conceived. My last name is a noun. It feels like a madlib. I’ve never felt any strong way towards my name other than wishing I had a “girlier” name when I was a kid, but I’ve always felt a little frustrated at the fact that my mom named me like one of those security question scams on Facebook. My siblings all were named a bit more normally.

Anyways, my sister is pregnant and didn’t want a baby shower, so we had a nice dinner for her, 3 days ago, instead. We got onto the topic of names and my family starts giving their input and I tell her, “You could always take mom’s approach and just do a madlib.” My sister laughs and my mom throws herself on the table and bursts into tears. She starts wailing about how she didn’t know I hated my name so much, how awful she is as a parent, how I should just change my name and be done with her. My siblings and I console her, or try to, and after like 20 minutes with no success, my sister tells me I should leave so I don’t upset her anymore.

My boyfriend (together 3 yrs) is fuming the whole way home, saying I knew that would upset her and I put him in an awkward spot. He’s been frustrated with me since. My sister also says I did it on purpose to upset her (we’ve always had a rocky relationship) and that I ruined her dinner because I was jealous of her for having a baby (I’m not) My other siblings have stayed mostly out of it but told me to apologize to our mom, which I did. I called and told her how sorry I was and rhat I really did like my name, and she starts saying I don’t need to lie to “spare an old woman’s feelings” and that she should be apologizing to me for “saddling me with such a burden.” I tried some more but she just kept wallowing. Ever since, she’s been making 3-4 Facebook posts PER DAY about how she’s a bad mom and grateful that her children still love her despite all her failures. My family has started reaching out trying to be sure everything hs okay. 

I didn’t mean to say it maliciously. I genuinely harbor no ill will towards my mother. I feel like everything has spiraled out of control and I feel like this is some weird revenge thing she’s trying to do. But was I actually mean enough to deserve the revenge? Was I really that out of line?

AITA for refusing to return my friend’s dog?,"My friend left Maryland for England and left his dog(Venus) to me. Originally he left temporarily and asked me to take her in for a few months but he called me up and told me he wasn’t going to be able to bring her as he couldn’t find a dog friendly place and that I could keep her if I wanted. I told her I’d be glad to and that was that. She’s been with me for 2.5 years now and she is so gentle and calm. She never barks and is the best hiking buddy ever and my gf adores her. 

My friend called me and asked for her back. They found a new place that allow dogs and are finally settled enough to get her back and asked me to help ship her. I said he told me she was mine and he said yes and that it was because of his housing circumstances that he couldn’t control and that his son really misses her. He offered to pay me $2000 for her but I don’t want to give and told him so. He wasn’t happy and hung up.",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to pay for my niece and nephew's college?,"So I (28f) have been married t my husband john (38m) for the last 4 years. John comes from a very rich family whereas I come from a very poor family. From the moment I introduced John to my Parents and sibling (43f ally,38m Anthony, and 37m bill ) my sister has made snide comments about how I am a kept woman, how I looked for a man to take care of me, and how I am basically a sugar baby. None of that is true, I have a very high-paying job and honestly, I didn't even know John was rich for the first few months we were dating because he lives a very laid back normal life. He told me about his wealth when he asked me to meet his parents because he didn't want me to be caught off guard when meeting them.

I cut contact with an ally not long after john proposed to me because she started sending nudes to john, telling him to leave me for her, etc. There was a big fight when he turned her down, she called him a cradle robber and some other less than pleasant things. This was 4 years ago.

Fast forward to a two weeks ago when i got a call from my mom asking me to come to dinner at her house. I thought nothing of it and John and I went. Imagine my surprise when my sister and her kids (18m and 18f) showed not long after. John and I wanted to leave then and there but my mom begged us to stay and listen so we did.

Apparently, Anthony and bill had let it slip that I had helped them out with paying tuition for my 2 nephews and niece. Because of this Ally asked me if I was willing to help her pay for her kids too. When she asked me this I was stunned because I know that the twin's late father had left enough money for them to attend college. When I asked her about that money she said she had to spend half of it to pay bills the last 2 years because the pandemic hit them hard when she lost her job.

I told her this was sad but I am not helping her pay for their tuition because 1. we haven't spoken in 4 years, 2. she has been nasty to me my entire life, and 3 she hasn't even apologized for what she did to me. She said all that was in the past and that I should just move on. This made me even angrier and I just left without saying anything else to her.

My mom has been calling me every day since asking me to just give them the money because I can afford it. Anthony and Bill apologized for telling her what I did for them and said they will support any decision I make. My sister posted online about how I was being a greedy aunt who refuses to help her less wealthy family and I have been getting some hate from people. Some of the ally's friends even called to tell me I was being petty. My husband even though he is angry and embarrassed by this situation said he will support me no matter what decision I make.

I kinda feel like an asshole in this whole situation because I could help my sister out with the tuition but i am just refusing to because of how she has treated me my entire life. So I want some stranger's opinion on if i am being an asshole here.",Not the A-hole
AITA for making a point to my husbands sister?,"My husband's older sister considers herself a professional mom. She has seven kids, aged 17 down to 6. She has always liked to give advice to new parents in the family or parents who are struggling. Sometimes the advice comes across as very condescending and I told her this before when she was telling me how I should change my oldest when he was a toddler because she didn't like that he was given choices (between two outfits). She took offense and I told her she didn't need to given unprompted advice. My husband also told her to back off. I think she wrote us off as parents because of this if I'm honest.

And I have been more sure since our daughter was diagnosed on the spectrum three and a half years ago. She feels like we coddle her and don't make her face experiences like every other kid. We do what we have been told to do.

She has extreme anxiety around new things or doing stuff with other kids. For example, she loves computers and video games. So we got her into this summer camp that does computer coding for kids. She struggles with going though and she's made it to 3 of the 15 days so far. My husbands sister was telling me to just drop her off no matter how hard she cries, that she's probably fine the second we leave or even the second she sees it. So I told her to come along for the drive with us two days ago. My daughter was already not wanting to go, but per her therapist and psychologist's advice, we take her and wanted to see if she would calm down. She was hysterical from the time the car started to the time I parked. After twenty minutes (a cool down time to see if she settles), she had made herself sick three times, and was rocking in the back seat. She also started pulling her hair which happens about 40% of the time she's stressed and anxious. I also called her therapist after the whole ordeal because she has shown regression in the last three or so months.

My sister in law was shocked and I told her that is why we don't follow her advice and that is why she doesn't get to dictate how we parent our kids because she has no idea what it was like. She told me I didn't need to be so rude and making a point wasn't helping anyone.

She complained to my husband and three members of the family (father in law, brother in law and another sister in law) and all of them are like what do you expect us to do. But sister in laws husband said it's wrong to try and make people feel bad for not understanding which is what I did.

AITA for not wanting to spend $200 on a wedding gift as a plus-one who has met the groom briefly only 2 times and never even met the bride?,"My boyfriend just found out today he was invited to a close friend's wedding.  He called me up and opened the conversation with the fact that he would like to bring me along, but that he is giving $200 cash and hopes I will be able to contribute another $200 since this is a close friend of his.

I immediately stated this is too much money for me and we got into somewhat of an argument about what is a reasonable amount.  I said I was willing to spend $100 to maybe $150 but my boyfriend pushed back and said he didn't want to appear ""too cheap"" to his friend.  Admittedly, my boyfriend has not been to a wedding since age 15 and didn't do any research as to how much an appropriate gift would be.

I think it's really cheesy and tacky to invite me as a plus-one and expect me to shell out an equal amount when I've only met this guy 2 times.  I admittedly haven't been to many weddings either, but when I looked online I saw many articles say that the plus-one shouldn't even be obligated to pay at all, and I'm already offering $100-150, plus I will have to buy or rent a dress for the occasion.

Btw, I live in Canada if this changes anything.

AITA for flipping out on my coworkers?,"So a little background. I(26M) am the only black employee at a fish factory. It’s a small staff maybe 20 people 6 of which I rarely ever see working day shifts. The majority of the staff is 50+ years in age and mostly women.  So there are two instances in which I had awkward moments with two certain coworkers.

The first occurred about a month ago. A coworker who is regularly rude and bitter to everyone was making small talk with me which it was just us and one other person packaging. So the conversation was about having a possible day off having worked 6 days straight. She told me to not count my chickens. Or my watermelon. So immediately my expression changed because I couldn’t think of a single instance in which that even makes sense. And to make it worse she said she liked watermelon too though she knew she said something bad. 


The second instance was her close frenemy. I was loading a palette with a girl I work closely to every day. She came over and said we were a good team. I felt the same sensation coming as usually I keep to myself and making small talk is always bad. So she says we reminded her of a song. The song was Ebony and Ivory (by Stevie wonder and Paul McCartney)


So if I’m being honest I was having a bad day. But the fact that someone reminded me of being black in that setting caused me to lose my cool. I called her a toothless lawn gnome and accused her of being insensitive. Of all the songs why pick that one? The other lady came over and asks me what my problem was and I said I didn’t have enough watermelon and I left without even clocking out. 

AITA for being offended? I admit my reaction was ill timed but were those comments not extremely rude?


Edit: thank you for all the support and the nice pms! I do Wanna say that my job- possibly former job doesn’t have an HR department it’s a local factory that’s privately owned and the only thing close would be my manager and honestly I feel uncomfortable bringing it up. Maybe that’s my own fault. But thank you all so much !",Not the A-hole
AITA for not paying for my niece's college even though I can?,"I (45F) and my husband J (49M) have 4 children, T (20M), S (18F) and V(9F) and C (7M). The older two children are biologically my cousin brother's kids. Him and his wife unfortunately passed away when the kids were just 2 years and 3 months old. None of the family members were able to or wanted to take in the children. I was the youngest and still in med school then but my husband was financially stable. He was extremely fond of T (S had just been born) so he suggested we become legal guardians for the time being. It was the best decision of my life.

Last week at a family get together S announced she got a full scholarship to her dream university, my cousin sister pulled me aside to tell me that my niece was 18 and had gotten excepted into the same university as S. I congratulated her but then she said to transfer S's and T's( he got scholarship as well) college fund to her account to pay for niece's tuition and living expenses as the university was out of state. I thought she was joking and laughed in her face but she glared at me and told me that since I was going to pay for T and S, I have to pay for her daughter as well because both are my niece's. I said T and S were mine and J's children (we formally adopted them). She said since T, S and my niece are first cousins (she is sibling of my late cousin brother), they are the same and my children don't need it anyways. I was extremely annoyed at this point and said even so it was still their money and for them to do as they please. She left it at that and I thought it was over but today she called me saying she was willing to forgive my 'appalling' behaviour if I paid for my niece's tuition and living expenses as a apology gift. I told her she was out of her mind and hung up. After cooling down a bit and thought maybe I should just suck it up abd pay it to keep the peace and was talking with my husband about it and he told me I am not obligated to help and it should be my decision. 

I finally decided not to. Now family members are calling me an asshole because I broke my niece's dreams over some grudge. It's not that I hate her but her behaviour towards my children and family has never been the best and my niece has never tried to reach out or bond with my kids instead has sometimes belittled them but that is another story. All relatives know this so they think that is the reason and well, that is a part of it.

ETA - When she called me she did not ask for my children's funds, I had made it clear that I wasn't going to give it. She wants me to give her money out of savings. That is why I am asking, I would never give my children's funds but maybe I'm the asshole for not giving money from savings which will still leave enough for retirement.

Edit 2- Since a lot of people were confused, in my culture, first and second cousins are given the same importance as siblings and hence we grow up calling them as a cousin brother or sister. My late cousin brother and the cousin sister in question were siblings. I am their first cousin.

AITA for calling my wife a hypocrite?,"Edit to add: Wife and I (26F) are both females, and I am the pregnant one.  

We’re having our third baby in about a week. My mom (46F) and my little sister (9F) came to stay with us for the summer to help out with our twins, leading up to and following the birth. My wife (27F) doesn’t care for my sister much (she has a lot of trauma and internal issues that make her a difficult child to be around). Nonetheless, they are our guests and I want them to feel comfortable. 

A couple of weeks ago, they had watched a movie on one of the TVs using our Disney+ account. At the time, my wife said to me “hey, can you let them know to make their own profile for Disney+ so it doesn’t mess up my shows” (since they watch a lot of the same ones). Cool. I asked them to make their own profile next time they used the account. A few days later, we go to watch something on Disney+ and they created an account (presumably my sister) and made the profile name “your forever guests”, because she’s 9, and she thought it was funny, and because they’re here for the whole summer. My wife’s mom (who also has access to our Disney+ account) saw it and texted my wife saying “what’s that about?” and it led to my wife venting to me about how annoying it was that my sister couldn’t just put her name “like a normal fucking person” and said it was “rude to do that on someone else’s account.” 

Fast forward to now… my wife gave a friend our Disney+ login so they could watch a movie we just recently bought. When she did that, they made their own profile and named it “aunt mark”… to be funny… he’s a male, he’s not an aunt, etc. So after a couple days of thinking about it, I finally brought it up to my wife and said “how come my sister’s bothered you so much, but YOUR friends didn’t? Seems kind of hypocritical.” And she completely blew me off and said I’m being crazy and taking it personally and just wanted to start something. However, it seems pretty black and white to me….

I know this is stupid and minuscule, but AITA for thinking that’s just plain hypocritical and annoying?",Not the A-hole
AITA Over my dead body will I pay for this funeral,"AITA in summary, my mothers sister passed away. I was not close to my aunt and saw her a handful of times as she lived abroad.

I got a call from my dad telling me my sisters and I need to contribute $800 each (there are 3 of us) as our family needs to contribute $2500 and my mothers brothers and sisters will do the same (there are 5 of them). 

It seems quite strange that the funeral taking place in nigeria will cost over $12,500 dollars... I think they are not being upfront about the costs and want us to pay for their flights to attend ( they will be travelling from America) .

Also don't like the fact they are telling and not asking me to contribute this money and being very manipulative saying my sisters have agreed its just you.

Growing up they always complained about not having money, so i grew up really independent and never asked for much ... now  I'm older as a gesture of good will i give them $400 every month and pay my own mortgage, bills etc.

But they always have a context for asking for more money than necessary in every situation. I can definitely afford to give them the money I just don't think they deserve it.

EDIT: The plot thickens ...Spoke with my sisters and my dad lied to us all telling each of us, that our other sisters have already paid to guilt us into handing the money without asking questions ... he even asked one of my sisters to lie if questioned.

As dumb as it may sound, I'm going to give him the money, clearly saying I wont be providing monthly payments for the next few months ... I have no intentions to provide him with a dime after this and his greediness will serve as his downfall long-term.",Not the A-hole
AITA for snapping at my parents during a party when I felt ganged up on?,"I (21f) don't have the best relationship with my parents. We have a complicated history due to their fantasy of the family they built together.  The short story is they didn't. My half siblings hated me and mom but she never stopped believing they loved us, and my dad never ever believed their rejection was real. They pushed us together and I was rejected. They would get upset with me for not trying. And sometimes they plain forced us together which always ended with me in tears, feeling like shit, and my parents telling me it was all in my head. Yet all three half siblings cut us all off as soon as they could and the last time I saw them was my aunt's funeral and they told my dad when he tried to get us to sit together for the service that I was the ""termite he should have terminated"". By 14 I was mad at my parents instead of sad. They would still make me sign birthday and Christmas cards for my half siblings. They would still tell me I should try and find them online and reach out. They even tried to drop me on my grandparents when my half siblings were visiting them, but I walked to a burger joint to eat instead of going inside. My parents were furious when they found out.

They invited them to my high school graduation and bitched the whole time they when they didn't even respond to the invite let alone show up. I didn't speak to my parents after that. I started living on my own and working. 

Anyway, I was at a party thrown by my boyfriends parents. His parents know mine. We grew up together and our parents always got along. While there my parents started to press me about why I was ignoring them and I asked them to leave me alone, they approached me several times, even when I went outside. Also bringing up my half siblings in the process. Then they actually got my boyfriends parents involved and all four approached me. I snapped and told them they should have been better parents if they wanted us to have a relationship while I was an adult. Instead they pushed and pushed me into rejection over and over again as a kid and lied about my half siblings loving me when they have shown many times they don't. I told them to leave me alone and let me live my life without their shitty parenting in it.

My boyfriends parents are pissed at me for snapping at a party where everyone could hear. My parents have said through them they think I'm TA. My boyfriend told his parents they should have asked my parents to cool it if they didn't want a confrontation.

But I feel bad. Like snapping made me as low as them.

WIBTA if I told my sister to stop bringing up the fact that I used to be homophobic?,"The title sounds bad, but hear me out. I (15F) have a gay sister (17F). 

From third to sixth grade, my older brother had cancer, my mom was constantly away with him for treatment in other cities, and then my mom was in and out of rehab for about a year after. 

Most of the time, it was just my dad, sister, and me. In elementary school here, you don’t learn about sexuality and gender. So when my dad, who’s homophobic and transphobic, said all of this stuff to me for three years, it of course transferred to me. No one was talking about it, so I was isolated with only one source of information as a CHILD.

Around fifth grade or so, my sister told me she was gay. I immediately told my dad. I feel horrible and disgusted with myself over this, and I’ve apologized profusely. 

Halfway through sixth grade I started to realize that my dad was horribly wrong, and began to reach out into the internet to learn more about sexuality. By the time I was in seventh grade, I was an ally to the community, and felt horrible about what I did to my sister.

I don’t remember everything I did to her other than outing her and maybe a few mean comments, but I do remember hiding her pride flag constantly.

I wasn’t close with my sister since we were very little, so we just didn’t talk, and I guess that she thought I was still homophobic.

In eighth grade, I realized I was bi, and I told her because I thought she could help me. For the first few months, she told me I was doing it for attention, I was straight, and I was still homophobic. 

I started trying to explain to her that I was horribly sorry about everything I had done, how when I was younger I didn’t know anything but the things my dad said. I know I caused my sister pain and trauma, and I still feel horrible about that. 

But here’s the problem, it’s been over a year, she’s accepted me, and yet she will still bring up the fact that I used to be homophobic. In almost every real argument. It’s been over a year since I came out, and at this point I can’t take the constant “well are you still homophobic?” whenever I tell her she shouldn’t say a slur or make fun of burn victims. I’ve brought up to her before that it’s not fair to bring that up, simply because it has nothing to do with the argument. Over the past year, I have explained to her what my mindset was back then, how impressionable I was, and how I feel horrible. 

I don’t think she should keep using it as a shield for any argument we have, and of course she can bring it up when it’s relevant or wants to talk about it, and I realize it’ll always be with her, but yesterday I was telling her how she shouldn’t make fun of burn victims and she asked me if I was still homophobic.

AITA For Buying My 13 Year Old Niece A Bra,"Father's day weekend my (36f) niece (13f) came to stay with me for her birthday. She lives with my brother and his fiancé. My nieces relationship with my brother's fiancé is odd..My future SIL is nice and takes care of my niece like she is her own, but doesn't really relate to her. My niece likes anime and comics and is sarcastic with a dry wit. Also my niece  feels awkward around my future SIL because they are so different.  She likes our house because it's quiet, she can watch anime and talk about comics with my husband. Also  my mother was living with us to help us take care of our newborn twins so she would get to spend time with everyone. My niece and I are very close and she recently lost her birth mother. She isn't the type of kid that cries, but she was having spells of being really moody after the funeral. We wanted to make sure she had a fun stress free birthday. 

So here's what happened....She got a ton of birthday money and wanted to go shopping so I wanted to take her. I needed to go to the mall anyway to get my husband's father's day gift so we made it a whole afternoon trip to the mall with my 15 year old son and my newborn son. 

While we were getting ready for the mall my niece tells me that she only had the sportsbra she was wearing (which she had been wearing for 9 days straight) and no underwear. I told her ok, we will stop by the VS PINK in the mall and get her what she needs. Since I had one of my twins with me, getting everything from one place made it easier for everyone.  I got her 2 plain cotton bras and 5 pairs of underwear (no thongs or cheekies, no red or black.  just regular cut panties in pastel colors). We got home, my mother, her Nana, who is very conservative, approved of everything purchased. 

I didn't think about this again. 

Two weeks later I get a message from my brother's soon to be wife. She felt hurt and disrespected that I took my niece to get a bra and that buying a bra is a mother and daughter experience I ruined for her. She went on to say that Victoria Secret is an inappropriate place to buy underwear for a 13 year old.  I was totally caught of guard. We ended up arguing about it and eventually just agreed to disagree.  Her point of view is that as her ""mom"" she should have bought  her first bra (didn't know it was her first bra) and that Victoria Secret is inappropriate . My point of view is that she is my niece and she needed these items so I got them. I took her to VS PINK which is designed for younger girls between 12  and 24. 

So am I the asshole for taking her to get a bra at VS PINK?

UPDATE: My niece has plenty of sportsbras and underwear at her house, but when she packed her bag for the weekend to come to my house she didn't pack anything. She was staying Thursday night to Sunday and my brother lives an hour away.

Her and her mom were close even when the drugs took over the last 4 years.The spoke everyday and texted constantly.

AITA for reporting one of neighbors for harassment at the pool?,"I’m 17F and when I arrived at the pool there was a family of 5 there. It started drizzling out of nowhere so I wanted to go under the only roof part where there’s 4 pool chairs so I wouldn’t get soaked. 

This woman there with her husband and 3 kids didn’t let me, since she threw all her stuff on the pool chairs as I was heading over. She wouldn’t even let me stand under the roof as she kept trying to push me away saying I needed to social distance.

I don’t know if the camera caught it because it’s a shaded area, so I reported her to the community association for harassment because I felt it kind of was. I think she caught on because they now installed another camera under that part since they only have a few there.

I don’t really talk to her much, but she says it was my fault for being unprepared and wearing just a two piece. She says she needed that space for her family and I would’ve talked to her husband but she didn’t let me ask him if I could borrow the chair.

AITA for refusing to cancel on clients to help my parents go on vacation dog-free,"I am the owner and only employee of a small business, that provides dog walking and house/ pet sitting services. I usually book sitting stays about 6-9 months out, with the exception of peak travel weeks and holidays (which are often booked a year in advance). I always try to be accommodating to last minute bookings but they are not always something I can work into my schedule and I am very upfront and honest with my clients about it when I can't. 

In June, my parents decided they wanted to go on vacation. They booked two separate weeks in July and then contacted me, asking me to watch their 15 year old beagle mix. I happened to have a cancelation earlier in the day for the first week they wanted and was able to accommodate that set of dates, but the other set of dates had been booked nearly a year prior and I informed my parents of this. I made it very clear I was not available for the second set of dates. 

Flashforward to the first set of dates and suddenly (two days before the stay starts), I'm informed I'll not just watching the 15 year old dog (who can barely walk) but I'll also be watching my sister's 3 month old puppy as well. I had to monitor and keep the overly enthusiastic puppy shenanigans to a minimum around the old dog and keep their feeding areas separate to prevent fights. These dogs don't live together regularly. It was stressful and a lot to handle by myself especially since the decision to leave the puppy was last second. 

Now the second set of dates are coming up. 

Yesterday, I picked up a few doggies and took them to walk in my parent's neighborhood - my mom found us and asked me if I'm excited to watch her dog in 2 weeks... which I am not. Because like I said (a month before) I've had that week booked with another dog for nearly a year. My mom rolled her eyes and asked me to cancel on them. I am not canceling because my parents decided to travel at the last minute. I said this directly to her face. They are also going somewhere dog friendly, so it's not that they can't take her with them, they'd just prefer not to take the 15 year old dog with them (which is understandable, but still not my problem?)

My mom messaged me a few hours later saying ""you're really stiffing us on this vacation??"". Does it even qualify as ""stiffing"" someone on something if you've already told them multiple times in advance that you are unable to do the thing? Am I being unreasonable about this?

AITA for being pissed gf left parents last vacation early for bachelorette party,"My dad is in hospice (the end for terminal cancer). He said a couple weeks ago that his final desire was to take this trip with his kids and their significant others. We found a place that was available as early as possible to give him that trip. Gf already had a bachelorette party planned for the second half of the trip (1 week trip), but she is just an acquaintance of the bachelorette and really only friends with 1 of the girls - not the bachelorette. 

In planning the trip, she was threatening to not even come on the trip unless I bought specific flights for her because the bachelorette party has been on her schedule for 3+ months. We have been dating for 4+ years and she keeps hinting that she wants to get married soon. 

It is easy to see that my dad is slipping away very fast, and the other significant others are still here. She knows I would have cancelled any plans I had with friends if the situation was reversed, but she was adamant that she went on the trip with her friends.

Anyway, on the 4th of July (American independence day for those that don't know), my family had a bbq at my grandma's (dad's mom) house. I brought some (legal) fireworks, partly for myself but mainly for my nieces (5 and 10). I cleared this with my grandma first. 

I start setting them off and my dad tells me to stop. I ask why. He immediately gets mad and says because I said so. I tell him he has no authority over me and thus I don't have to follow his orders and that grandma told me it was  ok. He got even more mad and started screaming at me. I basically just ignored him and started lighting them again, and he went inside. 

He's still pissed about this and wants an apology. Not going to happen. Where I think I may be the asshole is that while most of my relatives including my grandma say I was in the right overall, they think I should have tried to talk to him inside so my nieces didn't witness the altercation.",Not the A-hole
AITA For telling my MIL she can’t spend time with her grandkids?,"My MIL is a conservative Christian, and my husband and I have much more liberal views, and I am personally atheist. This has caused issues many times in our relationship over the years, mostly in the form of her talking about religion to our children in a way we aren’t comfortable with. We’ve told her repeatedly that we would like to be the ones to talk about religious matters with them, and until recently we haven’t any issues. 

She asked if she could keep my daughters (8 and 12) overnight, and I reluctantly agreed. I’m 9 months pregnant and thought a little break might be nice. When they came home the next day my eldest daughter immediately broke down and told me her grandma was saying mean things that really bothered her. She then explained that they were shopping at Target and saw a Jojo Siwa shirt and joked that they wanted to get it, MIL told them “I would never buy something of hers for my grandchildren because she’s gay.” My eldest daughter came out to us about a year ago, and for her to hear this kind of homophobia from her grandmother was heartbreaking for her. She hasn’t told anyone else in the family that she’s gay, but we have told her we will support her no matter what. She broke down crying to me, and I told my husband we needed to talk to his mom about it. When confronted, she refused to apologize and stood her ground on the matter. She also refused to keep her mouth shut about her views on homosexuality. I told my husband we could no longer have her around the children. It seems like such a shame, especially since all she had to do was apologize and agree to keep her views private. Am I the asshole for cutting her out of their lives for good?",Not the A-hole
AITA For not returning a laptop my relative gave me?,"So me and my mom we both went to a relative's house. She was talking about an old laptop from 2015 that doesn't work fast enough for her. And she offered me that laptop and i thought ""why not"". 

I took it my house, bought a 2tb ssd and increased to 16gb ram and did a reset to start fresh. It was fast af. I was happy with this laptop and it was with me for past 3 months now. Yesterday she came to visit us and asked me how the laptop is and i showed her fast the laptop is now and all of a sudden she wants it back for ""urgent reason"". I didn't give it back and argued with her for half an hour. She stormed out of my house and threatened to take legal action against me. Seems very extreme for such a small thing. My parents are yelling at me to give it back but i already dropped my hard earned $350 on this laptop. How can i give it back and not be angry?

AITA for leaving my dad’s early instead of babysitting?,"Haven’t seen my dad in almost 7 months because I (23M) live like half a day away with my girlfriend. Last weekend I decided to ask for some time off to go see my pops. And I asked if it was cool for me to stay there so we can hang out and do something on Saturday. My dad said that would be great. He seemed happy about it so I thought that was the plan. I made the drive got there by Friday night and slept on the couch at his place. My dad has a wife and they have my little brother (6). Saturday morning my stepmom is saying me and my bro should go to the beach or something fun out of the house. But I told her well my dad and I had plans to have some guy time. My brother could come tho no problem. 
She said they had plans already. When I talked to my dad he said he was sorry. My stepmom got all excited after he told her I was coming. She thought this would be great time for them to go out. Guess they were gonna do a spa day, go out to eat then movies. It was gonna take the whole day. My dad though we could do something together on Sunday. But Sunday was literally when I was leaving. Probably have like 2 hours to spend time together before I needed to be on the road.  I got pretty mad at him, I told him I didn’t drive for hours to babysit. Whole point of coming out was to spend time with him. He kept saying he’s sorry, my stepmom just jumped at it and he doesn’t want her feeling bad. Then she got involved with I should be happy to spend time with my brother. Especially with me staying at their house “for free.” 

Well I told my dad no point in me staying if we’re only gonna have a couple hours to hangout. So I just got my stuff and made the drive back home. She thinks I was a huge asshole now for being bratty instead of doing something nice for them. And they couldn’t even got out after I left. I was mad when I left because of the change of plans with literally no warning but idk if I was an asshoel for basically doing the same thing to them and refusing to babysit my brother so they could have their time.

AITA for siding with my mom in a fight against my parents?,"My parents divorced when I was 7 and at the time they had this huge fight on a burial plot they bought together during their marriage. Mom wanted dad to buy her share of it, dad said no. Dad later remarried and recently his wife died. Dad wanted his wife buried in said plot. Mom said hell no. She told him the only way he can do it is if he buys her share. That she does not want to pay for his wife's burial plot. He said she was being insensitive and it's been more than twenty years now. Mom told him that they wouldn't need to have this fight again if he'd just bought her share back during the divorce. I told my dad mom was right, that it was a lot to expect her to pay for half the plot, but get no spot there, and have to pay for another one. He told me I shouldn't pick sides and called me an asshole to do this while he's grieving. I told him he was the one venting to me (which he was, all damn day).

AITA for boycotting cleaning until my father and brother start picking up after themselves?,"I’m the youngest in my family with a mom who’s disabled, so I started cleaning for everyone since I generally enjoy cleaning. But lately i’ve started paying more attention to what I clean.

Almost all of the messes are made by my older brother and father. All of the unrinsed dishes, the dirt tracked through the house, random wrappers and water bottles, dirty clothes, unflushed toilets, Half-eaten subway sandwiches left on the table for three days: All from them. Not to mention they never walk our dogs or feed them, even though they are my brother's dogs. So I started asking them to do simpler things like rinsing (not washing, just a quick rinse) your dishes, wiping your feet before coming in, using a hamper, and taking your trash with you when you get up. Oh boy did that not work.

It caused my brother, who doesn't work or go to school, to get pissed off at me, and tell me how “You LOVE to clean! I’m giving you something to do!” And my father told me that he’s too busy with work (he works weekends.), and that since I don't work, even though I do work under the table jobs & stay ontop of school, that I should be happy with just cleaning. They insisted that they always  clean up after themselves and always leave the house spotless. And when I told them that even the little things help me out, they told me the ask my mom for help. Y’know, the disabled one. And bless her soul, she would help me in a heartbeat, but I don't want her to be working.

So I started to leave all of their messes and only cleaned where my mom would regularly be, her bathroom, and my room. And the house got messy really fast, and I'm just hoping that they'll realize how bad their messes really are and at least stop leaving the refrigerator open. But I kinda feel like an asshole for dumping the cleaning on them so suddenly even though I gave them enough warning.

AITA for not being the designated driver.,"
Ok, 1st, I’m a 19yr old male, I don’t drink, I don’t smoke or do drugs, I don’t go to huge gatherings often ( even before covid), and I value caution to a fair extent. My friend (18M) drinks a lot, smokes a lot, does drugs a lot, and likes to party. I know, exact opposites but he’s cool and we have more important things that connect us. 

He wanted me to go with him to a party. I would know maybe 5 other ppl at this party and it was almost guaranteed to be filled with things I’m not fond of. Im sometimes chilling with him and a small group of ppl I actually care about while they break 50 laws, and this doesn’t bother me much because nobody tries to peer pressure me and I like hanging with my bros. 

The main issue, is that he wanted me to drive back. I don’t have a license. Sorry for the identity politics, but I’m black in the south. There would be drugs and drinks in the car and we are all under age. 

Naturally I said no without hesitation. He responded by mentioning how without a designated driver he could crash and die. That there would be no issue with police, no arrests, no fines, and that it would be fun.

I name dropped someone who has a license, likes to party, and could refrain from drugs and drinks to be the designated driver. He didn’t want to take this person. Said that it’s sick that I would rather he risk death than stop being a prude.

I’m not forcing him to risk his life, and he isn’t my responsibly. He said the main thing is he just wants to party with me, but what’s wrong with small gatherings?",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to give my aunt my grandmother’s rings?,"AITA for refusing to give my aunt my grandmother’s rings?

I (31F) lost my grandmother 20 years ago now, due to cancer. She lived with my family & took care of us kids, until she got sick. Even then, my mum took care of her while she was sick. 

My aunt, my mother’s sister, hasn’t talked to us in those 20 years—in fact, she lives across the country. She flew out when my grandmother was sick, but left before my grandmother passed & missed the funeral. She blamed my mother for it, even though my mum offered to let my aunt live with us to be closer to her mother in the end. She refused and flew back out west. It’s been silence since. 

My grandmother & I were very close. I was only 11 when she passed, a week before my 12th birthday. She left ALL her jewelry, including her & my grandfather’s wedding & eternity rings to me, which I have in my possession.  

Fast forward to a year ago, my aunt found out she had the same cancer my grandmother had. She contacted my mum to mend ways, writing letters to her. There was no mention of the rings. 

My aunt had surgery, but it was botched and she also had a stroke. She’s in a long-term care home, unable to move her left side, but refuses to do physio to get better. 

My mum decided to do a Zoom meeting to see if she could lift her sister’s spirits. First thing my aunt writes down is, “Do you have Mum’s rings?” 

It has upset both my mum & myself. Not only are those rings mine, they were left to me (we have my grandmother’s last wishes in a letter & it states that), my aunt hasn’t said a word about the rings before. Not when she visited when my grandmother was still alive & not in the entire 20 years since. 

My friends mentioned I should maybe give her the wedding bands…mainly because the eternity rings are what’s important to me, but I don’t think she has the right to demand any of the rings. 

I refuse to give her the rings. AITA?

AITA for not giving up my game night for her bad day?,"Wife and I (m35) are gamers- she likes to play MMOs on our gaming PC and I play on a console and we have our own rooms to play in.  I recently found and played a game that I loved on console that was also on PC and I wanted to play it on PC for the achievements and to start from scratch.  

Wife and I negotiated splitting PC time and I would get: Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday and she would get the rest as the weekend is the best time to play with her friends online.

No problems until today she calls me and says she had a headache and had a bad day at work so she’s like to just come home and play on the PC and I reminded her that it’s my day and so I’ll be willing to trade for Friday.  She said no I want to play on Friday because of her friends.  Told her it wouldn’t be fair to get Wednesday-Saturday so I need Friday or Saturday in return.

She told me whatever and hung up.  Now she’s mad at me for not letting her play because of her bad day.

AITA for asking my colleague not to speak to me unless it's directly related to work?,"My colleague, M (late 50's?), is a very nice lady, but I really can't stand being in her presence. I feel awful about it, but there it is.

Part of the problem is that she interjects herself into every conversation she sees me having. And it's usually really annoying interruptions. Also, it's an open plan office, so it's hard for me to find a place to hide from her. 

As an example, I was talking with my boss about needing a Plan B in the event of a current plan not working out. I guess M overheard, because she shouted out ""Not to mention Plan C, Plan D, Plan E and Plan F. I'll take Plan H - a vacation in Hawaii!"" She then stood up and did a hula dance. This completely derailed my train of thought, and I found it hard to pick up the conversation afterwards. Another time, I was talking to a colleague, and she came over and stuck her phone under my nose and asked me to guess how old a baby in a picture was. I told her I was having a work discussion, and she said ""I'll let you get back to it as soon as you guess right!"" I couldn't do it, and she kept scrolling through pictures and demanding I try again.

Today, my work computer was failing, so I was talking with my boss about bringing in my home computer. We were working out the logistics of it (what would happen in case of damage, etc) and M interrupted with ""Won't that be fun for you? You get to take your computer on a little trip!"" I said, definitely more shortly than I needed to, that no, it would not be fun, but it would be necessary. She replied ""My computer is so small I can just carry it in my bag! I love it. I'll bring it tomorrow and we can be computer buddies!""

I have ADD, which I usually manage pretty well, but stuff like this really does throw me off whatever I'm trying to focus on. I know that's my issue to deal with, but this happens at least twice an hour with her, and I'm at my wits end.

So after the computer thing, I asked her not to speak to me unless it was directly related to work. She asked for my home number then, so she could call me for chats after work hours. I said I'm really not interested in being social with people from work (not true, I have many work friends I see socially, but I thought it might be kinder than saying I just don't like her). She was pretty obviously hurt though, and left a very long message on my work voicemail about how she always tries to be nice, and people like me just bring her down, and that's what's wrong with the world.",Not the A-hole

AITA for fighting with my siblings while we plan our mother's funeral?,"I'm the youngest in a family of four. Our mother passed away unexpectedly four days ago. Her death was hard for my siblings, but much more mixed for me. I loved my mother most of my life and then my feelings changed. When my son came out at 12 she was viciously homophobic and treated my son like shit the one and only time we saw her after that. My son was broken. He adored his grandma and to have her reject him the way she did. In the following 12 years nothing had changed. If anything she got more homophobic and much more ugly about it. I only spoke to her, in passing, a handful of times.

I told my son a number of years ago, when we talked about my mother, that when the day came she died, he was not to come to her funeral for me, or because of pressure, but only if he wanted to go for himself. I always swore he would never be expected to show up for anything surrounding her when she treated him so abhorrently. I reminded him of this the day she died. He was willing to come for me. I told him if I'm the only reason he does not have to come.

My siblings are unhappy with my choice to encourage this. They claim he should be there as her grandson, and the fact I am telling him he doesn't have to come is wrong. I told them I don't give a crap. That there isn't as much for him to grieve when the woman treated him the way she did. They told me I was being insensitive and should think of them. We got into a fight over the whole thing. I told them I was too old for it and I left.

AITA for telling my wife I wont/can't watch our son?,"I have a good job, I make good money and I work hard enough to earn it. To the point that about 4 years ago after our son was born when my wife decided not to go back to work I became the only source of income. 

This worked out well and everyone was happy until COVID hit. Once the pandemic started causing shut downs my role was transitioned from in an office downtown to working from home. I was a big fan of this. I work 5am to 7pm Mon to Sat typically so not having to commute meant that now I got to be home to put my son to bed and read to him at night and have more time to spend with my wife in the evenings. The only problem is that my wife has struggled with the idea that the location of my job has changed but my responsibilities have not. I've had several discussions with her about the fact that even though I'm home now I'm not able to watch our son during the day, or explaining why I can't get to the dishes till that evening. She will nod along to but I don't think she really believes it. This has caused tension but not an outright fight until this week.

Some of our mutual friends are coming into town this weekend and we had made plans to spend time with them. However, on Monday my wife informs me that the couple is actually getting in Friday and she and her friend are going to get lunch and go shopping. She tells me that I will need to watch our son. I respond by saying again that I can't, I have work and Monday to Friday is not enough heads up for me to take a day off. She gets angry at me saying she watches our son everyday while I just ""sit in my office from sun up to sun down"" and how I should be able to watch our son so she can have a day off.

AITA for unfriending my friend's wife on FB?," I don't know when being FB friends became the end-all, be-all of relationships, but here's the story. A very, very close friend of mine whom I've known since childhood and considered part of my family got pissed at me for unfriending his wife on FB, and emphatically declared that our friendship in general was over. Why did I unfriend his wife? Because she posted a transphobic meme. I'm trans. I was pretty hurt and insulted, and I figured the best way to handle the situation was to just unfriend her so I didn't have to see shit like that anymore. (For anyone who wants to say ""you could have unfollowed her instead of unfriending"" I honestly don't get the point of that kind of pretense. If you're anti-trans, you're not my friend and I'm not going to pretend like you are. I'm not obligated to do so.) He got super pissed and told me I'd become a ""hateful person"" and that his wife didn't ""mean"" to insult trans people, she was just trying to honor her birth mother (she's adopted, which I actually didn't know). Thing is, the meme literally mocked trans-inclusive language as ""making us the stupidest generation ever."" I don't understand how someone could look at that and NOT think it's insulting to trans people. I pointed out to him that there are probably a trillion memes out there that honor birth mothers without slamming trans people in the same breath. I actually thought I made my points really well, but he's stopped talking to me completely, and I still can't believe he would end our friendship over this. The deafening silence on his part when I came out didn't escape my notice, and now I feel like our friendship has been a lie for a while. If he's not only okay with but actively trying to justify anti-trans rhetoric, that tells me he thinks my entire identity is bullshit and worthy of being a punchline. I'm literally stunned that things went this way. And for him to call me ""hateful"" just because I don't want to see anti-trans bullshit? I'm at a loss. Am I in the wrong for this??",Not the A-hole
AITA for stopping another parent from talking to my kid at the park?,"Today I took my (30f) son (6) to a local park. He had brought a small ball to play with, that he and another kid were rolling to eachother down a spiral slide. At some point the ball shot off the end of the slide and my kid lost track of it. 

When we found it another little boy (younger, probably about 2 or 3 years old) had it and didn't initially want to give it back. My son started to tear up and get upset, but didn't yell or say anything mean, and the other kid's dad intervened and made his kid give back the ball.

 I thought the situation was done, so I called my kid over to me. As he turned, still visibly unhappy from the altercation he said ""mom that kid tried to steal my ball."" I went to respond to calm him down but before I could talk the other kid's dad stopped my son and began to lecture him about how his son wasn't stealing, he was just little and didn't understand. 

I made my way over trying to interrupt the guy and diffuse the situation calmly, but he continued to talk over the top of me and  told my kid that he ""thought it was time that he (my son) went home"". It was then that I got louder and in between this guy and my son and told him that he needed to leave my kid alone and that it was inappropriate for him to chastise someone else's kid like that.

 He started to argue with me and say that ""it wasn't inappropriate to talk to a kid 'politely' at the park"" after a few more short words which admittedly got a little heated I told him to leave us alone and that I was done talking to him.

Have since found out about multiple infidelities, alcoholism, and mortgage unpaid in 15 months. Bank foreclosing on the house, I have 3 months to leave but can't afford to stay that long, moving out ASAP. He still has posessions here he intends to take, but has not shown up to collect.

In the past 2 months, he has:

1. Updated his taxes from last year to refile as 'separated', triggering a reassessemnt of mine, and a $550 'penalty' for filing as married...even though we WERE still married in 2020, lol

2. Removed 2 trailers from our property that are registered in my name, and refusing to return them or discuss them unless I pay him for them.

3. Removed some of my personal posessions, including jewelery and collectible coins/stamps, and refused to return them.

4. Blocked my number and social media, and only communicated with me through a 3rd party, who isn't exactly operating under the best interests of both parties (found out thanks to an overheard conversation from a pocket dial!).

5. Shown up and removed any items with saleable value from the home and property, including tv, speaker system, furniture, appliances.

I had previously agreed to give him advance notice when I vacated the property, so he had time to retrieve the last of the items he claimed as his.

Mortgage is in my name only, although he was responsible for paying it (between the 2 of us), he is not connected to it on any documentation.

AITA For Refusing To Change The Quality Of My Food Because Of A Jealous Coworker.,"Hello Reddit, I am on mobile so excuse any typos or formatting errors please.

So I transferred cities about half a year ago or so, and in this new site we work 12 hour shifts (8am to 8pm or 8pm to 8am). 

That means that since I have a very high metabolism and I am not a fan of the cafeteria on site, that I pack a breakfast, a lunch, 2 snacks and a baked good to have with my very very late tea (or 2 dinners, 2 snacks and a breakfast) 

Now I am a huge foodie, have been learning to cook since I was 8, and I took a couple baking and cooking classes.

Since we work in a very tight knit office, we all have our meals together (4 people) and I usually pack a bit more since I like sharing food with my team-mates.

Fast forward to yesterday and I get a call from a fellow co-worker, one who works my opposite shift (think on nights while I am on days and vice-versa), who also happens to be married to one of my team-mates.

She was very aggressive from the get go, demanding that I stop bringing my ""elaborate"" meals to the office, that I should just do what everyone else does and get my meals from the cafeteria.

I was firm, said that it was not her business what I eat or where I buy my food from.

Then she comes out and says that her husband has been complaining non-stop about how she does not make him good food like I do, how she isn't as put together as I am, how I am always pleasant and smiling from the start to the finish of my shift while all she does is complain (to be fair I had very strict parents groing up, and that translated to never stepping foot outside of my bedroom unless I was dressed and ready to face the world) 

I felt bad for her, told her that these kinds of things should be discussed between her and her husband and that I shouldn't be involved in them. But also that I will not stop bringing meals from home. She hung up on me after calling me a b*tch. 

IMO I think he needs a reality check that his wife is not responsible for all his meals, they work the same hours and should share housework. Also he should stop comparing her to other women. But she also should not be blaming me for living my best life.

My sister has a habit of not respecting food and personal belongings when she has visitors. So I woke up to a mess in the kitchen, 3 different cartoons of milk open, eggs and some exquisite butter that I bought for specific occasion just left there to go bad (it's really hot here) for the whole day and they used all gluten free flour I have. She is planning to host another friend for a few days that decided to eat gluten free. I'm asking her for 10 €.  It's a symbolic amount, so she isn't being generous on others account. She thinks it isn't fair, because it's not that much food, which I agree. But it's about the principle. She sometimes takes expensive alcohol and then pours it down the drain when she doesn't drink it. I thought that maybe she'll become mindful about items if she has to pay for them.

So, AITA for asking her to pay me back ? She's 17 and recently started a job.",Not the A-hole
AITA for swearing at my mom for her withholding my meds,"My mom picked up my adhd medication bc im unable to drive due to her not allowing me to ever learn. She told me I needed to do the dishwasher before getting my meds. The dishwasher had just finished so I think it’s better to wait like 30 minutes after it unload to let it cool down so it’s not painful. My mom sat in my meds and said I wouldn’t get them until the dishwasher unloaded. This isn’t fair to me. I know my mom and how throughout my life she has a habit of withholding things and how this could become a habit of hers. Like not letting me get meds until I do something bigger/harder in the future. I don’t think it’s fair to withhold medication or safe. We wouldn’t withhold medication from someone with autism right ?? We wouldn’t withhold medication from a cancer patient and use meds as a way to bribe someone to do die thing. I’ve tried to explain to her adhd meds are for a serious illness and to stop pretending adhd is a joke.  After explaining this she wouldn’t give me the meds so I did the dishwasher while swearing angrily.

Edit: and when I tried explaining to her calmly that if her reason for not letting me have adhd meds was bc she was worried I would forget abt the dishwasher than she was only making that more likely by withholding my meds. And I explained she wouldn’t do this to an autistic kid/ cancer patient bc those disorders are taken seriously. But she just didn’t look at me and said she doesn’t care at all",Not the A-hole
AITA/ For calling out my parents favouritism,"
Sorry for grammar mistakes I'm ranting 

I (20F) live with my mom (49F) and older brother (22M) after my parents divorce. My dad (51M) lives alone and my half sisters live with there own families (27F) & (30F). Ever since I was young , I notice my parents picking favourites. 
An example would be when I was about 6, my brother was allowed to go singing lessons. I would go with my dad and brother to the school, (my father liked to watched) and be told to sit there on a chair in the room and do nothing for about 2 hours. I remember not being allowed to bring any toys or books as it would be a distraction. My brother quit after 2 years cause he didn't like it anymore. When I asked to attend piano or guitar lessons, my parents told me the couldn't afford it. 

Another instance is when I attending my first year of college. I had gotten a big scholarship like $5000, which I would put to transportation, books and food. (I lived 2 hours from school, and my classes are 2 and half hours long). I had told my parents and they were excited for me. However, the next day my father asked me to loan him $4000 to pay for his new car. I agreed, cause I told he would pay me back next year. Which I later regretted, as my brother got his old car and my dad was helping my sisters with there traffic tickets( a lot of speeding and parking violations). This made me angry as they all had decent jobs and can afford the things they needed. When I brought up him paying me back, he would always say soon. It's been 4 years and no money. As a result, I asked my part-time job for more hours to help with my schooling. 

This is just the tip of the iceberg, from disregarding my mental health, forgotten today gifts to getting into a fight on my graduation day cause of food choice. 

this year, I'm living with my mother and founded out I'm paying a higher rent than my brother, by a couple hundred. Also, the money my father had saved up for me to help me with a car was spent on my brother’s new PS5, and my sisters got some bills paid. This was the breaking point. I felt cheated as I was given the same treatment as my siblings. 

So at dinner with my mother I brought it and on a video call I brought it up with my father. They end result for both was an argument saying they treat all their kids fairly and I'm overreacting. Then other family members decided to get involved, as my mother had told them and caused some fighting in the family. 

So AITA, for calling out my parents favouritism.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not giving my sister a car that was gifted to me?,"Back in the late 1980's my sister sold a nice little sports car to my dad.  He's over 80 now, my mother has passed, and dad has been in the process of ""lightening his load"" so to speak. He gave me that car a few years ago because he hasn't driven it in a decade and felt it needed to go somewhere it could be enjoyed rather than sit and dryrot.

My sister was furious. She says, not to me but to my other siblings, that my dad is TA because he should have given her the car, and that I'm TA because I should have given her the car after he gave it to me or insisted he give it to her.

Now, neither I nor my sis needed a car back then.  Still don't. And I wasn't quick to accept it for that reason. But dad hated seeing it sit under a cover in his barn, and he was insistent that I would be the best person to actually make use of it. But my sis is adamant that because it was hers initially, he should have given it to her. That makes little sense to me. He BOUGHT it - paid her a good price because that's how he is - and she didn't need it when he did; she had just bought a new car. He didn't need it either; he just bought it so he and mom would have a little fun zipping around in it.

I really don't see how I'm TA here, but she's pretty insistent that I am to this day. Neither of us are hurting for money, not then or now. Thoughts?",Not the A-hole
"AITA for telling off a ""friend"" that was trying to get my significant other to start dating them?","Around a few days to a week ago, my friend group (consisting of me, my significant other, and 2 other friends) befriended a random guy who my friend thought was cool. Although he lived a decent amount away from us, he still found his way into our friend group. Even from the start, I just had a gut feeling about him. He was oddly flirty with my s/o. Of course, they didn't pick up on it, as they are not the brightest. So, a couple of days later, he was *still* flirting with them. I stepped up and called him out on it. He stated how he was just being friendly and that I'm being overprotective. At the time of calling him out, only him, another friend and I were there. I was really passionate about my relationship, so I went off on him, cussing him out, etc. My other friend took his side and told me how sometimes I did worry too much, and to tone it down. We started arguing for around an hour before the guy left our friend group altogether. My friend started telling me how I just lost everyone here a friend and how nice and he was. I rolled my eyes and left. My s/o still not knowing about what happened, the guy confronted them.
""It's kind of weird how you're partners with OP, isn't it?""
""He was so rude and overprotective of you, I personally dont know what you see in him."" 
(This is what my s/o sent me after I asked what he said.) Of course, they asked me about what happened, so I filled them in. My s/o is neutral on the situation atm, but my other friends are bitter about the fact that we lost him.
Everyone there except for me really wanted to have a giant group to hang with, and were really excited to have someone like that in their lives.
I have a massive problem with overthinking, so I thought about it more. I could've just gave him a warning, and he probably didn't know he was saying that. Of course, I'm still pissed about how he was borderline manipulative to my s/o, but still. I feel as if we're both in the wrong, but I'm not too sure.
AITA?

Edit: Sorry for not explaining before, but I probably should've explained the type of flirting. He was heavily sexual and making alot of tit jokes when we met, but toned it down a lot when he went into the friend group. Although, he was acting as if my s/o was single. He was saying that they were good looking, and complimenting their skirts. I would've totally looked over that, but he didn't have that behavior towards anyone else in the group. (I'm the only guy in the group.) He moved closer closer to them. I still didn't butt in until he started talking to me about them, talking about how I was a ""real lucky fella"". The anger I described wasn't called for at all, but I bottle up my anger in really intense problems, and release them all in small problems.
(Also, I've been using s/o instead of bf and gf because they are non-binary.)",Asshole
AITA for stepping down as a bridesmaid because my friend didn't go to my dad's funeral?,"I have a lot of issues and while I have caused a lot of them, some can root back to my dad. I won't get into things other than years of him comparing me to other girls, berating me and other actions have left a scar. But when he passed it hurt like hell knowing I'd never get his approval. The last few days he was in hospice care, slowly dying and he still found ways to hurt my sister and I.

Needless to say I'm not ok.

I guess that's why I'm asking.

My friend from high school is engaged and I'm part of the wedding party. Said friend has never understood the relationship I have with my dad (without trying to sound envious, her life has been cushy). Truth is she's never understood much of my pain and I've excused it because not many people do.

I called her the night he died in tears. She didn't know what to say. A few days later she asked if I was still going shoe shopping for her wedding shoes. I declined because you know...strange grief. I told her the date of the funeral. She sent me a thumbs up. I know she had the day off and expected her to at least stop in during visitation. She didn't come and didn't text me at all that day.

Instead a week later I get a message asking if I was still a part of the wedding because I was behind on my dress/shoe/accessory shopping. I've been a basket case with reliving all the things he's done to me, watching him die, planning a funeral and thinking about how the diseases he had at the end of his life could be passed on to my sister and I. I've been short with many people. My friend was no expectation. To sum it up I told her she couldn't be there when I needed her I sure as hell wouldn't be there for her and she can take her wedding and shove it.

Since then I've been receiving messages from both her boyfriend and friends saying I've made her cry and am being completely selfish. As her boyfriend told me I have always expressed a dislike for my dad so his death shouldn't be such a big deal and I'm using it for attention. I can admit I'm an asshole for how I worded things. I intend to apology. Am I the ass though for quitting as her bridesmaid because she didn't come to my dad's funeral?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Since it was asked - In the message with the funeral information I said I hope you can make it. When I called her the night he died I was telling her how much it hurt. Her wedding is 3 months away. She's upset I dropped out and yelled at her, not because she didn't do enough. Where I'm from it's common to go to funerals uninvited. If she couldn't go, stopping at the visitation for a moment or even just a text would have been nice. 

For those saying I need help - guess what I am getting it! But believe it or not grieving really delays your progress and messes with your head. It's something I hope you never have to experience. Also, shut up.

For those brave enough to share their stories of abuse, thank you! Your messages have been uplifting and insightful and I hope you all recovery and great lives.  ",Asshole
AITA for telling my roommate her dog has to go?,"
I(33F) recently bought a new house. One of my friends(27F) from our gym was looking for a new place to live because she’s been living with her parents for the past couple of years and doesn’t have the freedom to come and go as she pleases. 

The dog was never apart of our initial conversation about her moving in. We talked about rent amount and splitting utilities. 

She moved in and everything was great until a week after, she texted me saying her dog got into a fight with her parents dog and has a small cut above her eye and needs a place to go until the cut heals. Okay fine, a couple of days is fine for me. But the dog has not left since and now it’s been a month and she casually moves her dog in. 

I love dogs and playing with them but her dog has had accidents almost everyday for the past couple of weeks. 5 at least in my room alone that I know of. I go home late last night and passed out from being tired and I wake up to a wet spot in my room. I bent down and sure enough it was urine. I’ve kept my door closed since the dog started to have accidents so I’m not sure how this happened. She did tell me she was using my bathtub to clean the dogs paws because of mud and I’m guessing it had an accident after. 

Not only are the accidents and issue, she likes to leave the patio door wide open for her dog to go in and out. It’s 95 degrees everyday day where we live and that’s just cold air escaping the house causing my ac unit to constantly run, which it’s not built to do. 

I hired professional carpet cleaner yesterday because my room reeks of urine because she doesn’t properly clean up the messes. She just pat dries with a lot of paper towels. I had to buy carpet stain and odor removal because I couldn’t deal with the smell. 

I finally got fed up and told her the carpet cleaners are coming tomorrow and the dog has to go. I know she’s been going through a break up and some other personal issues and this dog might be an emotional support animal for her but I’ve had enough. I can’t deal with my house getting ruined because of a pet that was never apart of the agreement. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA My Aunt ate my boyfriend's food and got mad.,"AITA for getting mad at my aunt who ate my boyfriends food I bought and had my name? 
      My aunt has been targeting me for about two weeks cursing under breath at me shoulder checking me when she walks by. Doing things like buying a dress I liked after I said I didnt have the money for it at the time
    Yesterday it all came to a point where when I came home from work I went to get the tray I bought my boyfriend (me and my mother work at the same place so I send it home with her. It cost $2 this is relevant) I couldn't find it and figured he already grabbed it. After speaking to him he hadnt. 
   I went back into the kitchen to look for it and it wasn't there and I asked my mom with aunt present if she knew where it was she said no. As I'm searching I find it in the trash under a bunch of stuff. I tell my mom someone ate it and become more irrate because it has my name clearly on it. She offers me $2 dollars for it and I tell her thats not the point. That I found it buried in the trash.
     My aunt pipes up that she ate the food finally and that my sister told her she could. One thing led to another and not only does my aunt admits to what shes been doing but claims I was doing it to her first. She offers to pay for but I decline and say it's not the point because it was labeled. She claimed she didn't know it was mine. I still think itbwas done out of spite.

WIBTA for exposing someone for lying?,"So a friend (21M) and I (24M) were fucked over by the same guy (that’s actually how we met). The usual “I want a relationship with you blah blah” and then leading us on for two months while cheating the whole time. He led me on from April-May and him from May-June. When he was with my friend, he caught herpes but didn’t say anything. He then gave my friend herpes and chose to just dump him after that.

My friend and I are justifiably pissed and want to expose him on Grindr (yes he still has an account and he’s def not telling people he has herpes). Would it make us assholes to expose him on Grindr and then tell him what a piece of shit he is?

TLDR- WIBTA for exposing an ex for lying

I talked with my friend and since he’s the one that has, I’m gonna leave it up to him whether to pursue legal action.

AITA for not wanting to donate to future BIL’s wedding fundraiser?,"First time poster, new to Reddit. I really don’t know if I’m the asshole here. My partner’s brother is getting married in a couple years and they’re asking for donations. The problem is, we can’t afford it. We live paycheque to paycheque and barely have enough for food after rent and bills. We’ve been sleeping on a broken bed and my back hurts daily, we’ve been trying to save for that. 

Another reason, I’m worried the money won’t actually be saved for the wedding. They’ve both been proven to be irresponsible but I can’t go into too much detail without giving myself away. The fiancée in this situation is the worst of it, she cheats on future BIL, tells him about it and he always takes her back. Future BIL is always an emotional wreck because of her running off constantly. One time we didn’t hear from her for a week only to then find her in jail. 

My partner feels like he needs to support family no matter what. Am I the asshole for suggesting we don’t donate to the wedding? We’ll still bring a gift when the time comes, which will also set us back but we’re not going to just give absolutely nothing.

ETA: Partner and I have talked it through. He was feeling guilty at first, but after reading your comments he started to realize there’s nothing to feel guilty about. We’ve come to the conclusion that if we are to donate, it’s definitely going to be a LOT closer to the wedding, but it’s more likely we will just be doing a gift and if future BIL can’t understand that, well, hopefully he’ll get over it. It’ll be their problem at that point and we’ll do our best to shut it down if they bring it up again afterwards.",Not the A-hole
AITA if I refuse a gift I explicitly asked my mother not to get for me?,"My (25f) and my mother have a dysfunctional relationship that she mostly thinks is great but has been very damaging to me, esp as a kid.

In the past year I’ve been working on myself and have recently gained a new perspective on the relationship and built up the ability to stand by my boundaries (most of the time). Ive also gotten a lot better at recognizing the patterns she uses.

One pattern is to slowly chip away at any decision she dislikes by repeating the same conversation over & over with more emotion until I eventually change my mind. She does this for small things but also major issues. She convinced me to leave therapy as a teenager bc it was ‘bankrupting the family’ (as an adult I know it was fully covered by insurance), convinced me to accept strip searches after seeing friends bc she was convinced were having ‘emo parties’, etc

For the past 3 weeks my mom has been suggesting the recipe/food subscription hellofresh to me. She has never tried it, and she knows I dislike cooking. She loves cooking and wants me to cook more, especially for my fiancé. 

I explained that I didn’t want to try it over and over. My fiancé is picky and wouldn’t enjoy most of the meals, it’s much more expensive than buying your own food, and I DONT LIKE COOKING. We’ve talked about this probably 4-5 times now, and I’ve held firm. The last time I even got frustrated and told her I didn’t want to have this convo again.

This morning she texted me that she bought me a $130 gift subscription for hellofresh and was excited for me to try it, as if we’d never talked about it before.

I’m pissed. I want to respond and tell her I won’t be claiming the gift, and that if she continues to ignore what I say I’ll just stop talking to her. I want her to stop the behavior.

My fiancé says I should claim it & use it but then never renew and tell her I hated it, and my friend says I should just take advantage of the free food and let it go.

AITA for giving a neighbours bully kid two tellings off in the same evening?,"I (M35) decided to take my daughter (2.5) out for a walk round the block with her new scooter this evening. She's still learning to go on it, but when she gets a solid run at it she's really good!

As we were making our way around, I had noticed a couple of boys on bikes (I'd say they were between 10-12) passing us. They were doing fast laps on the road, while we were sticking to the pavement. Suddenly on one lap, one of the boys literally cut onto the pavement in front of us, blocking our path. He looked at my daughter and said ""get off this street, and don't come out until I tell you."" His tone was definitely not light-hearted or funny.

Now, my daughter is 2, and doesn't have a clue what's actually happened here, so she's smiling and waving - I however, am unimpressed. I step between them, and tell the boy ""if you threaten my daughter again, I'll take your bike, and when your parents come to get it I'll tell them how nasty their son is."" He did back off, and we went on our way.

Later we went to the park just opposite our house. We were at the swings, and another girl came into the park, going on a swing near us. Then the same two boys rounded the corner, coming into the park, and making their way over to the girl. She quickly said ""stay away from me, I've asked you before!"" The boys laughed and ignored. I again, intervened, and this time said ""she's told you no, I suggest you get on your way before you get into more trouble."" The girl then thanked me and left, and then we did too. 

The boys obviously noted what house I went into, because not long after i got paid a house call by the mother, screaming at me for ""scaring her kids"". I told her that her son was a complete piece of shit, trying to intimidate toddlers and girls. She said that this wasn't over, and stormed off.

Nothing has since happened, but my wife is saying that I took things too far. I don't agree, given that this brat is a complete bully based on the clear cut examples I've seen today. However, I'm open to criticism.

AITA for not lending my ex-coworker $35?,"A month ago, my ex-coworker Dana (38F) lost her kid. She called me the morning after it happened. I (20M) was stunned. She asked to borrow $30 to make it to the service, as her husband had taken the car. I was naïve and disoriented so I sent her the money. She hasn’t paid me back and she most likely never will. I’m okay with that, her son died and I will never know loss like that. I didn’t mind losing the $30, but what bothered me is that I found out the service was a week after the kid’s death. I have to think that $30 went to something else but I’m not going to ask and I truly don’t want to know.

Today I visited my parents house today to spend some time with my sister for her birthday. Tomorrow we’re going to a theme park to celebrate with her friend, which has been expensive. I also had a doctor’s appt today, which was to fix an issue with hormones in my body. Uninsured, so it cost $135 out of pocket. I also have to get bloodwork done which will cost more money. Medication I need will cost MORE MONEY. Car insurance is also due Monday, so I have a strict budget.

When I get to town, Dana texts me. She and her kids are stranded at a state park back where I live, three hours away. She asks for a lift, and I explain I can’t. She says that no one else—her family included—has responded to her. And that I am the only one able to help. I apologize again and ask if there’s anything I can do. She then asks me for $35 for an Uber back to her house.

I told her I don’t have a lot of money right. I could technically give her $35 and still be ok, but I just don’t want to give her money again if I know I won’t get it back. She offered to pay me back, but I refused. I’m taking of two teenage girls tomorrow at an overpriced theme park, I honestly need every dollar I can use. She says she understands, and I tell her to let me know what happens and if I can do anything else to help.

Within four hours, she says she contacted the non emergency police line and various truckers for help with no luck. She has her three kids in the car with her. She tells this to me and all I say back is that I’m sorry.

She asks me again for money, saying that she’ll pay me back with the stimulus check sitting in her mailbox. Alarm bells start going off in my head. She’s had this stimulus check for at least a month now, she couldn’t have cashed that in earlier?? Wouldn’t she have needed money for the funeral or the service? Even though I’m naïve, this didn’t sit well for me.

I decline once more, and again extend my apologies and tell her to keep me updated. She just sends back K and hasn’t texted me since.

It’s been a few hours and I’ve told my roommate about this. My roommate kind of tore into me, saying that since I don’t understand what she’s going through, the best I can do is send her money in her time of need, especially since I told her I could technically still have the money to give. But idk, I feel like I’m being scammed. AITA?

Real quick edit before bed: Clara and I have been FaceTiming for over an hour and we have fallen into a rabbit hole. We’re having a difficult time finding if her children even EXIST. No obituaries, death reports, birth certificates, NOTHING. Literally going insane right now. Thank you for all the support, I’ll let you know what we find! Current plan is to stake out her house sometime next week. None of us have actually been to her house, met her kids, the only picture we’ve seen of her children looks heavily photoshopped. This woman’s life may be an entire lie :)))

ETA: I was exhausted last night (and still am now, woke up early for theme park) but I wanted to give a bit more info as this kind of blew up overnight.

1. Most of you guys are right, doing a stake out would get me in trouble lol. At the end of the day, it’s none of my business. However…

2. You guys are right again, I’m not the only person she’s bothered for money. Clara has spent $160 on her and has only been paid back for the $60. A lot of other coworkers of mine have been asked for payment between $20-$40, and we’ve all kept it secret from each other under the guise that she didn’t want anyone else to know about her situation. Imagine that. 

3. The managers are aware now, and to my surprise, Dana still TECHNICALLY works with me! I had no idea because I only ever see when I work on the schedule and she hasn’t been in in over a month, but yeah. Now the managers have asked to see her today to discuss her employment. They’re also starting to suspect if her son is dead, let alone if she had children.

4. She told way more lies to different people than she told to me. She told one coworker that her house burned down, another that her daughter was in the hospital, in another story her uncle tried to kill his wife… she told us all about her son but asked us to hide it from each other. The more we started talking to each other, the more I realized how deep this goes.

5. She lied about my involvement in scamming me. She told Clara when asked if I knew about her sons death that I reached out to her and offered her money first. Apparently Dana, being ever so gracious, at first denied my money, and only accepted after I insisted. Like sis, WHAT.

6. When Clara tried to drop off groceries at Dana’s house, Dana asked instead to meet her at a local CVS because she was picking up her daughters insulin and waiting for the prescription to be filled. Which is total BS, my fiancée has type 1 diabetes and the most she’s ever had to wait for insulin is like 10 mins, Dana claims she had been waiting for over a half hour with her daughter. When Clara got there, not only was Dana conveniently waiting outside of the CVS, she was waiting without her young daughter, and didn’t introduce Clara to her, even though they’re close friends.

So yeah, I’ll see how today goes with my managers and what lies she tells them. We never had any invitation to the funeral service, or the memorial, or anything. Clara and I aren’t even completely sure if we ever saw photos of her children or her husband. Due to online records, I know that Dana is married, but it says nothing about any children they may have. We found an insta account that’s private, so we both sent requests and hope that will go somewhere. Yeah yeah, it’s none of my business, and yes I have blocked her already, but guys… how fucked up is it if her entire life story is fake?? I’m fascinated and disturbed and I’m so interested to find out what’s actually going on, even though it is admittedly nosy of me lol.

Thank you all for your judgement. I still feel a bit guilty even with everything that’s come out, since I can’t PROVE she lied to me. I know she definitely did but there’s still a part of me that just hopes I’m wrong. The guilty feeling has definitely gone down but it’s not gone entirely. I definitely know one thing for sure though, I will never lend money again without a follow through, ffs",Not the A-hole

Now yesterday I (31M)got back from a business trip, on the last day before flying I went for a hike and got lost, it took me around 4 hours toxins my way back (I got lost on far out trails, not in the trees) so I was very tired and knew I’d be sore on the day we left.

Flash forward to when we’re at the airport. I was sore. I get to my seat and put my baggage in the overhead and sit down, turns out B was sitting next to me, she struggled to put her baggage up, I didn’t help her because IMO I shouldn’t have to.

WIBTA if I let my boyfriend get scammed,"My boyfriend is currently in the market for a used car. He found one of OfferUp for $1500 and the entire situation with the owner is very sketchy.  

The owner is apparently “in Virginia training on a military base” and needs the car gone by the 18th, before he’s deployed. So he told my boyfriend that if he’s interested to “send him his information” and he would forward it to EBay Motors, so my boyfriend can buy the car from there and get it shipped to him. Apparently they have a 5-day return period. 

Because the seller is “on a military base” he can’t have a cell phone on him, but he’s somehow emailing him back all the time....

I told him it sounds like a scam, and he somewhat brushed me off

This is my boyfriend’s hard earned money that took a long time to save, but this isn’t the first time he’s wasted money on a obvious scam. He has to learn somehow.  WIBTA if I let him finally learn his lesson the hard way?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I (20F) refused to live in my stepsister’s (23F) house while she’s deployed?,"
My stepsister, we’ll call her A, has been doing law enforcement for a few years now and has recently joined the Army. She’s lived in a small fixer-upper near town for a few months now. Being a homeowner at 23 is awesome especially in the states but it wasn’t until a tad later that I began to question the decision. 

Here’s the kicker. My parents (my mom and my stepsister’s dad) have bought a house in the next town over and want to move, maybe 40 minutes. No big deal, shouldn’t be hard for me to find a decent trailer park. Lots of traveling contractors/construction workers in my community so nobody’s ever in one place long enough to cause any trouble. We’ve already driven past one with a laundromat and a pond for fishing and a main building with a pool table, not prone to flooding(a BIG problem in TX all of a sudden, and will hopefully mean bugs are less of an issue, if they’re an issue at all), and fair rent. Called the park and inquired.

HOWEVER I’ve also been “invited” to stay at my stepsister’s house while she’s deployed. Five year contract. It’s a bit bigger and by default her cat and her chickens would be a package deal. The rent is a bit more and the house isn’t entirely finished. It’s definitely liveable, yes, but not ideal. Also has a yard I’d have to mow….. it’s just more than I bargained for. My mother has claimed it would relieve a lot of stress since both she + my stepdad AND my sister wanna move, as they wouldn’t have to worry about packing her things and finding a dependable occupant to pay rent on TOP of their own move. Moving for me is easy, I just have to remove all breakable items from the countertop so they don’t break during transportation and just kinda roll it away. Belongings are all inside. However, I’ve been either WITH my parents or in their backyard literally my whole life (I’m young, not in the house but not fully out of the nest yet) and I feel like it would be better for me to pay my own rent rather than see to my family, because that feels just like living under their roof again. My family are good people but I’m very over that. I see investing in a house right before joining the military as a poor decision and do not feel like I should have to sacrifice my independence (or at least my SENSE of independence) because of it. My mother has said that it’d be no different than a landlord but I’m really not comfortable seeing to my parents, which I’m fairly sure I will if I end up helping B with her mortgage. 

WIBTA if I put my foot down and refused to occupy it while she’s gone, forcing them to put in the extra work? I’m relatively young and this is kinda a big life decision, as it concerns my living space, so I want another perspective. Thanks all in advance.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I skip my grandma's funeral to avoid my parents?,"My grandma died a few days ago. She and I were close. She was the last family member I had left who truly cared about me and wanted the best. And we had talked about her funeral and she gave me permission to miss it but... my aunts say I would be an AH if I don't go.

So stuff with my parents is complicated. I'm their youngest kid together, I had an older brother who died 14 years before I was born. My parents were both young and his death broke them up. But they always kept coming back together, and each time they'd had a kid or two with someone else. In total I have 10 half siblings, four from my mom and six from my dad. I came 13 months after my dad's second youngest kid and I was definitely the black sheep. My half siblings hated how my parents kept coming back together and they hated me for what I represent. Most of them chose to live with their other parent as soon as they could, and the one half sister who couldn't made sure she made my life rougher until she was out. My parents cared more about their relationship than any of their kids. Though I do think they loved my brother and maybe his death is what changed them. All I know is I was the son they had for 18 years and I never felt like they cared.

Now that we're all adults I had hoped... but nobody wants the half brother that represents shit and that is what one of my half brothers told me.

The funeral just seems like it will be a time where I would have to face them, deal with them, and I don't think I'm in a good place to face my parents. My aunts and I aren't at all close either. I was thinking of doing my own celebration.

"AITA for ""fussing"" at my partner for feeding my expensive cat food to his outside cat?","Like the title says, my (31f) partner (36m) is upset with me currently because he says I ""fussed at him"" for feeding his outdoor cat the last of my inside cats expensive cat food. 

My cat requires a special diet, as he's a sphynx with a sensitive stomach, high metabolism, and some skin allergy issues. So, his food is definitely pricey. I've had him for years, and before my partner and I got together, and after trying many many many foods and such, this food has been our saving grace. 

Now, my bf has 2 cats that he's had since before we got together. They were outside cats and eating super cheap food before we got together. (No judgements on the food, my cat just can't eat it) We tried soooooo hard to keep them both inside with my cat, and one of them loves being inside now, but the other just wasn't having it. So the inside one now also eats the food I buy for my cat- which is 100% fine. I don't mind footing that bill so both inside cats are eating the same food, minimizing the risk of my cat eating a different food.

However, his outside cat is his responsibility to feed and care for (although I do spend time with him and feed him if his bowl is empty). 

Anyways, the food in question is auto shipped, and I'm usually cutting it fairly close between shipments, but never actually run out. 

So, I got home yesterday, and I find that my partner had fed the last of this food to his outside cat because he was too lazy to go the store to get his cat food. Which was crazy because it was enough food in the bag for the 2 inside cats to have for dinner and breakfast, and a little leftover in the back. He just poured all of it in the bowl for his cat, I guess so he didn't have to feed him again as soon.  

Obviously I was very disappointed and annoyed at this and I did relatively calmly explain why I was upset about it, and how I can't just run to the store to get food for my cat like he can, so now the inside cats won't have anything to eat for dinner or breakfast. He just didn't get it, and said I was being dramatic and that I could just run to the store for some food for a day. And also made a snide remark about how I treat my cat like a child and he's too spoiled anyway. 

When it comes to my cat- I don't play around. That's my homie, my ride or die. Yes, I go overboard on spoiling him in some ways, but so what? The food isn't me spoiling him- it's literally taking care of him and his issues. 

Anyway, he's mad at me now for fussing at him like hes a child and favoring my cat over his. I don't see how I was wrong here though. I didn't yell, I didn't show anger. He knows my cats digestive system is delicate, he knows why I buy this food, so I calmly reiterated all of these things and went over how this decision will affect both inside cats, including how switching their food so suddenly will give BOTH of them diarrhea, and probably his outside cat will also get diarrhea from a sudden food change.

AITA For Not Wanting To Share My College Fund?,"Throwaway Account

I (19f) have an aunt ""Amy"" (38f) who I love and she loves me dearly. It's never been explicitly stated but between my sister ""Kim"" (17f) and I'm the Favorite Niece. I didn't really notice I was around my early teens but whenever I had an event my aunt would always try to be there while she was never there for anything my sister did. I got nicer presents, there are pictures of me in her house, and she texts/calls me regularly.

She barely acknowledges my sister and I never knew why. One of the reasons why it took so long for me to notice was because whenever someone would mention something about the different treatment our mom would brush it off, and since Amy was my paternal aunt I just accepted it. Fast forward to now and my mom sat me down and asked me if I would be willing to go to a less expensive school so I could have extra money to share with Kim.

Aunt Amy set up a fund for me and my two cousins, but didn't have a dime for Kim. She did this with Kim looking at me for an answer and got upset that I didn't give a definite ""Yes."" She accused me of not caring about her just like Aunt Amy and is refusing to speak to me until I give her half the money. I thought that this was wildly unfair and asked my parents why they didn't have their own fund for Kim since Aunt Amy was taking care of me. They said that they did but it wasn't as much as what Aunt Amy had for me (she's a smart woman who makes a LOT of money) and admitted that they had to dip into it to help pay for things when my dad wasn't working because of COVID.

I feel bad for Kim but I don't want to sacrifice my future college experience for it. Am I really being so maliciously selfish?

ETA: Hey everyone. Sorry I haven't been responding I had to run out and do some errands but I wanted to address some questions/comments.

1. Growing up I did notice that Aunt Amy had a bigger presence in my life and she always had some excuse for not being in Kim's. Ex: I have to work, I have prior commitment that I can't back out of, I'm sick, etc..
2. Yes, growing up I do recall that every now and then me, my cousins or sister would ask why Aunt Amy treated 3/4 of us differently and the adults would act like we were being ridiculous or just brush it off. I always took this as us ""kids"" just making stuff up and would trust that my parents, uncle, uncle's wife, or my paternal grandparents would step in and do something about it. Now that I'm older and starting to look back on things I can now get a better understanding that it was indeed favoritism.
3. No, it has never crossed my mind that I may be my aunt's secret daughter. It also wouldn't explain why she spends time with me and my cousins buy leaves out Kim. If all of the attention was just on me I'd be more inclined to believe it, but for now no.
4. I'm not gonna rule it out 100% but I'm gonna say no to Kim and me having different dads. I am older than her and my parents were already married when I was born. I don't believe that Kim is an affair baby because it doesn't explain why only my Aunt Amy treats her differently. If my entire paternal side treated Kim differently I would feel more inclined to believe it.
5. In regards to the fund itself. I've never actually seen it but I know it's there because my aunt says it's there and my twin cousins are already in college using it. I'm not too sure about the rules of the fund because I just trust my aunt but I will look into it.
6. I'm not saying that I'm unwilling to share ANY of the money. I just don't want to give up half I because I really want to go to my school of choice which is out of state and will be more expensive.
7. One of the main reasons why I was so reluctant was because I felt put on the spot and was being cornered and pressured for an answer, which I resent.

ETA 2: Even though I was out running errands I've given it a lot of thought and think having a sit down with the adults in my life to figure this out may be what's best. ",Not the A-hole
AITA for shutting off the movie half way through and making my boyfriend feel bad?,"My boyfriend (Wyatt) and I always watch movies together every time we have off days that end up on the same day. Especially since the pandemic. And we go back and forth on who picks the movie. But I've noticed he's usually talking through my movie choices. Either pointing out 'plot holes' or just talking down about the movie in one way or another.

I never act this way when it's his turn to pick the movie. Even if I don't care for it. Like the last movie he chose, The Fountain. I was so confused until half way through and then bored the rest of the film. But I didn't talk during the movie or constantly dump on it either. And even at the end when he asked what I thought I said it was alright, even though I thought the movie wasn't good. It tried to do a bunch of different things all at once and ended up doing nothing. But he seemed really fond of it so I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

But he doesn't seem to have that mindset when it comes to him watching my picks. I've told him to shush and to just watch the movies but he just sighs loudly and says they're boring. If I tell him to stop he gets all huffy and goes totally silent and usually takes his phone out to play a game or scroll the internet, totally ignoring me and the movie. It really hurts my feelings.

And yesterday was my turn to choose again, and I picked a good movie that really hit me hard as a kid (I bawled when I first watched it and still tear up to this day). And I told him this movie was special to me but he barely got 10 minutes into it before he started up saying it was boring and childish. It is a kids movie but that doesn't make it boring. I was getting upset and before the big part of the movie even got close I just couldn't take it anymore. I felt like him acting this way during a super important part would ruin the movie for me, maybe forever, so I just got up and turned it off.

He asked what I was doing and I told him I didn't want to have the movie ruined for me so it was better if I just turn it off. He said I was being a baby and to turn it back on. I refused and just told him to pick something to watch instead, then I sat on the couch. He got mad and said if I was gonna be dramatic like this then he didn't want to watch anything with me and got up and went to his room and slammed the door.

This happened the other day and he's been giving me the cold should and when I asked why he said he wants an apology for making him feel like dirt. Should I apologize? Did I really make a huge deal out of just a movie? AITA?

**I've gotten a LOT of comments and IMs asking what the movie I chose was. It was The Bridge to Terabithia. It's not the best movie ever but it was the first 'kids' movie I watched when I was young that really moved me and made me cry.**

**/**

**Uh hey. Final(?) edit. I ended up having to call my parents who called the cops on Wyatt.**

**I read all the advice from everyone saying he wasn't respecting my interests or me as a person and it got me thinking and stuff I ignored or overlooks before started popping out to me. Stuff that didn't seem fair to me that I'd just put up with because I loved him. And so many people told me to just break up with him and I could do better. But I was in love and he was my first serious boyfriend, and I really just wanted to work things out and get through this thing with him.**

**So I tried to sit down and have a serious talk with him, just hoping he'd listen this time. I told him how he acted made me feel and his behavior during my movie choices ruined the experience for me. And I told him I never act that way during his movies because I know he likes them and I respect him and don't want to be mean or belittle his interests, even if they don't interest me. About then he told me I was being dramatic again and they were just stupid movies and he tried excusing his behavior by saying my movie choices suck anyways.** 

**I was just so tired by this point and wanted some space and quiet to think about where we go from here. So I started to ask him to go back to his apartment for the night but he interrupted me by yelling how since I couldn't have my way I was kicking him out. It really scared me because he'd never screamed at me before, even when he'd raise his voice during arguments he never full on screamed at me. I tried to get him to calm down but he started calling me a bunch of nasty stuff and even backed me up against a wall and grabbed my bicep hard enough to bruise I saw later, I panicked and ran to the bathroom and locked it behind me.** 

**He banged on the door, telling me to come out and I was crying and couldn't think of anything else to do but call my parents. Mom answered and she could hear him screaming and the banging in the background. Her and dad were freaked out and dad called the cops. Long story short the cops and my folks showed up and Wyatt was removed from my apartment and my parents told him not to come back or we'd get a restraining order.** 

**It's almost 10:30pm now and I've locked my apartment up and am currently staying with my mom and dad for a while. Thanks for the advice everyone. But Wyatt and I are pretty much over and I think I'm done with this account and I'll be logging off now.**",Not the A-hole
AITA for expecting my fiance to take care of home responsibilities before hanging with friends/family,"My fiance and I have been together for 5 years. We're in our late 20s/early 30s and have lived together for 4 years. He's a wonderful partner for the most part, but I feel like he has a blind spot. He says that myself and our pets are his ""family"" and ""top priority"" but if friends/family want something, all of our agreed-upon boundaries (and in my opinion, some common sense/common courtesy) kind of goes out the window.

most recent examples:

Our dog is sick and it's a holiday weekend, so the vet's office is closed, but before they closed they said to keep a close eye on her and bring her to the emergency vet immediately if she vomits again. My fiance's cousin invites him over for dinner. He asks if I want to come and I say no because someone needs to stay home with our dog. And tell him that I'd prefer if he sees his cousin another time instead because if we have to go to the emergency vet an hour away, I'd prefer if we do that together. He goes to his cousin's house because he hasn't seen him in a while and feels he should go. 

Our dog ends up getting an endoscopy a few weeks later. His parents have a party for their friends that night and his mom calls to ask him to come over. My fiance wants to bring our dog. She throws up as soon as she stands up. I say no, she's not going, but you go ahead. He decides to bring his friend over and they proceed to get high and drunk, which is uncommon for my fiance. Despite the fact that I asked him to stay in the backyard and please not let his friend stay too late, they come into the house to make food and his friend doesn't leave 'til 1AM. Our dog is uncomfortable around strangers and isn't feeling well, the friend crosses boundaries with her, and my fiance doesn't say anything or ask his friend to stop.

My fiance had a 3-day weekend, but I did not. His friends are at a lakehouse an hour away and invite him over around noon. He said his plan was to leave by 5 and do all of his ""house chores"" that he'd put off all weekend when he got home. But then he sits around using his phone for a while. Finally at 2, he asks if we can talk. We proceed to argue for an hour because he wanted me to ""understand"" his thinking about going to see his friends. I had no issue with him going, but he's always worried about upsetting people and he projected that on me (which he did acknowledge). BUT the fact that he suddenly decided to leave 3 hours later did bother me because there was no way he'd be able to get home by 5 and take care of his responsibilities around the house.

&#x200B;

To me, our household comes first - so if our dog is sick, or if I have responsibilities to take care of at home, that's more important to me than a casual visit with my friends and family members. I feel that by doing these things, he's showing me where his priorities lie, but he insists that our household is his priority and I just don't view friendship the same way he does.

WIBTA for not inviting my cousins,"throwaway. 

So some backstory:   
A while ago my sister (f27) and I (f22) invited our cousins, Penny (f14) and Moe (m11) to come stay with us for a weekend to celebrate a cultural holiday. We always make sure our younger sister Zoe (f11) is a good host and includes them in all the fun activities.   

During the second day of their visit, Penny had a horrible stomach Ache, and after taking her to the doctor, we found out she had appendicitis. We then had the appendix removed, and they stayed for another week so that Penny could heal.   

After Penny was healed, we sent them back home and all was well. A short while after this, my mom decides to go visit them and takes Zoe along since the kids are all good friends. They have a nice time until suddenly our Uncle decides to take only his kids out for McDonalds but leaves Zoe behind. They don’t even invite her to go out with them. My mom takes this up with our our aunt, who then speaks to her husband (our uncle), and uncle just gets MAD at my mom and starts a fight. My mom and Zoe leave and they come back home. When I hear about this, I am livid! I resent them because of their treatment of Zoe.   

Skip forward to today:   
Penny and Moe are now visiting my mom per mom’s invite. It’s all good, but a week ago we planned that Zoe was coming to me for the weekend. She still is, but I’m being asked to invite the cousins. I honestly don’t want to. Aside from teh fact that they so rudely excluded Zoe last time, I can’t really take care of three kids at such short notice. I was gonna take Zoe out to have fun and can’t afford to take 2 more kids.  

I’m very protective of Zoe. She has been nothing but good and kind, and they repaid that by excluding her which I feel like I can’t accept.

AITA for telling my mom i need new shoes?,"I'm 17f, I live with my mother and younger sister, 11f. We live below the poverty line so there are very few luxuries in our life, especially with my mom still being out of work over the panoramic. 

So, I want to say that every year at the beginning of the school year, my sister and I would normally get a new pair of shoes. Those are our everything shoes. Destroy em and it's on us, we're not getting another pair until the nearest September. Sometimes we'd get them off family members or if we asked for them for Christmas. 

Last September, my mom couldn't afford new shoes for the school year so we made do. My sisters are still pretty ok, her school walk is closer to the house than mine and she doesn't go out as much as I tend to. Mine are falling apart in every which way.

My mom and I were walking to the recycling centre the other day and a piece of glass slipped in between one of the holes and cut my foot. Mom asked if I was okay to which I responded with ""I'm fine but I think I could need new shoes"", 

in a tone that implied I do need them but I can wait as long as need be.

AITA for not letting mil have her husband over?,"I have 2 sons (3&4) and a daughter (1). My boys are both have autism and my oldest also has ADHD and epilepsy. Because of this I am a little bit of a “helicopter mom”. I’m just trying to do my best like every other lol. 

Well my mother in law (who babysits our kids while we work) recently got married to a man she didn’t know for very long. They were married within less than a year of meeting, which is her choice, no judgement! Since they got married my mother in law has been really pushing us to get to know him and is constantly talking about how great of a guy he is. She’s really trying to push the “grandpa of the year” agenda with us and all over social media. However her husband has made it very clear he doesn’t care for my boys at all. He gets visibly frustrated any time my kids have meltdowns or are just being a little loud. He’s raised his voice at my oldest son almost every time he’s come around. I don’t take kindly to anyone raising their voice at my kids. He seems to think I don’t discipline them enough.

Anyway, I’ve told my mother in law I don’t want her having company over while I’m at work because 1.) that’s my house and I’m just weird about that stuff and 2.) I had some things happen to me as a child so I don’t let my kids around just anyone. 

Come to find out she’s been letting her husband come over to hang out while we’re working. I had my husband have a chat with her about it and all hell broke loose. She seems to think because he’s  family, we shouldn’t care. She didn’t show up today to watch the kids so my husband had to call out. She said we’re on a power trip and that it isn’t fair because we let my step dad watch the kids. (Which is true but my stepdad raised me and I trust him more than I trust anyone) basically it’s causing a ton of drama and I feel bad for my husband who is getting text from her every few hours about how he hurt her feelings. I have no clue if I’m a crazy helicopter mom or if she’s being unreasonable.

AITA for going on an outing without my partner?,"I, (M21) have been together with my partner (F22) for about two years now. For a bit of background, my partner and I live in two different cities and so we are only able to meet up maybe once or twice a week. This past week however, I told my partner that I did not want to meet up as the gas prices were extremely high and as the primary driver between the two of us  (she doesn't drive), I felt that my request was reasonable. To my relief, my partner was extremely understanding and made other arrangements to hangout with our close mutual friend group. Things were going fine until I found out that my partner and our friends were going to watch a movie that we were both dying to watch. As a result, I began to feel a bit of FOMO and told my partner that I wanted to see her after all. Without missing a beat, my partner immediately cancelled on our friends and began to get ready for our meeting. At the same time, one of our mutual friends messaged me to ask if I was interested in taking my partner's place since they had already purchased a ticket for her. I agreed and told my partner that I was going to see the movie with our friends. She then got extremely mad at me and said that had I told her earlier, she could have transited and made it in time for the movie as well. Now, the only way for her to make it in time would be for me to drive and pick her up. However, I reminded her that I initially didn't want to pick her up due to the distance between us as well as high gas prices. In the end, I went to the movie without her as I felt that it would have been a waste of a ticket and that my partner should have known how badly I wanted to watch the movie. Now that the movie is over, I have been trying to reach my partner but she has not read any of my messages.

AITA for putting a stipulation on a request for my in laws?,"So recently my husband and I have just bought our 1st home. We originally were renting the property but our landlords decided to sell since the market is so well right now. We have an autistic son and receives therapies in home as well as outpatient so it was just easier to buy the place rather than find a new place.  We got a call from my in-laws wanting to see our son and so we scheduled for the following day after closing to go over. Now, I don't have the best relationship with my in laws we have gotten into a lot of fights over the years over just random stuff and I know that they don't like me. But I usually put it aside so much put it aside so my husband can have a relationship with them and just keep my thoughts to myself. So, we went to my in-law’s house where my in-law stated that she can no longer afford daily expenses since the market is going higher and higher and would like to move in with us. They wanted the master suite so they can renovate it to their liking and put in a door so they could go in-and-out like a mother in law suite . I was fine with the idea. Since my husband was concerned and they could get closer to my son since they don't really have a relationship. When we asked how long they would need to stay for my in-law stated till death. With my son having autism and having all the therapies he has now once he starts school, we don't know how public school is going to work for him. We live in a rural area where there is not much, some of his therapies that can't be in home are over an hour away that we make trips twice a week for. Once he starts school if he is severe, we're going to need to put him possibly in a private school, where he can flourish more since he needs 1 on 1 attention. So, this gives us about 3 years. Yesterday we talked to my in laws and discussed with them that there's a possibility  that in 3 years we will need to move since my son may not flourish in public school  and may need more 1 on 1  time which would make us move more towards the city. We stated to them we don't know if we would be able to afford a home with all the bedrooms we have now (4/2) in the city especially with paying possible tuition costs depending on if he is more severe than he is now.   We stated that our plan would be either to sell the property or to rent the main part of the home to someone and for them to keep their in law suite and stay on property. This was also based on what if, not a definite since we don't know the future and can't say whether or not our son is going to get more severe only time can actually tell us. This made my in-law extremely furious; she was screaming how we are putting a good school for our son over her living Stability. Also, she already bought a pod and ceiling fans.  Now it's only been a couple weeks that we actually told her OK. And we're not saying she can't move in for the years that we're here, ( bill free).

I mostly figured that it was to babysit their two kids while they lived it up but maybe a week later...another thought occured to me. That they probably wouldn't stay in a hotel due to Covid and wanted someone to split the hotel costs.

&#x200B;

Closer to the trip, when my mom told me the breakout of funds and the amount. I grew suspicious. Everything seemed overinflated. Also she has money alloted for places that are free to visit. I work in finance and part of my job is look at travel fees. My company basically lets people stay wherever and rent whatever car and these fees were over these amounts.

&#x200B;

So I told my mother, hey you are being taken advantage of...next time they ask you to go somehere don't just ask to see a spreadsheet created by them but actual receipts for payment to places.

&#x200B;

My mom seemed upset but resigned, I guess I gave your sister a trip for free and now your brother.

&#x200B;

AITA for telling her? Should I have kept my mouth shut?  My mother is upset with me.  She says that I made her feel bad about herself.  I am critical of them when they treat her badly.  But I feel like she comes to me to vent about them and then gets upset when I validate that they are not nice to her.  I think she feels bad because she doesn't stand up for herself and takes it out on me when I bring the obvious to her attention.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not want my mother to move in with me after promising to do so?,"A bit of background: I(f26) used to live with my mother(f55) until I decided to move from Brazil to England, my plan was that I'd live and work here until I was settled and then I'd bring her to live with me.

My mom divorced my mentally abusive father about 8 years ago and since then it has been only the two of us, with little family support.
In the begging she suffered for not being able to get a job and depression what made me have to start working by the age of 17, and postpone studying. (My father did pay for childcare but it wasn't nearly enough), she later manage to get a job as a cashier what made it possible for me to save enough money to move to England (because I had multiple jobs).

While I was here I'd send her some money but she mostly manages to live by her own means now (but very frugally), and because of that I was able to study (bootcamp) and get a good job this last year.

The plan was for me to bring her to move in by the end of this year but because of some settle backs I don't have the money yet to afford it.

But the thing is, she still want to come regardless she says that once she is here she will get a job and help me with the bills, but even though I know she is a very hardworking woman, she doesn't speak any English and I know it will be an issue for her to find anything right now, and with my current salary I can't afford for two people and a cat to live in London.

I've talked to her and asked for more time untill I'm able to save some more money to afford bring her (ticket, housing and a few months of job searching).

But the truth is I'm enjoying living by myself, not to have to worry or care for her, and I don't want to have the responsibility of take care of her again. (Because after marriage she became extremely dependent even for simple choices).

And because of the cat I might need to rent a whole place for us, what is extremely expensive in London on top of that.

AITA for leaving my mom alone in our home country?

AITA For Yelling at My Dad For Not Telling Me About His Boyfriend,"Throwaway account. Sister knows main. I know the title sounds bad but hear me out. Long post. TL:DR at bottom.

I (16M) made a mess of everything, but I feel like I'm justified. My sister ""Wendy"" (16F) feels different.

Quick Background: I got kicked from the track team because my grades dropped too low. After getting lectured by my dad (36M), he started trying to find me a tutor. So far 3 tutors have given up on me.

My dads favorite is my sister. I mean, I get it. Straight A student, nice, pretty, never gotten detention, yadda yadda. She looks and acts like a younger version of my dad. I’m the complete opposite. They always tell each other everything, so I'm usually outta the loop until the very last minute. Don't get me wrong, he's a great dad. A lotta people have it worse. I just know I'm not top priority and that sucks sometimes.

Story:

I started seeing ""Michael"" (34—36 ish probably, M) last month as a tutor. My dad said he was an old friend of his. I expected to hate him and for him to realize I was hopeless. But he was actually kinda cool.

Instead of studying immediately, he wanted to talk. Get to know me. I told him about track and field and my music collection — I'm a HUGE fan of old music. I got this awesome, giant poster of Diana Ross, and a big CD collection (a lot of Olivia Newton-John and Billy Joel, to name a few, and of course Diana Ross, the coolest. I also got this wicked George Michael jacket that I wear everywhere). We also talked about my family for a bit, he seemed to really like my dad.

Eventually after about a month or so of this, Mike came over for dinner. He brought me a Cyndi Lauper CD, and brought Wendy a poster of this anime character with demon eyes and pink hair and horns. She got *super* excited.

So. After dinner, Michael and Wendy went upstairs so he could help her hang up her poster. Then my dad wanted to talk. He asked what I thought about Michael. I said he was cool and was in the middle of explaining what I was studying with him (Hamlet) when dad dropped the “we’re dating” bombshell.

My brain short circuited for a second as all the pieces flew together. Its like Mike was only nice to me so my dad would be happy.

I asked for how long and he said a couple months. I asked why he was telling only me, and he said Wendy already knew. That was a kick to the stomach.

A huge yelling match occurred. Mike came down looking embarrassed and left.

I do feel bad about that. I like Mike, and upon reflection I think he and my dad are good together. I havent seen my dad this happy in a while. I'm not mad that they're together, I'm mad everyone lied to me.

Later Wendy came in my room and called me an asshole. We had an argument; Mean words were exchanged. My dad arrived and surprise surprise, took her side.

After more screaming, I locked myself in my room. Wendy and Dad ganging up on me I'm used too, but I don't want Mike to hate me.

TL;DR: My dad and my sister both were lying to me and I got mad when I found out.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit

(LOOOOONG UPDATE):

Wow. I was blown away by all the kind comments. A few brought me to tears. Thank you.

I've read all your thoughts and responded when I could. I realize I wasn't completely in the wrong, but I still could have handled better.

The first thing I did was send Mike an email. Here's an excerpt from that email:

""I'm sorry for how I acted at dinner the other night. I was angry at my father for keeping something from me and only me (which tends to happen a lot). My dad and sister have a special bond and I often feel pushed to the side, and this was ""the straw that broke the camels back."" This explains my outburst, but doesn't excuse it. I apologize for putting you in that position. I appreciate you helping me study. I like you a lot, and I'm cool with you guys dating, but I feel hurt I was the only one who didn't know. I felt betrayed and like you only wanted to get to know me to make my dad happy.""

I wrote a similar letter to my dad, stressing that the favoritism hurt me really bad and I didn't like being left out of everything. I understand they have a bond because they're so similar, but I wanted a relationship with him, too. I pointed out how he often times sided with Wendy (like the other night) and that made me feel like an afterthought and further reinforced in my mind that she was the favorite. I put the note in his office where he would see it when he got home from work that night.

After I got home from babysitting yesterday, I saw Mike had responded to my email. We talked for a little bit. Mike essentially apologized and explained the situation from his pov (though he made it clear he wasn't trying to excuse his behavior). He said he wasn't trying to get to know me just for my dad and that he likes me, too. Mike also said that he and his little sister were raised by a single parent, and felt like when she remarried, she and his step-dad always favored their step-brother, so he understands how I feel. He said that emotions and communication can be difficult (especially with my dad) and offered to help me talk to him. I politely declined.

Later, my dad got home from work and found my letter. He immediately came downstairs to my room (like, didn't even change out of his uniform first, which is unheard of) and asked if really felt this way.

I said yes. He sat down next to me and started *crying*. I mean full on sobbing. I've never seen his man let out a single macho man tear before. So I was just kinda like ??? Huh ??? What do I do ?? Did I break him ???

He apologized for making me feel left out and like an afterthought, and that he hadn't realized how he was making me feel. We talked for a while.  I kind of just talked in circles and repeated what I said in my note, but he listened.  He's open to me starting therapy, hesitated when I brought up family therapy, but said that he'd try it.

Then Wendy came home from work. My dad and I talked so long I lost track of time. She came downstairs when she heard us talking, and I said that we were speaking privately, and then she got super defensive saying that she deserves to be included too (ironic) and started complaining about me again.But then!! My dad shut! her! down!

He said that we were having a private conversation, and if she wanted to talk later they could, but I needed to say some things right now. Her face went all surprise Pikachu, looked at my dad to make sure he was serious, and then just went upstairs.

Here's some stuff that I found out:

1. When I started seeing Mike as a tutor, he and my dad hadn't started dating yet. They dated each other briefly in college, but stopped when Mike moved back to Europe, where he's from (we live in North America). He moved back up here earlier this year to help his sister with some stuff. He and my dad started talking, and Mike agreed to help tutor me (he was already tutoring some kids in the area). Dad and Mike started dating a few weeks later.
2. Mike's sister has a kid ""Jack"" (15M) who goes to my school. I know *of* Jack but I don't know him. However, he takes an AP class with my sister, and they started talking. Apparently Jack recognized her last name, they spoke, and he told Wendy that Mike and dad used to date. She figured the rest out from there.
3. When Wendy confronted my dad about it, he asked her not to tell me. (my dad admitted this wasn't okay and he should have told me once she knew).

My dad and I are gonna start doing stuff together. He offered to come with me on my morning jogs to ""hang out"" so we'll see?

I'm no longer seeing Mike as a tutor. Both my dad and Mike agreed that I improved enough that I can study independently (thank you whoever suggested Khan Academy) at least until school starts back up. Then we'll reevaluate and if I'm okay with it, I'll start studying with Mike again.

Mike's gonna come over to dinner tonight, and he's gonna bring his sister and nephew so we can all officially meet.

Wendy still isnt talking to me.

Edit 2:

I'm getting tested for ADHD. Apparently my mom got diagnosed with it about a year before she died. 

Also, as it turns out, while Wendy looks and acts just like my dad, apparently I'm the spitting image of my mom?? How crazy it that?? She apparently collected records and went to concerts all the time!!",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I called out my sister for being snobby?,"For context, me and my sister haven’t had the best relationship, ever. She’s always been borderline abusive to me for years on end. We’ve been trying to mend our relationship and so we took our partners, my husband and her boyfriend to Daytona Beach. A few days into the trip, he proposed to her on the beach. She acted all happy in the moment, but the boys left for a second to get pizza for all of us and she scoffed and said “where’s the bling?” I shrugged and said “money is tight, we’re in a pandemic, don’t expect the world right now.” She just sighed and said “I get that, but like, I’m gonna be his wife… can’t he splurge a bit? I want your engagement ring.”
I’m now getting a bit defensive Bc I know my husband worked his ass off at Amazon to pay for my ring (did not ask him to do this) and her boyfriend’s on thin ice as it is mental health wise… Amazon’s not a nice place.
“Well, we’ve dated for 7 years… he’s been saving up for this ring for 3. He wanted to propose now-“
They came back. Her fiancé is oblivious, and my husband is confused why I’m avoiding my sister. Would I be the asshole if I told my Husband and my sister’s boyfriend what’s going on?
Edit: thank you for the input. I have calmed down from the situation, and I decided to let him figure it out on his own. If he wants to marry someone like that, it’s up to him, and I need to be the bigger person. Thanks Reddit!",Asshole
Aita for ruining my moms door?,"I (21f) was watching as the man who has been working on different projects around our new house was attempting to open my moms bedroom door, after she locked it during a party we had last night and didn’t realize we don’t have the key. I watched for about 20 minutes but he had his back turned towards me and was inches away from the door. When he left downstairs to grab some more tools I looked closely at the door because I was standing about 6ft away I realized the wood all around the door handle was broken and there was a large crack in the doorframe. When he got back I asked him to stop working on the door because of the damage and texted my mom photos. She called me and cursed me out and blamed it all on me
for letting him do that and I completely understand where i’m wrong in this for not catching it while he worked but I don’t think it’s all on me when he has been working on our house for months and is familiar with the fragile wood and didn’t mention how damaged the area was getting.

AITA for telling my friend that he has to take his kids' weight gain seriously?,"Me and my friend(both 45M) are both doctors, and we've been close friends since med school. We both moved away from where we studied and have made proper lives for ourselves, so we don't see each other that often anymore. A week or two ago, I was visiting his city and he invited me home for dinner with his family. 
He has two kids, 19M and 15M. I've known them both since they were born, and they're both great kids.
When I visited them though, I was genuinely surprised. These kids are *severely* obese, to the point where they're completely unrecognizable to me. The older one is apparently around 100kgs, and cannot get up by himself if he sits on the floor. When we were eating, I noticed that their diet mostly consisted of unhealthy, fast food. I brought it up later on when the two of us were alone in a car. He said that this is what dinner normally looks like.
Apparently, his wife pampers these kids a LOT and lets them eat whatever they want at any time. Now I was brought up in an Indian household by parents who were very strict about my diet being healthy, and I make sure that my own children are always eating healthy. I don't restrict them from eating fast food, but I always explain to them the importance of not overdoing it. So you can imagine my surprise when this man tells me that his kids eat burgers/pizzas etc EVERYDAY. I see a lot of patients with severe heart problems, and I know how bad childhood obesity can be, so I simply reminded him that him and I both know how serious this can get in the future. I told him that he should try to get them to eat healthy. He seemed to agree with me on everything, even asking me about how to go about it, so I got him in touch with a nutritionist friend of mine in the same city and suggested some basic exercises and such that he can look into until he gets in touch with professionals at a hospital.
A few days ago, I got messages from some mutual friends asking me what I'd done. Apparently, he had proposed the idea of a healthier lifestyle to his wife, and she basically blew up in his face. He didn't mention me at all, but she pieced together that I had done something, since my field does involve dealing with obesity and its effects sometimes. She's been bad mouthing me ever since, telling everyone that I tried to control their lives just to flaunt my degree (which I don't really understand, how is me suggesting healthier options a bad thing?)

I understand that it was technically not my place to advise them since I'm not their family doctor, but they've never been to doctors for a checkup in recent years.
I never ordered them to do anything, I worded everything as a suggestion. I was simply worried about the kids. I still get why they'd be pissed though, and my wife is asking me to apologize which I'm absolutely ready to do.

AITA for not wanting to spend time with my dad anymore,"I (14f) have always had an amazing relationship with my dad since i was a little kid but our relationship has became strained mostly because of me. My parents are divorced and my mom has 100% custody of me and my dad lives in another state, my dad would visit me but would only visit me about 2 times a year and then i wouldn't hear from him for about another year the longest I've gone without seeing him is about 3-4 years, I always gave him the benefit of the doubt say to myself ""Well he has a job and is busy most of the time."" i kept saying this to myself until about 2 years ago. I don't feel like he deserves a father role since he's never really been in my life or acted like a father to me, when we hang out all he only asks me about school and nothing else. When i try to ask about his life he only tells me a little bit, just a week ago i found out my mom was his 2nd wife, i get that he might not be comfortable telling me about his past marriage but it did hurt that i found out through my mom rather than through him. He even lied to me about why my mom and him got a divorce, told me they had a ""disagreement"" when really he cheated on my mom twice.

Now that I'm going in to high school in 3 weeks he's been trying to get into contact with me more but i keep finding excuses not to talk to him and wanting to see me again but i just can't do it. I just don't feel comfortable being around him anymore. My mom wants me to give him another chance but i feel that it's entirely up to me whether to give him another chance or not.

AITA for letting a teacher chew my mom out,"I (f17) missed the majority of my freshman year due to being in the hospital. I didn’t have a 504 at first and a lot of my teachers failed me for not being able to work while I was in the hospital. I’m making those classes up in summer school right now.

My school uses this program called edgenuity for summer school. For anyone who’s not familiar with it, it’s a self study/independent learning/work at your own pace program that allows you to work at any time of the day.

My school recommends that we work 3-5 hours a day and we are required to go to a 30 minute check in meeting with a teacher every day. 

My mom seems to think that I’m done with school after the meeting and makes me go out with her and my sister for the whole day after. If I don’t go out, she takes my laptop so I can’t work anyway. We come home around dinner but by then I’m exhausted (I’m not as sick as I used to be but I’m still not healthy) and usually take a nap before doing an hour of school and going to bed. 

At my check in meeting on Monday, my teacher told me I was falling behind and asked if everything was okay. I told her what was going on and she emailed my mom and asked to set up a meeting. 

They had a meeting yesterday and my mom kept insisting that there’s no way I’m behind because I go to every meeting. My teacher told my mom that I have to put in 3-5 hours of work before/after the meeting and my mom said I can’t do that because we have plans this summer and how am I supposed to “go out and have fun” (her words, I’d much rather stay home) if I’m supposed to work for 3-5 hours. 

Well, my teacher didn’t like that she said that and chewed her out for forcing me to go out and for not letting me work. 

My mom’s mad at me for letting her chew her out and for not telling her the teacher was upset with her and that she wouldn’t have scheduled the meeting if she knew. 

I feel bad for telling the teacher what happened and she’s still mad at me so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not being the cook at my girlfriend BBQ.,"My girlfriend (28f) and I (30m) have been going out for 5 years. We bought a house last year and due to COVID, we were not able to have a real house warming party.

She decided to invite her friend so we can have a house warming party. She asked me if i could be the cook at the bbq, as im always in charge of that side of cooking in our house. I simply asked her to post a poll to ask what everyone wanted to eat. Im a hunter, im a fisherman, my choice of menu is not a crowd pleaser. I dont mind cooking hot dog and hamburger,  but i prefer to cook pike and bear meat. Also, for having cooked for her friend before, i know some of them are notoriously picky.

We are now a few days from the event, and i asked her what the result of the poll were. She told me, she never sent it, to just cook whatever i wanted. I told her that i would make moose burger. To me its the highest delicacy i can serve to a guest. She then told me that her friends would not like that and to find something else.

I tend told her i resigned as a cook. If she want me to start the gas grill or the smoker, i dont mind, but i wouldnt do any actual cooking.

AITA for making my former stepson my priority during my visitation with him?,"EDITED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS:

I raised my former step son from birth through the first seven years of his life. I was the only father he knew until his mother and I divorced and she elected to track down his biological father for child support. When she found him and he agreed to pay her in exchange for partial custody she began to restrict my time with my step son. Things got worse when I was awarded full custody of my biological son with her after she was arrested for child abuse. She and my step son’s biological father shut off all contact between my step son and I. I petitioned to the court and, after over a year, I was awarded limited visitation with him against the wishes of his biological parents. I was awarded a total of 12 hours a month, spread across three days. It’s not much, but it’s better than nothing. 

Lately this visitation has been a point of contention between my wife and I. She gets upset that I don’t make myself completely available for her during my visits with my step son. It seems to me that I’m with her before and after the visits and it’s not too much to ask to get as much one on one time as I can out of the four hour period I have with my step son. Am I the asshole for making my stepson the priority over giving attention to my wife during these visits?


____________________________________________

Hi all! I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed by the number of reactions here. I just wanted to try and address some of the INFO requests and a couple other things. 

-I have full legal custody of my biological son, his half brother, but my ex wife still has visitation. It happens that her visitation with my biological son falls during my visit with my step son. I’m not just leaving him out. Also, my wife is frequently invited to come with us when we go to activities. 

-I absolutely consider my stepson my son, I’m just using the term stepson for clarity. 

-No emergencies have happened. This is referencing things like phone calls while I’m out with him. If we are out doing an activity, for instance, my wife seems to be of the opinion that I can chat with her about day to day things the entire time and she’s upset when I don’t text back or call back right away. If he and I are making dinner together, I don’t want to walk away to talk to her for 20 minutes about something on Facebook, etc. 

-To be clear…we both work full time. I work at night and I’m home during the day. I am the person who does primary care, daycare pickup/drop off, makes meals, etc. This isn’t a situation where she’s doing it all on her own and then I’m disappearing. 

-My wife is not insane and she’s not a bad person. I think she just struggles with this relationship a bit. She has been by my side and helped me to get this visitation. I love her endlessly and know she’d never try to stop the visitation from happening.

-The visits are during weekday afternoons, not weekends.",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to take care of the dog my wife promised to take care of?,"My wife (32F) and I (33M) have a pretty open and accepting relationship. A few weeks ago, my wife brought home a dog without even asking me first and told me that he had been abandoned on the streets and she couldn't let him go, so after taking him to the vet and ensuring he would be safe to keep around our kids (7F) and (5M), I agreed that we could keep him but that my wife would be the one caring for him, and she agreed.  My wife is very responsible so I didn't have any reason to doubt her. 

But now my wife is upset that I'm not caring for the dog. I've done things like opening the door for him when he wants outside when my wife isn't home but that's about it, but she's upset because I wait for her to feed him in the mornings and she's not an early riser, so she thinks that I should take responsibility for feeding the dog because she has trouble waking up. But I didn't want the dog in the first place and told her that it's her job and we both agreed to it. 

She called me a jerk and told me that I was acting like a child, and that I just needed to feed the dog once in the mornings, but that wasn't part of the agreement. But my wife is pretty upset and I want to see if she's really right about this, I don't want to argue with her and I could be wrong about this.",Not the A-hole
AITA for deciding I don’t want a relationship with my father anymore?,"I (42m) have a strained relationship with my father. Backstory, my parents were teenagers when they had me. They married and divorced in short time. My father went on to marry a couple of more times and I have half siblings from each of his marriages. The youngest is my 25f sister. 

I didn’t meet my father until I was 30. I have 2 young children of my own (7f, 4f) that I enjoy he has been a part of their life. However, if my sister can’t or isn’t able to come along, he doesn’t ever show. Whether the plans were just with him or not, he cancels or just doesn’t show. 

My sister is his youngest and spoiled rotten. If we’re visiting together, regardless of where, she always has to be in charge. If they visit my place and we all decide to have Subway she will throw a tantrum that she doesn’t want that and has to have (insert anything different). If we make plans and she can’t come he has to cancel because my sister is extremely jealous and will cuss him out and start a fight if he comes without her. 

I understand he doesn’t want to deal with all of that, but he’s my father too. Sometimes it would be fun to catch a game or grab a drink, just the 2 of us or if he came over by himself just to see his granddaughters. 

So my wife and I were hosting Thanksgiving and invited my father and sister. We had invited some other people as well. My father cancelled last minute because my sister does not like one of my cousins. I told him just to come over for a little bit while she’s at her moms. He never responded. About 2 months ago he finally sent me a text and I just never responded. I just don’t want the hassle. Spending time with my father shouldn’t be such a pain in the ass. My world does not and will not revolve around my sister. I have tried to have conversations with him several times explaining how I feel. He always responds that he’s sorry, but my sister is like his sidekick and always goes where he goes. I know that’s total bullshit because he takes a guys trip with some of his buddies every year to a different ballpark and she doesn’t go. 

Am I the asshole for deciding to just continue on without him in my life? I haven’t informed him of my decision, but I’m much happier without the stress and hassle that comes with my sister’s presence.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my relative to grow up and stop faking medical conditions?,"My relative says she has spine problems, heart problems, allergies, cell problems etc. Once she claimed cancer but backed off since there was no proof. She takes more than the recommended amount of opiods and when she can't get a prescription she gets them illegally. 

Before this started she was thin, she had a job, drove, went to school, was independent. She got married right when this started. Her husband says they have never had sex or any kind of affection since they married because she doesn't want to and that he is her caregiver and not a spouse. Their relationship was normal before they got married. My relative claims she can't eat and needs a feeding tube to survive. There's video of her eating. She has gained AT LEAST 200 lbs. But according to her it is water weight swelling and not fat. She visited at least a dozen doctors before one gave her the tube and she had to pay in cash because insurance refused to cover it.

My relative also says she can't walk but she does it all the time and there is video. They took out a loan to buy her an electric wheelchair because no doctor would sign off. It doesn't even fit her properly because without a sign off and insurance she couldn't get a custom one. She also refuses to wear pants. She only wears shirts, underwear and socks. She says no pants fit her and they are uncomfortable. She goes out in public without pants. She buys epi-pens from the internet because she says she has allergies. She claims to be allergic to air, to certain people (not perfume they wear or stuff like that) but actual people and to dozens of other things. No doctor would confirm her allergies.

Normally I ignore her. I don't financially support her so I figure it's none of my business. I don't comment and keep in as little contact as possible. It came to head because I just got married. My wedding got delayed because of the pandemic. We got married outdoors with 20 guests plus us, the officiant and the photographer. We plan to throw a reception later once the pandemic has calmed down. We sent video and photos to anyone who couldn't be present. My relative threw a tantrum when she found out. She got mad the wedding was at the beach because her wheelchair doesn't work on sand but 1) she wasn't invited and 2) she can walk, there is recent video on her social media of her walking on sand at the same beach. We hadn't planned to invite her to the reception. The reception will be at my in-law's place because they have a big yard. My relative is upset because she says her wheelchair doesn't work on grass but again she can walk. She can walk to a chair. 

She has called me all names and says I am an asshole and a horrible person for being ableist. When she threw the tantrum I told her to grow up and stop faking medical conditions she doesn't have. I normally don't comment but I was mad. Should I have been more sensitive to her and not said what I said?",Not the A-hole
AITA for reminding my family how did they call me fat?,"I am 30(F).

I do confess I was overweight for 5-7 kilograms and my face quite chubby. But activities and housework like cleaning the whole house every day, keeping our garden tidy, ( our garden is like a small farm we have everything in it) bringing drinking water from far with 10 L bucket several times a week which is normal in our region and it was daily routine kept me in a form. But because of my chubby face, I started being bullied at school. Then even my sister and my mother started to remind me to not eat much bread or food to be in shape. While most of the man’s work at the house were on me. Saying Men’s work I mean really heavy work like prepare firewood for the winter, drag newly bought 2 tons of coal to the warehouse so it will be dry thee until winter and etc. Of course, I needed the energy I ate to get it. One day after one US reality show was  aired on Russian MTV, about an obese woman who was around 400lb. She wasn’t able to move and was going to get the surgery she had elephant skin as well,  my sister 15y.o. called me an elephant, with my weight 48-50 kg when I was 13y.o.  offended. I was a short person and was chubby. But what could I said to her just called her stupid? Family is a Family.  Another day my mother called me heavy as a swamp stone, it is an expression in my language that means huge.  I get offended I told my mom how it wasn't right and why she called me that. she said she called me with love. I was bullied through the school everyday, children are meanest ones, and I don't talk about some teachers who were saying other things about my appearance . Like it wasn't enough my family reminding me things about proper meal. I was eating Same food as them, but sometimes they asked to finish extra plate so it wouldn't  get wasted. Same story about University. I moved to UAE for work. When I am going on vacation to my country mother wants me to get married and says how beautiful I am and need to find some man to get married and I asked her how someone will marry “Swamp stone” girl? How any man in my country where I have never heard any compliment, where every stranger was able to bully me, finds me attractive?

Currently, I am 30 y.o. 68 Kg short quite happy who I am, what I have achieved, having a breakdown because my eldest sister sent me a pic of mine 19 y.o. slim and pretty and remembering how was bullied even if I was normal. I am always reminding my other sister and mother how they used to call me. They say they never said such things or even if they said I need to overcome it. but how? I can't forget anything from the past. Especially from my own family. Crying every time I remember all these things. AITA for reminding them of all the bad words they used to call me?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not getting married?,"Weird title, so hear me out. Throwaway for privacy. Also English is not my first language.

Me (F25) and my BF (M30) have been together for 8 years. We love each other very much and are very happy together. We have three cats, a nice house, and good jobs. While the idea of getting married has occurred to us, neither of us feel in a rush to do so, mostly because we are very protective over our own finances and worry about what would happen in the event of divorce, even though we of course don't intend to divorce, it is still something we are weary of. We decided we want to wait until we are both more comfortable with it.

Cut to the point, we just found out my mom has stage 4 breast cancer and is not expected to live more than another year. She is my absolute best friend in this world and I am devastated. Here's the thing, her only wish was to see me get married and have the wedding that she and I talked about many times before. 

It's the only thing she wants. However, for reasons I mentioned, I am not yet comfortable taking this step. Should I just do it so that my mom can have her dying wish? AITA if I don't?",Not the A-hole
aita for saying that my uncle should just leave our family alone?,"My dad (37m) has always been kind of a push over and my uncle (47m) over time, has taken advantage of that. I don’t know if I even consider him as my uncle now. (For a little more context my dad and my uncle are half brothers.)

My uncle had been living in México up to this point. Then all of sudden he had decided to come to the US so he got his green card and took a plane to where my family lives. My other uncle (39m) (whom I will refer to him as uncle R so there won’t be any confusion) had said that my uncle could live with him and his family. 
But not too long after he moved it all went downhill. 

My uncle had met woman that he was serious about the “only” problem being that she lived 20 hrs away so he would often go and visit her. My uncle works for my dads small construction company (he only has a few workers) so when my uncle went to visit his gf and decided to move there my dad was pissed. He was left with so much extra work. Long story short it didn’t work out and he came back then after a while got back with her moved again and repeated this about 4 more times and each time my dad let my uncle work with him and gave him
Money for food and other stuff. Even after all that my uncle talked so much sh*t about my dad and my uncle R so they decided that they were done with all his crap and cut all ties with him. 

Now my uncle is back. He has been living in his car trying to make himself the victim and gain back my dad and uncle R’s trust. My uncle R is pretty stubborn so he didn’t fall for any of his crap but like I mentioned before my dad is the opposite. my dad has now rented him an apartment and loaned him some money. When I saw my uncle again he acted like he hadn’t done anything wrong which really pissed me off so I said “you should just leave us alone.” In the heat of the moment. I do kind of feel bad because deep down I still love him but he really isn’t deserving of my dads forgiveness and it hurts me that he said all these bad things about my dad and he is just going to let my uncle screw him over again.

WIBTA If I Kick My Mother In Law Out Of My Wedding?,"My (23M) fiancee(24F) and I have been together for a few years now and I are starting to finalize details for our wedding. My MIL and I have rarely seen eye to eye, as she doesn't like the fact that I'm nonreligious and not straight.

One of the issues we butt heads on is gender and pronouns. She actively refuses to respect the pronouns of any person who uses they/them or any form of nonbinary pronouns. This is likely to be a big issue at our wedding since one of the members of my fiancee's bridal party, Z, is nonbinary, and has been using they/them pronouns for a few years. MIL actively goes out of her way to misgender and disrespect them.

I spoke with my fiancee about this and we've decided that the only way to go would be to let everyone know that if they don't respect people's preferred pronouns at the party, they will be asked to leave. I don't want any guests at my wedding to be offended or upset and I certainly don't want any arguments started.

To me, it seems inevitable that I will have to ask my MIL to leave, and I know that they family will talk about it and likely be upset, as many of them share her opinions, and I'm worried that kicking her out of her only daughter's wedding will make be the bad guy.

AITA for letting my 4 year old sister think I have magic,"My (16f) 4 year old sister came to the conclusion that I have magic a few weeks ago because I can fix toys, make balloon animals, do face paint, and bake. My parents and I think it's adorable and we just go with it.

She decided to tell her entire class that I have magic and one of the little boys in the class got jealous that he doesn't have any magic siblings and started crying. We didn't think much of it until my aunt called my parents and yelled at them for lying to my sister (apparently she's good friends with the kid's mom and found out what happened through them). She told my parents that this lie is harmful to both my sister and the other kids in the class and I'm starting to feel bad so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.",Not the A-hole
AITA for calling my Dad sexist and a jerk?,"I am (15F), and I live with my Dad and my three sibling, Sam (13M), (10F) and (8M).

Sam has Adolescent Scoliosis, and the Doctors, Sam and Dad agreed that some other steps to try and help him should be taken before surgery. Sam's back pain tends to 'flare up' and sometimes he can move and walk around like a normal kid, and he picks up after himself, but then his pain flares up and he's basically glued to his bed or the couch. 

Our Dad works a lot and I'm the oldest so if Sam's pain gets really bad and Dad isn't at home then I'm basically the person who has to clean up after him and get him painkillers or something to eat, and I think it's really unfair. Dad does it when he's home most of the time, but he makes me do it if he's grading papers or something instead of going to do it himself like anybody else would, and I feel like I was chosen to help Sam just because I'm the oldest girl and because Dad feels I can take care of him better. 

I confronted Dad about it and he apologized that I felt this way but that they (him and Sam) needed help right now and that he felt I was being a little dramatic about it. That really ticked me off, he wasn't taking my feelings to heart at all and he was basically making me a slave to my brother. I told him he was acting like a jerk about it and that he was bein sexist by making me take care of my brother, even though he's able to care for himself. 

That got Dad upset and he told me that I was taking things 'too far' and that he made a big show about telling me he 'understood' my frustration but that I needed to calm down and understand that Sam needed help and that he couldn't look after Sam by himself all day because he has work and ogher obligations. 

I was really mad about it and I walked away from the conversation but even though I'm still mad, I'm wondering if maybe I did go a little too far because my Dad usually doesn't argue with me like this. I don't think I'm wrong for putting my foot down, but am I wrong for calling my Dad what I did?",Asshole
"AITA for not inviting my cousin to a party, even though I owe her a favor?","She’s actually my second cousin or something, but I’m simplifying here. 

I (22F) was kicked out by my egg donor last February. I was having issues with my mental health and was failing a class, which made her decide to throw me out. My cousin Clare (25F) took me in, and she’s been so great. We were never close, but she was there for me when I was in a bad place. 

Well, I have a job and a rental now, and my roommate and I had planned to throw a party over Fourth of July. Our past parties have gotten rowdy, ie people having foursomes, molly, and someone breaking their arm on our porch swing. 

My cousin Clare is Christian, and I didn’t think she’d appreciate the vibe, so I didn’t think to invite her. She heard that I was having a party from my brother, and she kinda tried to invite herself. I said “hell no” because of the reasons I mentioned, and she texted that I was distancing myself now that I wasn’t using her for housing anymore. I don’t think excluding someone from a party they wouldn’t enjoy is “using” them.

AITA for calling a kids behaviour annoying? (posting on behalf of a friend),"AMITA for calling a kids behaviour annoying? (posting for a friend)

Hi - first time posting here, but long time reader. I’m asking this on behalf of a friend, and just because I’m curious about what other people would think about the situation, as it happened a couple weeks ago and I’m still wondering about it. 

Situation was that myself (25F) and a friend/ex of sorts (30ishM) went to the beach to hangout for the evening. I hadn’t seen him in quite a while and we were sitting far away from the water, on a log near the pathway. We were in the midst of a quite serious discussion and this mom with her two kids came over and set up right next to us, no more than 1m away. Kind of weird because there was plenty of other space nearby and they were being super loud but it looked like they were just packing up to leave, so whatever. 

One of the kids (approx 10M) came and stood about a meter away from us (in front of us) with a giant stick and just started screaming (no words, just loudly screaming) in our faces, staring at us. My friend (30M) gave him a “discouraging” look and the kid left. But then he came back, a minute or two later, and continued doing this. My friend said to the kid “can you stop doing that, as it’s quite annoying” and the kid left. Then the mom came over and started yelling at my friend (30M), saying “how dare you call my kid annoying” etc etc. and my friend said “I didn’t call your kid annoying, I said what he’s doing is annoying” (background info: he does have a degree in education and experience teaching) and she went off on him. I can’t remember exactly what she said, but to paraphrase it was along the lines of “you’re a f****** loser, you’re an asshole, you’re pathetic” and turns to me and says “you’re so unlucky to be with this loser, never have kids with him because he’ll be an asshole to them too” etc etc. This goes on for about five minutes as she’s screaming at him in front of her kids, but at this point he’s just calmly being as non reactive as possible. 

So, WHBTA for calling this kids behaviour annoying?",Not the A-hole
AITA for charging to take photos of the Bride?,"I’m a photographer. One of my family members had sent me a couple that was looking for a wedding photographer. From the get go, this couple was being very “frugal” with their money. Since I had sympathy, I cut my prices to help lower that burden.

From the get go, they tried cutting every corner to get the most out of me. They wanted to dress their kids up and bring them to their engagement shoot so they could also sneak some family photos (not cool, didn’t allow it). They booked me for 3 hours of their wedding and I knew this was going to pose a problem, but 3 was all they could afford and apparently all they needed.

Leading up to the wedding, I knew that we didn’t have any time to spare when it came to the photos. I asked the bride for the itinerary for the wedding and also ALL must-have photos with an example for her to use. The DAY BEFORE the wedding, she says there isn’t a schedule and we will “wing it”, and the shot list definitely showed that someone did it last minute. 

Wedding day comes and everything is an unorganized disaster. There were very few moments where the bride and groom could actually be taken away (wedding was at 5 on a Friday, I was booked from 5-8). While I’m capturing all the important shots on the list, I’m trying to grab solo photos of the bride and groom, but they don’t make time for me. Something was always coming up to where when we were ready to go outside, they would tell me to wait. I even push my time to 8:30 because I knew there would be some regret later, so I tell them I’m leaving and I just need a photo of them two. The groom comes out YELLING because I’ve taken him away from the party to take “stupid pictures” and honestly, the behavior was grotesque. I took the picture and left.

A week passes and I get a text from the bride at 11pm. “Omg, I was just having so much fun that I just realized we didn’t take any solo shots of myself”. And she didn’t. Because she wouldn’t make time to take them. Because she wouldn’t give me a schedule that we could actually work with. Sooooo now, the bride is requesting that I do a “greatly-discounted or free” bridal shoot for her, since I didn’t get any solo shots from the wedding. AITA for charging her for these photos?

TL;DR the bride would not make time at her wedding for me to take solo shots of her, is now requesting a bridal shoot for a big discount or free. AITA for charging for the shoot?",Not the A-hole
AITA for actually terminating the rental agreement?,"I (29M) have been trying to work with my flatmate (32M) on signing a new lease as the last one has expired. I wasn't made aware of this until June so that's when I discussed ensuring his credit and background wouldn't lead us to be denied. Unfortunately his life is emotionally taxing so asking him to do anything was difficult. I was always anxious about it being the thing that sent him to his tipping point. We've been outstanding and awesome friends since day one. 

I've also been dealing with some financial incompetence so keeping this place has been incredibly taxing on me. But the convince of staying outweighs moving during these times. 

So a few days back I had mentioned I'd be gone at my partners for the night but decided to head home to get some solid sleep. Got home(23:55), opened some windows to cool the place down and not five minutes later I hear windows slamming and walls being hit. I come out of the restroom to confront him and he just starts yelling at the top of his lungs. He was piss drunk and upset that I came home when I said I'd be gone for the night. Then insued tons of inappropriate personal jabs. His final words are ""two months. I'm out in two fucking months"".

I confronted him the next day saying that time line doesn't work for me or management. We either call October the final month or he has 30 days. He chose 30 days. I requested 25% of rent for August and his portion in utilities and gave him a date to be out so I can clean, get my deposit back and go be homeless on my September vacation I've planned all year. 

He's since expressed he doesn't really want to leave all while making incredibly personal insults. Further ensuring this is too hostile of a living situation that I'm overpaying for.

I interrupted him to talk about what I'll be getting in return, to which person B said it's too early to say anything.

I have this recurrent argument with my dad, im 17 and I'm waiting until i have 18 so i can move out my country (Venezuela, we are in a really bad economical situation).
My dad is stubborn, never really gives me love but i can understand he cares about me, never really has been supportive towards me and im tired of that, he doesn't let me go to get the psychological help i need, doesn't let me go see my friends in the pandemic (im not a party person, just want to go to the house of one of them to play some videogames or whatever) and is always angry at me for no reason, every time I do something bad he looks so disappointed at me doesn't matter how little it is and every time I do something good he doesn't tell me anything; good grades, drawings, overcoming my fears, helping in the store. Not a single word.

I got tired, I want to move out for that and because the country i live in is literally falling to pieces. I expressed this to him; not like this of course. I tried to told him that even if i didn't start college (University here is really bad) i could get a job because i know someone who can help me, i tried to tell him why moving out and getting college in another country would be 100% better. I have a safe way to get a home, a job, a new life, something that really motivates me. 
Is my dream, and i told him that; i would be a native in there, i would have a job that I would be prepared for first, a house, my boyfriend and his mom that after all this years I consider my own mom too. 

He just yelled at me, he said me no and its telling to my only support right now, my grandmother, that if she helps me and something bad happens to me would be her fault.

I'm not going to listen to him and if I'll do everything that I can to make my dream happen. And he already knows that, but now he isn't even talking to me and looks at me so bad every single day that is destroying me. and I want to know.

She stayed in our hotel room where a 6 month old baby was sleeping. Smoking pills and shooting up in the bathroom every night.

AITA Deep Freeze of 2020,"Hey guys, I need your opinions.. Am l The Asshole?

To start, I (26f) use to live in the same town as a guy I went to high school with (John), he has 3 kids and a wife (Jamie). Now I was not close with Jamie but our kids had play dates together, we would speak at the grocery store and I followed her on FB. So I suppose we could be considered acquaintances. Anyway..

John got in a bad Bike accident, which broke his back. Thankfully he was going to recover, though it was going to be a long process. Someone set up a go fund me page because now that John was not able to work, Jamie was a stay at home mom and they needed to have a source of income. I don't like GoFundMe due to the fact that they take a percentage of the proceeds. So I directly messaged Jamie and spoke with her about how I could help out her family. That's when she informed me that they needed another freezer as their other one was getting full. So, I found a chest freezer on Kijiji, nice, in good condition but not brand new, because I couldn't afford a brand new one. It fit the length of my truck box, so like 6 feet maybe? I sent her pictures of it and asked if that would help them out. She said yes, I went, picked it up and my dad had it at his garage until John's parents could pick it up and drop it off because J&J's truck wasn't working.

So, fast forward 6 months and I private message Jamie on FB and asked her how the freezer was working for them. She said ""oh well it took a long time to get here because our truck was not running and my FIL never got around to bringing it to us. But so far it's working great"" I replied with ""That's great! I am so glad it's working for you!"" And she follows up with ""I mean TBH it's actually too small for what my family NEEDS and I might sell it and use that money to buy a bigger/ better one, like one of those stand up ones""

I was shocked, part of me understands but also part of me felt hurt and disrespected. She said that freezer would work, I sent pictures and everything! But whatever.. so I replied ""We gave you that freezer to help your family, I think morally it would be wrong and just plain rude for you to sell something given to you just because it's not exactly what you wanted"" (even though she said it was perfect)

She told me that it's her freezer and she can do whatever she wants with it (which is very true). She hasn't spoken to me since and my Brother said I'm being an asshole about nothing, I shouldn't have said anything to her to guilt her into keeping it. I think she's being a bit of a brat TBH.

AITA (16F) for not wanting to spend the night at my friends (16F) house because I'm on my period?,"The title basically says it all. Some background: last week, my friend told me she wanted me to spend the night at her house since we hadn't met each other in a long time. I told her I would ask my mother (since she's kinda strict about this stuff) for permission. My mother said no, but said I could go the next week. 

So this week, I confirmed that I would come to her house on Friday. Well, this morning (Thursday for me) I got my period. My periods are fairly severe. I get really bad cramps and headaches, which I definitely need to take medicine for. Even without that, spending the night in an unfamiliar place (I've only visited her 3/4 times previously) while I'm experiencing the general discomfort makes me feel icky.

So, I told her that I was on my period and it would be better if we reschedule. She told me that the only other available time for her is the end of August, which is pretty late. I told her I'm sorry but I really didn't want to come over on this weekend. She said it wasn't a big deal and I should just come on Friday. I insisted I wouldn't feel well, and she stood her stance in trying to convince me to come. She, then, I think, got mad, and told me I shouldn't be selfish. I told her her I would come on Saturday if I felt up to it. (Although I doubt that I will.) We ended our conversation then.

AITA for telling my dad “not to talk to my mother that way”?,"I (21f) have been in the middle of my parents’ divorce for nearly half a decade. They had always told me how crappy the other person is that they won’t give them something they want. They were very hostile to each other and went through court so for long to decide what’s what. I never, ever took sides (though I did have a “favorite parent”, just as parents most likely have a “favorite child”), until this point.

My mom had been paying my dad $800+ a month for child support for my underage brother for the past two years. My dad did not use most of this money for my brother, who it was meant for, and instead used most of it on things he wanted like a motorcycle and gifts for his current girlfriend. After my brother turned 18 (which was in March), the payments stopped because he was now an adult.

My dad has recently asked my mom if she could cough up $300 a month for our health insurance, since my brother and I are still on his plan. My mother supports us unconditionally and helps us with the monetary things we need. She makes my life very fulfilled in more ways than one, and she has gone out of her way to help her kids, such as helping me move out of a terrible living situation that my ex and I had gotten into with an older roommate. She dropped everything and helped us move out on a days notice.

My mom told me how their conversation went, and my dad basically said he did as much for us as she does, which is clearly not true when I take everything into account (I didn’t even get a happy birthday on my 21st from him, which is fine but like, I’m your daughter?). He told my mom to get over herself. I texted my dad that he shouldn’t talk to my mother that way, and that if he needs money so badly, he should ask my brother for rent since he has the means to pay it and is willing (brother still lives with my dad).

AITA for needing a day where I can be by myself and take a break from my grandma.,"I (17m) recently got a job at a Sonic Drive In. I was originally intended to be a part time employee but we are extremely short handed. So I have become a full time employee. I normally have two days off a week, and my grandma (73f) insists I spend the entire day with her. 

The only problem is, she constantly tells me how useless I am, she tells me I am a waste of space and so on. She constantly makes me feel bad because her food budget was shot for this month. Since I have a job I have offered her money to help out with her food budget. She claimed I had attacked her and she refused the help. So I figured she just didn't want to feel like she was relying on anyone to help her out, so I took initiative and got us groceries for a couple of weeks. She was furious and went off on me. I also order food from a restaraunt once a week, I ask her what she wants and she never answers, so I end up getting what I know she likes. Then she refuses to eat it. 

Last night I had accidentally woken her up when I came in because I couldn't get the dogs to stop barking fast enough. This morning she told me how her being woken up last night had physically, mentally, and emotionally damaged her. I felt so bad that I was nauseous for hours. Before I went to work I had wanted to get something for lunch so I ordered food. I asked if she wanted anything and she said no. So I ended up getting her something I knew she liked. 

When the food got here she went off on me again telling me that I was a waste of space and making me feel bad once again. She is beginning to wear me down mentally. I genuinely just want at least one day where I do what I want and not have to feel like crap. My entire day at work I had began to fell like IWTA. My friends are saying that I'm NTA, but I can't help feeling that I am.",Not the A-hole
AITA for using a former tenant's security deposit to properly dispose of electronics they left without running the price by them?,"Had a tenant (T) move out at the end of last month. A couple of weeks prior to their move out date, I informed them that they needed to make sure all the belongings they needed were taken. Anything left would be disposed of either via normal trash pick-up or special disposal services for anything that needed it.

T left an old tv, a couple of monitors, an old desktop computer, printer, digital clock and a couple of other electronics in their room. I messaged them asking them if they were planning on picking these up. If they weren't, I would need to get a special disposal service as normal trash pick up will not take these electronics. This was after they had moved out and returned their keys so would need to know when to let them in if they wanted these items. T responded saying they would not be able to pick the items and to charge them for the removal service.

Got the items removed through a disposal service and it was fairly expensive due to it being electronics and type of electronics. I returned T's security deposit which had the disposal service cost deducted. I provided a security deposit letter with a breakdown of the deductions along with all necessary back-up. Once T received the net security deposit back, he messaged me saying he could not believe how expensive the disposal was. That I should have asked him before going ahead with it and tried to find a more affordable option.

I told T that I had already spent my time scheduling the pick-up and spent my money fronting the cost of the proper disposal of the electronics. I had already asked him to pick up his items and told him there would be removal service involved if not. I did not need to run the cost by him. If he wanted to find affordable options, he should have done that himself. He can also look up electronic disposal services and see for himself how prices compare at other places if he does not believe me. It is not on me to spend my time shopping around for affordable options to get rid of items he left behind.

T sent back a fairly angry text saying it was BS that I did not run the price by him as otherwise he would have figured out a way to come back to take the electronics.

AITA for having my uncle buy me a car,"So my uncle and I are super close like a father-daughter relationship. My mom takes money from him all the time and I’m always the one to force her to pay him back.

AITA for ruining my cousin's Minecraft build,"The title may sound bad but please read the story. My cousin and I have a survival world on Minecraft. It's not a server so I can't just join the world whenever, I have to wait till he's on. I'm 14 and he's 11. We've been on this specific world for about 2-3 months and I've made a lot of progress.

I built a large house with a balcony and porch. I'm very much a architectural player so I put a lot of effort into the area. The house had a lake that was huge. I spent hours building trees planting flowers and building a dock. I loved it. 

Well I was away with a friend and my cousin texted me yesterday and told me he was going to build near my lake and asked if that was okay. I said sure as long as he didn't fill in any of the lake and destroy any of the plants. I logged on yesterday and when I walked outside my house I didn't even recognize it. The lake and all the plants were gone. And in its place was a path that was half a block in the ground. I was on the livid and on the verge of tears because and asked the cousin what the hell happened. He said that he wanted a path between our houses because crossing the lake was too hard so he filled it in. I was crying at this point because he then told me he turned all the plants into dye to trade with villagers and color his bed. He used the wood from the trees as furnace fuel. I spent hours collecting all that stuff and some of the plants were rare and hard to find. I hung up on him and left the world. I just cried. He was mad at me for leaving because ""it's just some stupid lake and plants the path is much better"". 

Well here's where I might be the asshole. Today we were on and he said that he was going on a trip to Walmart and would be gone for a while and was leaving his laptop on so I could remain on the world. I broke his path and redid the lake. I went and collected a few saplings and took his tools and stuff to help. I burned the planks from the path in a lava pit and made sure to break every tool of his I used. When he came back he exploded at me for messing up his build.

""What the hell I spent time on the path why did you break it""

""I told you not to fill in my lake and destroy my plants so I just rebuilt MY stuff that you broke first""

""You're delusional, there wasn't a lake there""

""I have screenshots""

He kicked me from the world and said that I was a asshole and that I had no right to destroy the build he spent so much time on. I thought I was justified but he got his mom involved and she texted my mom claiming he said I was breaking his stuff and was bullying him so now his mom is mad at me. My mom doesn't care.

AITA for not wanting to move in with my fiancé's best friend?,"Ok this is my first, and probably my last, post. So here we go.
I'm a 19 year old trans ftm living with my fiancé (20) and his grandparents. I always manage to forget stuff (example just now, I forgot to put the milk away last night -I was tired- and his grandfather found it and got upset at me.)
I want to move out, mostly so I don't destroy the house with my stupidity. 
My fiancé, let's call him K, wants to move out too, but not to our own place. He wants to move in with his best friend, C. C and I kind of get along, but not to the point that I'd want to live with him. He's messy (I've actually had to clean his kitchen many times) and he's got a new puppy that likes to chew my feet. His house is always hot, and I pass out easily. And all my fiancé does when we both go over there is play Apex while I just sit there on my phone fending off the dog. 
I've also got 2 guinea pigs and don't want them to get eaten by the dog, die by the heat, etc.
My fiance also wants to use OUR money that we've been saving (for the purpose of getting a place of our own) to make renovations on C's house so we can move in.
I do not want to move in there, and I've talked with him many times about it before, but he always comes back with ""He needs us there, he's having a hard time paying for rent, food, etc. Plus, it's the cheapest option, cuz all other places would have other places would have other costs as well"" or something like that and it makes me feel like I'm a selfish prick. 
I can't stand being guilt tripped, so I usually just cave in and say fine so as to end the conversation.
I have always wanted a place of my own, but I don't want to upset my fiancé.

AITA for not wanting to delete all photos from a photoshoot?,"I'm a hobby photographer. by no means professional, i just do shoots with friends here and there or people in my local area that reach out to me and usually for no cost unless it costs me something to do it such as studio rental and stuff like that

Anyway, i have a long time friend ill call Pink, about 3 weeks ago Pink had a major breakup with her boyfriend, i did the friendly thing and comforted her where i could, all that, then about a week ago she texts me and says that she's tired of feeling sorry for herself and wants to do something to build her self confidence back up and asks me if I would be up for renting a studio and doing a boudoir shoot, something ive only done a few times before, (boudoir is a shoot in lingerie or tasteful nude) i said sure, found a studio for rent nearby, cleared it with her, we agreed that i would take a handful of the pictures to put on my website for a portfolio, maybe put a few on instagram, stuff like that but she had final say in which i posted where, and we rented it, took a boatload of photos, some in lingerie, some nude, had a great time. she was happy with how they looked even before editing, she venmo'd me half the studio cost, signed the photo release and i went home and popped them into a hard drive to start editing the next day.

There were a lot of photos so i couldn't do them all in one day so i would just pick away at them when i had time in the day, then yesterday Pink calls me and asks me to delete all the pictures. i was taken aback and asked why and she just said she wasn't comfortable with it anymore and i need to delete all of them now. the problem is that the studio was $50 an hour. we rented it for 6 hours. i didnt mind swallowing $150 to help a friend and get a little self promotion out of it while having fun. but i do mind just straight up losing $150 and getting nothing in return. i told pink this and said that i would rather just have her give me the other $150 and send her all the photos to do whatever she wanted with, but she accused me of blackmail and threatened to tell all out mutual friends and social media that im a horrible monster thats holding her nudes ransom for money.

I haven't posted them anywhere yet. they're all still in the editing software. and i feel awful right now that this is happening. i don't want to be an asshole so i would really appreciate a judgement and maybe some advice if that is okay to ask for here. I'm really just lost in what to do here

EDIT: this keeps coming up in the comments. im absolutely not posting them anywhere. thats the last thing on my mind. just to be clear

UPDATE: i decided to take u/SaveFerrisBrother advice. copied all the images in their current state onto a thumb drive, delete all the images off of the SD Cards, hard drive and editing software and i called pink and asked her to meet me for coffee tomorrow, my treat, to hash this whole thing out. i told her about the thumb drive and how everything on my end other than that was gone and the first thing i was doing when i saw her was handing her the thumb drive to do whatever she wanted with and money is off the table right now. i just want to keep being her friend and settle this amicably and in person. and i apologized for giving her the impression that i was blackmailing her and it wasn't my intention at all. she was calm and apologized in return for threatening to badmouth me to our friends and agreed to meet tomorrow. ill update this post again tomorrow or make another one with how it goes. thank you all for the advice and judgements",Not the A-hole
AITA For Not Helping My Mom?,"I’m 21 years old and am living at home with my mom while I finish up school. My father and mother are divorced. However, he is lives elsewhere and pays our house payment (will continue until I graduate college). I work part-time and make relatively good money most of which I put in my savings because I help my father pay my college tuition 50/50. Although, I do help with bills (i.e water, internet, and softener rental) because I understand that I should help out with that and I can. 

My mother is a hairstylist and has been since the late 80s. She has had some medical issues from the constant standing on her feet and holding up hair dryers and bending over to wash/dry hair. I do what I can to help and I don’t mind helping out with/picking up the salon in the basement. 

The one thing that bothers me is that she has come to expect my help. She calls me while I’m not at home to wash her towels/capes for the salon. And to sweep up the hair that she has left on the floor. Not to mention, the array of colored pieces of foil that she leaves in the sink (when there is a garbage I labeled beside the sink).

After cleaning up the sink, taking the garbage out of the salon, and washing her towels (yesterday) she asked if I could spend another 30 minutes to help her clean the rest of the salon today. I told her no because it irritates me that she depends on me to clean something that I don’t even use. I don’t mind if it’s once in a little while, but I don’t want to be taken advantage of.

She was mad and then started bringing up stuff from the past about my sister, money and working. And how I didn’t give her money earlier this week.

(My mom does not have the greatest concept of saving money. When she gets paid from clients she has the tendency to spend it quickly and then goes to my father and asks him for money)

This past Monday, my older sister gave birth  and my mom asked me for spending money. After not receiving my paycheck (another long story) and getting ready to pay an expensive bill, I said I don’t have any money available. She asked if I could take money out of my savings and I told her no and that it is for my tuition.

She then yelled at me and hung up.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not apologizing to my uncle´s wife?,"For as long as I can remember, I´ve (22F) always had a very close relationship with my uncle (mother´s side; 45M) and he´s like a second father to me. He lived in our house with my parents and my sister for almost 12 years until he decided to move to his own place. That's when he started dating A (40F).

Since he introduced us, we all hated A. She´s a manipulative, rude woman and looked down on us from the beginning, even though she still lived with her parents and had a 10 year old son, E. Besides, it was very evident that she´s a gold digger and was dating my uncle because he had his own house and was the owner of a successful mechanic shop.

Two years later, my uncle decided to break up with A, which made us all happy, but then, he announces that they´re getting married because A is pregnant. When he was 19, my uncle suffered a motorcycle accident that left him sterile, something that affected him a lot because he always wanted children. That´s why it seemed strange and convenient to all of us that A got pregnant just when my uncle wanted to break up with her, even though it was impossible for him.

Years passed, they had twins and we grew apart, something that hurt me a lot because we used to be very close. While in high school, we had to write an essay about a family event that affected us and I wrote about A. About her being a bad woman who took advantage of my uncle and that the twins were surely not his. I put the essay in my backpack and that afternoon my uncle visited us with E, who at some point opened my backpack and stole the essay.

I must clarify that E have always been jealous of me for the relationship I have with my uncle and always tried to beat me in everything, but never succeeded and that filled him with rage, especially since my uncle always took my side and didn´t think of him as a son.

A came to the house and demanded that I apologize, that everything I wrote was a lie and that the twins were identical to my uncle, which was an obvious lie. My uncle is 6'3 ""tall, has slightly dark skin and brown hair. The twins are practically dwarfs, they´re whiter than paper and have light red hair. I didn't apologize and my mom supported me, calling her a shameless gold digger. A left, warning us that she was my uncle's ""owner"" and that we would never see him again.

Since then, our uncle hasn´t visited us, but still calls my mom with a phone that he bought behind his wife's back. He doesn´t blame me and continues to treat me with love, but I know it´s because deep down he feels that what I wrote is true and he´s thinking about it. Everyone in the family thinks I'm a hero for telling off A, but not seeing her baby brother anymore makes my mom sad.

I know that everything would go back to the way it was if I swallowed my pride and apologized to A, but if I do my uncle will never leave her. So, AITA for not apologizing to my uncle´s wife?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not lending my brother money and going to our dad behind his back?,"So, my (f24) little brother is 21 and he’s rented accommodation to spend time in at his university city. He’s there to celebrate graduating and to spend some time with his two best friends, but he’s doing this and living on borrowed money as he’s unemployed.

My brother ‘Oscar’ has a big problem with money management. He’s always buying things, big brands, expensive clothes, etc. then complains that he’s broke and that dad needs to step in and help. I think this is to help with his self-esteem issues, honestly, because he’s always on Instagram and wants to emulate these flashy lifestyle influencers he follows, and dad took pity on him for a while. Dad, however, recently decided that he’s not helping anymore if he’s overspending and has become very strict with Oscar out of nowhere, which has taken him by surprise.

My brother calls me up to explain that he’s run out of money and needs more cash to go out and do all the activities he’s planned with his friends, that he doesn’t know where the money went so quickly. I ask him, why are you calling me? This is normally a conversation he’d have with dad, but he explains that he can’t risk getting in trouble, that dad will just say no, and that he needs money for food, too. I’m getting suspicious, because he asks for around 150/200, which definitely surpasses a few groceries. I say to call dad for this, but this causes him to get upset. He says that he “literally can’t eat” and I tell him that I doubt this. We argue a bit, and he bites back saying that he hopes I never have kids, if this is how I’m going to act with them. And this is a personal dig, because my big dream is, and always has been, to work with social care and to adopt children. I hang up, and I go on to inform dad that he’s broke, which causes a big fight to break out. Dad is furious with Oscar for his behaviour and is demanding that he comes home early if he’s out of money already.

I’m starting to feel bad now, because I didn’t have to go behind his back and maybe I should’ve just helped him out; I didn’t mean to cut off his trip early and now he’s in serious trouble with dad. Maybe I acted rashly and unfairly, and I’m being selfish with my money, but at the same time surely he needs to learn how to be responsible? AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for ruining my sister’s visit with our parents?,"My family and I all live in Texas, and recently my parents retired and bought a cabin in Wisconsin. My parents are staying in Wisconsin all summer and fall. My sister went to visit for few weeks with her kids. 


She asked me to watch her very old and fragile dogs for a few days while her husband is on a work trip. The dogs have health issues and can barely move. I've noticed that even after taking them out to do their business, they constantly pee in the home. I also have a pet dog and understand it happens, but it seems to be more frequent. I text my sister, “what's wrong with your dogs? They are constantly peeing in the house even shortly after being let out?”. I quickly got a flurry of calls and texts from my mother stating I am ruining the trip. Your sister wants to go home, and I'm selfish. 

They even text me how my sister plans on leaving the next day to fly out and pick up the dogs because I am incapable of watching them. I wasn't upset about peeing in the house since I've grown up with pets, but the fact it's occurring very frequently even after letting them out. I was alarmed that something is wrong and didn't want to blame if something were to happen to the dogs while my sister is away. I wasn't trying to make my sister feel bad. It was just a concern for her dogs. Am I the asshole for texting my sister that their dogs are frequently peeing in my house while she's visiting our parents?

AITA for making my sister feel bad for not helping taking care of my mom?,"My (35m)  sister (33s) moved out of her place (now my place) to go live with her now gf (this came as a shock to my mom and my mom is older and doesn't agree but that's another story). My mother had been really sick and been going through surgeries. I've been able to take care of her for well over a year since I had savings and was getting unemployment. Now that all that is over I need help. My mom has poor eyesight so she can't administer her medications probably and has trouble moving around so she can't really cook for herself and she doesn't drive or speak English well so she can't go to her appointments on her own. My sister on the other hand doesn't work and is basically a stay at home mom.  She always tells my mom ""I'll go help take care of you just let me get some things straight over here"". Well she makes an excuse every time she's supposed to come help. It is a far drive 2.5 hours away. It's never really bothered me since I havent needed help but now that I'm forced to work I really needed her help and she's still not coming. 

My mom surprisingly opened up to me about the fact that she doesn't think she's coming to take care of her ever because she's infatuated with her new relationship and she over heard her on the phone saying that her partner doesn't really want her coming and staying days or weeks here. My mom said that when she's needed her mom her daughter abandoned her. Now my mom might be also saying all this since she doesn't approve of her relationship but again that's another story. 

Well this week after I paid rent I barely had any money to buy food or do anything. I gave great friends that lent me a hand but what I needed was to work so I asked my sister to come help take care of my mom. She even called my mom and said I'll be there this week to take care of you. Anyways the day she was supposed to come take care of my mom she calls me and tells me she has car trouble and can't make it. Doesn't know when she can. I told my mom and she was devastated. I couldnt help it and I told my sister everything my mom has said about feeling abandoned and needed her and my sister started crying saying it's not like that.

AITA for telling my friend no matter her intentions she sounds like a creep?,"I(24f) was at a skatepark with my friend (25f). I don't know if this is going to make sense but this skatepark is in a city that's a suburb and can be considered a suburb for 2 very well-known cities and 1 decently well-known city due to sports and one of them is a tourist attraction. Yet me and my friend live in a suburb of this suburb. So we were at this skatepark and there were this group of kids who all had JR.High school end-of-year sweaters on (it was their last day of school) so we can presume they're between 11-13. (2ms,3fs).

They were having a fun time and were laughing but one of the kids lost his balance near the bowl then fell in. He tumbled and he was severely cut and his helmet flew of his head a bit so he hit his head pretty hard. My friend and I immediately went over there we helped the kid out and when my friend saw the size of the cuts she was concerned. She said we need to get you to the ER, Ill even pay for what happens (knowing her she would). He said he's fine. Then my friend said no your not those cuts are way to big. She asked if he could have a parent or guardian or someone's number. He said most are at work. She said that he needed help and that we needed to get him to the (hospital) in (our city) its a short drive away, all of you can fit. Signaling to her SUV. They all apologized for the hassle and speed-walked away. I then told my friend that she probably freaked the fuck out of them. She asked what I meant. I told her that she was being very pushy with them and especially trying to get them to another city. I told her that she did have a good idea but should be a lot less pushy and especially not when we're trying to take them to another city and that even to me she sounded like a creep.

AITA for telling my SIL I agreed with her over my wife?,"Throwaway because I don't want this on my main. My (30m) wife (28f) and her older brother’s wife (35f) had a falling out a few years ago. I don’t want to get into details about their falling out but basically my wife and her SIL used to be super close, and my wife had confided in her with some personal info that her SIL told others when she agreed not to. This happened in 2017 and has dramatically affected their friendship.

They’re still always going to be cordial, they even still laugh together but my wife doesn’t trust her and doesn’t want to be close to her anymore. They’ve been distant since it happened in 2017.

We recently all went to the family beach house for vacation. SIL got drunk and was very emotional. At one point it was just the two of us on the patio and she was telling me about how sorry she was for betraying my wife in the past. She was near tears over this and just kept saying how she misses her so much. I realized, it’s been four years now and SIL is clearly sorry for what she did. In the moment I realized, my wife really shouldn’t be upset anymore. I tried to comfort SIL and the first thing that I could think to say was ""it’s been four years now, I'm sure she’ll get over it soon."" SIL responded ""does she hate me?"" And I responded with ""she could never hate you, you just know how she gets."" The conversation ended there as my wife came up to us wanting to play a game on the beach.

Later that night my SIL (who was even more drunk and emotional at this point) started talking to my wife. She said she had talked with me and I had agreed that my wife shouldn’t still be holding a grudge over this, and that she hopes she will be moved on from it soon so they can start over. My wife came to me in tears and FLIPPED out saying I ""took her side"" and didn’t ""stick up for her.""

I hate that she's making it about choosing sides. I just felt bad for SIL who really felt guilty for what she did. I really think it’s time for my wife to forgive her and let it go. She doesn’t talk about it a whole lot but I can see how it’s impacting the family and I know she misses her too. I’m sure she secretly does wish they were still close.

For the record, nothing has come of what happened in the past, meaning, the secret that was told by SIL didn’t have any long term negative repercussions on my wife. It’s hard to explain that without getting specific, but my wife was only embarrassed at the secret being *told* by SIL. But nothing else came of SIL telling it.

Now my wife isn’t speaking to me and she’s been hanging out by herself the rest of the trip. I don’t think I did anything wrong by trying to get their family back together. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for refusing to make a recommendation at the restaurant where I work?,"I have a bar/waitering job in a Japanese restaurant. The owner and managers are White British, as are many of the customers (which isn't particularly surprising, there isn't a big Japanese population where I live). I am Japanese, but left when I was a kid and haven't been back - I've been living in the UK for close to 20 years.

In general, customers respond very well to me, I'm friendly, work hard, and even though I've lived in the UK for most of my life I can do the whole Japanese customer service inflection/mannerisms without much trouble. However, I get asked for food recommendations quite frequently, which can be a little tricky. 

I really don't eat any of the food we serve. I'm an insanely picky eater and lived on candy/snack food as a kid (still do tbh), I've also never eaten meat or fish - I really have very little experience with Japanese cuisine. I can happily describe all the items on the menu but I have no clue what they actually taste like, nor do I have any desire to find out. 

I can usually get away with just describing things or suggesting they ask a colleague. On this occasion, I was serving a group who were very friendly and chatty, and for some reason they were really pushing to find out what I eat at the restaurant. I explained that I could happily endorse anything from the desserts/drinks menus but for the main menu they'd be better asking my colleague since I don't really have a taste for Japanese food. I made a joke about my ridiculous eating habits, it all seemed fine. 

As they were finishing and I was starting to clear up, the manager wandered over to ask how everything was. They were perfectly happy, but one of them made a joke like ""we found out this guy doesn't even eat here!"" 

The manager gave me a bollocking after they left and said it made the restaurant look bad, I should have just made something up. He mentioned that having one of the only Japanese members of staff say they don't eat there makes it seem 'inauthentic'. I didn't get the impression they saw it as a problem, and its not like I said the food was bad, just that it's not to my taste. AITA?

Just adding because I don't think it's clear - I already give recommendations based on popularity/ingredients/what suits certain tastes/etc. I am always very happy to do this. On this occasion, the customers were pushing for an answer about my own personal preferences.",Asshole
AITA for Getting Mad at my Dad for Searching my Roommate on Google?,"To preface this post, let me just say that my relationship with my dad has not been that great for many reasons. Some of these reasons relate to not having a sense of boundaries, not respecting my privacy, and being overbearing throughout my entire life. 

I am going to college and living there, so I will be having a roommate. Recently, I found out who that roommate was, so naturally, I told my parents that room assignments came out and the roommate's name. Their last name was a pretty uncommon one, so my dad asked me how to spell it. Thinking nothing of it, I gave him the spelling of the name.

No more than thirty seconds later, I get a text from my dad containing an article about the roommate (it wasn't anything bad, just about them getting recognized for academic achievement in high school). Instantly, I was upset, and I yelled at him, telling him it was weird and creepy considering neither he or I knew this person at all. I'm also pretty sure he was going to send that article to relatives, as he was talking about telling them about it. I thought this was extremely inappropriate and once again told him off for it. Even my mom agreed that telling the family was too much.

Being curious, I did skim through the article, commenting to my mom that this person was in a national language honors society (not gonna give specific details) and that their last name sounded like that language they were studying, so maybe they were from the specific place that spoke that language. My dad then chimed in and boasted about how ""you DID read the article, and you learned more about them, see, you're glad I sent you the article!"". I once again told him (a bit aggressively, admittedly) that I would've learned that just by talking to the person, and left the room.

Not even hours later, I hear my dad talking on the phone to extended family about the roommate, and about the comment on the language thing I talked about. Great. I'm not sure if he told them their name and sent my extended family the article. I really hope not, but I wouldn't be surprised if he did.

A day has passed since all this happened, and I am still really pissed about it. Am I overreacting? I talked to a friend about it, and she agrees that it was creepy and he overstepped his boundaries, but my family thinks that it doesn't matter since he is my father. From my perspective, if someone did this to me, especially someone I haven't even met yet, I would be super freaked out, but perhaps I'm just paranoid and letting my already strained relationship with my dad cloud my judgement.

Aita for not giving my ex our shared gecko?,"Long time lurker, 3rd time poster. Sorry for format I am on Mobile

Hey guys, I(18F) have three geckos , two are leapords and one is a crestie. My now ex(18m) and I recently broke up due to unrelated issues but I had our shared gecko in custody. When we were 4 months along we decided to get a gecko together as we both wanted to build a family together made of geckos and thus got our leapord gecko. We would alternate every month but soon I ended up becoming the main caretaker as I have 2 years of experience with gecko care and I'm working towards a herpatology degree. 

My ex had moved out and started demanding to have custody of our gecko but I refused. Right before our break up, I was out of town for the month and trusted him to care for our gecko but soon as I got pictures of him. He looked like he lost weight. I started asking questions but when 2nd week ended, he dropped the gecko off with my dad and never returned to pick him up. Soon after, we fought about it and then the break up happened. 

After this, my dad brought my geckos to me as I decided to stay out of town for the rest of the summer and I started rehabilitating our gecko by myself and without gecko support that my ex used to provide with me. (A side note: he would pay me money and I would get supplies but soon it got harder and harder for him to give me money for food and supplements.) Our gecko is suppose to be 20 grams and now weight 11 grams thanks to supplements and supplies I worked hard to get as he was originally 9 grams when I got him. After a few weeks, my ex started demanding I give our gecko back and that I'm the aita because the gecko was very bonded to him and I was keeping a pet that he paid for away from him. So AITA?

Mini-edit: I left the gecko in my ex's care due to trusting him with the gecko and I was going on family trip where animals wouldn't be allowed.",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting to buy my fiancee's wedding ring on my own?,"Throwaway account to hopefully keep this from being seen by anyone who knows us.

My (27F) fiancee (30F) come from similar middle class families, or so I thought. We've known each other and have been dating for almost 3 years and got engaged in June.

Last week she revealed to me that she inherited almost $2 million when her dad passed away a couple years ago. (For context, we could buy a brand new 5 bedroom luxury house in our dream neighborhood for under $500,000). She said she wanted me to know before we got married how much money she has. 

I'm not mad that she didn't tell me about the money sooner, I understand wanting to make sure someone isn't after you for that, and I think the timing (shortly after engagement, well before wedding planning) made sense. 

At first I was a little shocked to know she has that kind of money and I was trying to wrap my head around it. 

Anyways, she told me and we talked a bit about it. I was careful to avoid saying anything that assumed I'd benefit from this money. A couple days later she said she'd found a beautiful wedding ring that would compliment my engagement ring, and she showed it to me. It was gorgeous, but it was $6000. I told her I thought it was too much and she laughed and said ""millionaire, remember?"" 

I explained that I'd be uncomfortable having something that valuable on me at all times and I'd be equally uncomfortable being unable to give her something similar in value. I'd been budgeting $800 for a wedding ring (I got her engagement ring for $600) and I really can't afford to go higher than that. 

She immediately offered to buy her own wedding ring so we could match and I wouldn't break the bank. I told her it was a really kind offer but I couldn't accept, that I wanted to buy her ring myself. 

She got quiet and just said ""ok"" but then a while later she said she felt like I was being weird about money with her now that I know how much money she has and she thinks I'm overcompensating by trying too hard to not care about how much money she has.

I told her I just feel like buying her wedding ring on my own is important to me but she doesn't seem to believe me or understand why I feel that way.

Am I being an asshole by not accepting her money?

"AITA for calling my friend spoiled, petty and immature?","Before I get into this I’m aware that this argument stemmed from something completely minuscule.  Which is kind of what I’m upset about along with feeling disrespected.  

So, I (18f) moved in with my best friend (17f) back in March for an emergency reason.  Since then we’ve gotten along decently, even though we have our spats.  One thing I don’t like is that whenever we fight whether it be playful or real, she’ll scream out things that I’ve told her that were extremely personal and said things were told to her in confidence.

She has went into very personal things about me such as trauma, mental health, and my s-x life in front of her mother while we were arguing after I’ve specifically told her I didn’t feel comfortable with anyone besides her knowing said things.

So here’s the most recent situation.  We play “shotgun” whenever we go places where we have to drive.  She’s typically a poor sport when I call it first and while somewhat annoying, it’s still bearable. 

This time in particular turned into a bigger problem because she tried to blackmail me with something super personal into giving her the front seat.

For context, a few weeks back I had a sexual encounter with someone who I discovered was older than he initially said he was.  He was nothing more than a casual partner so it wasn’t a huge deal but I still felt a bit icky about it and needed to vent so I vented to her.  

She threatened to share this information with her mother.  Basically said “Give me the front seat or I’ll tell my mother about the thing.” I asked what she meant and she just sent: “the older guy.”  I was pissed off that she’d even threaten that and I straight up told her that if she was going to disclose that information when I specifically told her to keep it between us, especially over something as petty as the front seat, that would be the end of our friendship and I’d be moving somewhere else. 

She starting flipping it around on me and told me that I was being manipulative and toxic by threatening to abandon her.  She then started saying “I was fucking joking, calm down.  You’re making a big deal out of nothing.”  I told her something along the lines of “No actually, you are.  You took a playful light hearted game and turned it into actual threats about violating my boundaries, and I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if you did tell your mom about “the thing” because you blurt out a bunch of personal shit about my life whenever you don’t get your way because you’re spoiled, petty and immature.”  

She stomped out of the room without a word and slammed the door, refusing to go to the store with her mum.  I went anyway so i could help with loading and unloading the groceries.  She still hasn’t talked to me and it’s been nearly a full day.  Should I apologize?",Not the A-hole
AITA for siding with my sister?,"For some context, my mom was raised by an abuser and she has carried some traits into her motherhood.
So this has been going on for awhile. At first it was just little things like complimenting on my weigh or saying that I’m lazy, like every mother does. But it’s been getting worse over time. Her saying that I need to work out so I’ll be skinny for my wedding, that she pretends to care about me, that I pick and choose what I tell her, that I’m secretive and we aren’t close anymore. It exploded about 2 months ago when “she was the last person to know about my boyfriend at the time and I’s plans to get married next year. Then like the next week I told her I got excepted into a college I wanted to go to and all I got was an “wow. great.” Then that’s when shit hit the fan. She was sobbing and saying that she sees where she sits on my totem pole and how I keep everything from her. She is my “best friend” (she isnt) and how she sees that we are drifting. I told her straight to her face that’s she was manipulating and guilt tripping me and that she was playing the victim. That made it so much worse. She stormed out crying and sat in the car for over an hour. My boyfriend came over and asked if she was okay and she said “this is the only place that I’m liked” and then came inside and didn’t talk to me for a good 2 weeks. It’s been on and off. She always guilt trips and plays the victim when I confront her about something. I asked (nicely) to stop point out my acne scars infront of peoples and she said “well I guess I’m a terrible mother then?” I want to say yeah you fucking are so bad. She constantly hits on my fiancé all the time and it makes me so uncomfortable and I’ve voiced this to her and she said that she is just joking. Anyways, today my sister send a text to everyone in our family saying that she is no longer talking to our parents because of the mental abuse they put us through unless they show changes. My parents are no longer allowed to see her son and she is blocking them and told them to screw off. I’m spending the night at a friends house because I will not be caught in the middle of this. It’s my mother’s own fault for being a narcissist and manipulative. And I side with my sister because I get the butt end of her abuse. It’s not fair that my other sister gets treated like a Queen because she is the favorite. While I get told that if I get eloped she will never talk to me again. It’s bullshit that I have to deal with her and my dads abuse and my other sister gets off With a free pass. My dad and other sister are telling me how immature she is and who she is hurting is more then man helping and I just see them as defending my mothers behavior and shitty actions. They are saying that she is doing her best and that she has changed in some ways but they don’t see how much she is hurting me in my everyday life.

AITA for kicking my sister out of my family gathering after comment about adopted son?,"Some feel I (32M) should’ve handled the situation but I don’t see how I’m wrong. Me and my sister (37f)are  not as close as we used to be because of some messed up stuff that happened years ago. I had my son Jesse (9) pretty young. Months after that to my surprise my ex was pregnant again. Only I knew it wasn’t me because having an infant to take care of and provide for left me with zero interest in sex. And we found out it was my sister’s fiancé -ex now -that she was seeing behind our backs. It hurt. Worst pain ever but for my son’s sake I tried to get past it. I come from a family of half sibs too so I wanted my son to be close to his half brother (Keith). 

Surprise, not only were they (my ex and my sister’s ex) horrible lying cheaters, but also terrible parents. Both got hooked on drugs, only escalated from there. He got locked up when Keith was 3. This particular issue with my sister happened a couple years ago: 
My ex got sick, she was scared of Keith ending up in foster care like her and I didn’t want that for him either. I legally adopted him before she passed when he was 6. Not everyone in my family was on board at first but he’s the kind of kid that is hard *not* to love so they warmed up to him. My sister never did. She hated that I brought the son of her ex fiancé into my family. And I understood why it was painful but Keith’s and Jesse’s best interest were my main priority. That’s how we drifted apart. Last weekend was my birthday and had a small barbecue at my place. My parents have tried hard to mend things between us so they convinced me to let her come too so we can chat. I thought that meant she was cool with Keith because obviously the 3 of us are a package deal. 

I asked my parents how would she feel about Keith, they said not to worry about it. Again I took it as she came around. Only she wasn’t told he would also be present. But how could he not be? He lives there. My sister got there and she was mad when she saw him . She very specifically said “I thought this was family only what’s he doing here.” Loud enough where he could’ve easily heard but thankfully he was playing with his brother. 

My sister was pissed because my parents told her Keith wouldn’t be around. And I got pissed when she told me she didn’t want him here expecting me to do something about it. So I just told her to leave, and she’s not welcome here then. There was some back and forth from her and my parents. I didn’t want that kind of talk around my sons so still made her leave. My mom seems to think I was a huge asshole for kicking her out of my party instead of trying to work things out. 

Like they take Keith somewhere out of site while me and her talk. But to me, what’s the point of us working it out if that’s how she still feels toward my son? Well this is still causing some conflict since I “escalated” the feud by making her leave instead of actually talking to her . AITA?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA for not taking my sister on vacation with my mom and I?," 

My sister (18F) , my mom (48F), and I (20F) wanted to plan a vacation for a few months from now. We'd like to book it soon. The problem is my sister...she is unemployed, only income is scamming guys on tinder and snapchat (which yeah, I'm very against and keep telling her it is scummy and she NEEDS to stop but she won't). for most people close to me, I would not mind paying for them even if it is a large amount of money as long as I trusted them to pay me back. But my sister not only steals all the cash I have from my wallet and bedroom, but she never pays me back even small amounts of money. When I ask for my money back it turns into an argument. I don't trust her.

I was talking about this situation with my mom, and she overheard and got very pissed at me. Then talking about it with my sister later she was being very confusing. Saying she didn't want to go anymore, because she's mad at us. So I said okay sure, we will. Then she gets mad saying it would be really rude of us to go without her....so I said okay, you can come but you need to get a job. Then she says she doesn't know if she SHOULD get a job because she's very behind on schooling and needs to focus on that and graduate on high school. I said that's fine, me and my mom can go this time and we'll plan another vacation all together whenever she graduates and gets a job. But that's a problem too! So it's like in her mind we either find a way to take her with us or we don't go. She was the one who brought up the idea of a vacation though and we started planning it together, but this was when we though she would be getting a job as a server but it didn't end up working out. She also didn't show up to two interviews (one of which she got pissed at ME for because I 'didn't wake her up', I did...twice...but I had to leave the house an couldn't stay to make sure she was awake and ready for her interview that isn't my responsibility). I'm reallyyyy leaning towards just going with my mom but everytime the vacation is brought up now my sister has a tantrum about it :/ I've never been on vacation before, I took a year off after HS and was supposed to go away with some friends but a certain thing happened around that time that I cannot name or my post will be auto-removed and ruined all travel plans.

So he was walking and he got kind of scared and I think he lost his way because he didn’t see a sign he was supposed to in the dark. He saw another friend (THEYRE also friends). Went and tapped her on the shoulder but kind of touched her back because she’s pretty tall. She got scared and pepper sprayed his eyes. She realized it was him and they kept apologizing to each-other and their both over it because they understand the others perspective, especially since she has past trauma. Yet my friend (16f) didn’t think about it that way. She said the girl was an asshole for reacting to quickly. I said it was dark we just had a threat against our school and somebody tapped her back in the middle of the night she’s going to be scared. She said that doesn’t give her the right to spray strangers. I said whatever if you want go ask them how hey feel.

This is really upsetting because I am super close with my dad's girlfriend and I thought it would be a nice bonding experience for us. 

Now my dad and sister are fighting and to make matters worse, my sexist, homophobic, misogynistic grandfather invited himself as well. 

This makes me super upset because he doesn't approve of my boyfriend (who is trans) and makes me very very uncomfortable with rude and snide remarks.

Dale knows that certain things trigger certain forms of PTSD in me due to my childhood and then issues from my ex. Well, the anime he chose caused several of those issues to arise and by the sixth episode I couldn't stand it. I asked him if we could watch a different one or watch one of his favorites that wouldn't cause any problems. Dale simply told me that it was his night to choose and that this was what he wanted to watch. I calmly told him that I understand, but that there are scenes in the show that literally make my skin crawl because of what has happened to me. He just sighed and told me that it was getting harder and harder to choose anime that we haven't seen and won't cause issues for me. I already felt bad after that, but he continued to say that sadly a lot of anime are going to cause issues and that hes tired of watching ""chick anime"" despite us having watched animes like Hellsing, Elfen Lied, Another, and whatnot together. I asked him what he wanted to do then because I'm trying to watch them with him, but I can't help the things that have happened to me in the past or what they cause me to feel.

We have 2 children together an almost 2 year old and a 6 month old, I'm a SAHM, but do odd jobs occasionally like cleaning elderly peoples chicken coops, or walking dogs to bring in extra money.(I love animals so most of these tasks involve them)

My husband works from 9am to 8 pm most days, sometimes he stays till 11 pm to close, for a salary of 500 a week(before taxes). He hasn't been working there long, maybe a month, and after his first check it was only 870 ish for 2 weeks pay, I was a bit frustrated. So I started picking up more little tasks for neighbors, but there's only much I can do because I have issues with my bones. We get by luckily with us both doing this financially, but still find ourselves struggling sometimes.

We both feel like the kids and I dont get to see him very much, and the pay really isn't worth the amount of time he's away from all of us. He is always saying how much he misses us, and even on the weekends we both have errands we have to run, or chores to catch up on, so we never really have any down time as a family, let alone as a couple.

On top of that, all childcare is pushed onto me, even when my husband is off work, because he is tired, or has other things that need to be done that I can't do, so I have the kids then. I dont get a break from the kids unless I'm out 'working'. And I feel bad even asking him for help because he works so hard. He tries to help, but when I say he's tired I mean basically falling asleep the moment he changes out of his uniform. 

Its starting to effect me mentally never getting a break from the kids, and that makes me feel even more guilty, mainly because of my bone health issues that make physical work very painful for me after a few hours,so we had both agreed for me to stay home with the kids, so I feel like I should just deal with it. 

We have talked about all of this together, and we both agree that there is a problem,  we just can't figure out a good compromise, because he LOVES his job. It's the happiest I have seen him at any job since we have been together. I just feel like the amount he works, isn't worth the lack of family time, or my mentalhealth, for the amount of money he makes.

I did well on the classroom portion but I guess I only did nursing because I’ve been told I had to not being I liked it at all. My parents had paid for 2 years at this point (37k) but when I switched to CS I had to do a full 4 years as nothing transferred and my parents refused to pay for anymore school. I finished it and am currently less than halfway paying it off. 

My parents started asking me to pay back the 37k I spent on schooling because I didn’t finish the nursing degree they wanted and I’ve refused which has led to many phone calls of my mom calling me to tell me how disappointed she is. I told them I only tried nursing because they told me to and not because I actually wanted to do it but I feel kind of guilty because they only agreed to pay for college if I did nursing but I never finished it.

AITA Rejecting my best freind,"My and my best friend had been friends for a while and we told each other everything. One day he told me he was in love with someone, and me being curious asked who (I didn't know he liked me in that way.). He said no, but as he and I used to do I nagged him to tell me who until he finally told me.

He had feelings for me. I didn't know this and immediately felt bad for pushing him to tell me. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the same way and respectfully rejected him. 

He wasn't too happy after this as he went on about how I was selfish and rude and a bad person, even after apologising multiple times he called me manipulative for using 'guilt-tripping tactics' in my apologies which I was being completely honest about. Then he complained about me not being genuine as I was not writing large texts to apologise when I just didn't want to come off as desperate or confuse him.

AITA for confiding in my coworker about something my partner made me promise to keep secret?,"  

Throwaway for the normal reasons. 

I (32F) work in an office with 6 men, 4 of which I am responsible for managing. Everyone gets along well, we do group activities outside of work, everyone is professional. All around a healthy happy environment. In December, a newer coworker of mine, Zane, who I manage, met and became friends with my partner, Eli. This was okay with me and I was happy they made friends. A few weeks ago, Eli messaged me and told me that during a boat outing, Zane said “I wouldn’t be surprised if Throzenyougart wants to fuck our (married) boss, with the way she acts around him. Everyone else in the office thinks that too.” Obviously I was hurt, offended, embarrassed, among many other uncomfortable emotions. Zane and I had gotten along really well before this so I was really thrown off guard. Eli made me swear to not say anything to anyone, and if I did, he would “Block me and never speak to me again.” I told him I wouldn’t, to protect their friendship and Zane’s job. Also, Eli said Zane didn’t do anything wrong by saying this about me because it was his opinion, and people “are allowed to have opinions and share them.”

After this I was a mess at work. I couldn’t focus, was having a hard time talking to my coworkers, was anxious all day every day, and was being really cold. Zane messaged Eli and said “Do you know what’s wrong with Throzenyougart? She’s in a real bad mood.” Eli told me to be nice to him, so I was. After a few days I couldn’t handle feeling this way anymore so I went to a coworker I know well, Aaron and told him about what happened, and begged him not to say anything because it would be further embarrassing and interfere with my personal life. I needed to know if people thought this about me so I could have some peace of mind. He reassured me no one has ever thought anything like that about me, have never said anything like that about me, and he would never say anything and all was well. I let it go and moved on. 

Last night, I got a message from Eli saying “You can not be trusted with a god damn thing. Stay the fuck away from me.” Long story short, Aaron told our boss about what Zane said, and he got reprimanded for it, but not fired. This got back to Eli and he now knows I talked to someone about it when I promised him I wouldn’t. He is normally a very kind level headed person which has me feeling so unsure about myself due to his reactions. I feel guilty that I went back on my word to my partner, however I was left backed into a corner of extreme discomfort without anyone to talk to or help me. I feel like it was really unfair of him to expect me not to say anything, and sit in this discomfort while having to put a fucking smile on my face. I feel like Zane’s job and his feelings are more important to my partner than mine. But at the same time, I promised I wouldn’t say a thing to anyone. I need to know if I’m the AH for confiding in my coworker, so that I can repair where need be and move on. Thank you.",Not the A-hole
Aita for wanting it to be a little quieter,So my girlfriend had to move city’s because of abusive mother’s side of the family so she moved in with her dad. I come down every weekend I can to stay for the weekend so I can see her but currently when I do come down we are both sleeping on the couch because they haven’t set up her own space yet. They are all night owls and my sleeping schedule really isn’t. I feel like everytime I am sleeping and they aren’t they don’t even slightly try to be considerate of me sleeping. If anything it feels like they are even louder when I’m asleep. Am I the asshole if i tell them to try to be a little bit more considerate when I sleep and keep it down a little.

AITA for completely forgetting about my friend's birthday?,"Hi everyone. 
So, today is my best friend's 16th birthday. I (16) am don't particularly see birthdays as a big thing, probably because I was born on Christmas so I never celebrate it, but my friend usually takes it very seriously for some reason.
She organized a gathering for her birthday today and invited a couple of friends. I completely forgot about that too, because she called us a few weeks ago and I didn't write it down or anything, and then I forgot to tell her I wasn't gonna be able to go because tomorrow morning I have to take a breast biopsy exam since I might actually have breast cancer. About an hour ago she sent me a text asking if I was gonna come and complaining about the fact that I didn't send any birthday wishes. I apologized 100 times but she still isn't saying anything and she seems to be pretty mad. Honestly, I've done her wrong in other circumstances (where I was most definitely the asshole) but I don't think this one was so bad or entirely my fault.
The reasons why I forgot: I usually only remember birthdays when I see people posting about it on Instagram, and I deleted my Instagram a couple months ago because I was getting too addicted to social media, and also because since I have the exam tomorrow I was mostly thinking about that and about the possible results.
What do you guys think? I honestly don't feel like this is such a bad thing. I'm pretty sure she's gonna use this event against me in a future argument, saying that I don't care about her as much as she cares about me etc. Honestly I don't think it's that big of a deal, we're not married. But she probably does lol.",Asshole
AITA for painting my wife's trumpet?,"TL;DR painted my wife's cheap, old, forgotten trumpet as a surprise bday present and she cried, not in the good way.

This happened 7 years ago and we laugh about it now, but we still disagree. At the time, we were together for 5 years. My wife played trumpet (she switched instruments shortly after the story) in a rec band thru university and after. She had a nice silver $3500 trumpet that she used since Highschool. However, when she started in Junior high, she bought a $90 trumpet from a drug store (with her allowance). She played it for 3-4 years and treated it pretty poorly. It had dents all over it from when she got frustrated. Then for 8 years it sat in her parents basement, in a case, untouched. As we were grabbing camping equipment once, we passed over it and she told me about it in passing.

In my family, my mom made us shadowboxes of our hobbies as kids, so I saw an interesting opportunity to repurpose her old trumpet. The problem is that I treated it as a surprise. I commissioned my sister to paint the trumpet (it was originally suppose to be astronomy themed, but eventually just became colorful patterns). I made a stand for it and gave it to her for her birthday (we had been living together for 4 years at the time)... but she fell into tears and had to leave the room. It lead to some civil argument, but nothing heated.

There was no additional sentimental value for the trumpet that was revealed to me after. Her rationale was mostly that it felt wrong and she didn't like it, but otherwise she was not able to explain to me why she felt as she did or why it was important it not be modified past the obvious ""It was mine and you ruined it"". I would get the argument, had I \*thrown it away\*, but I truly feel like I was adding value to it as a sentimental object \*that was not being preserved for its aesthetic value or its functional value\*, especially since one of her most prized possessions is a scrapbook I made her the year before that involved some significant destruction of forgotten items...

It still plays well enough with a normal mouthpiece, and she actually played it when we were in a flamboyant  'marching band' (playing carnival in Europe), where it got a lot of comments on the street. I think its quite aesthetic, but I'm colorblind (which is why my sister painted it). Anyway, now its hanging in the baby room, and we are both curious what everyone else thinks.

Edit: For the majority ""Don't touch stuff that ain't yours"" sentiment, I'm curious if this is an absolute feeling or if there IS some threshold for sentimentality that makes a gift like this okay.",Asshole
AITA for needing more space on the checkout conveyor,"So this has been on my mind all day since it happened this afternoon. I'm not a confrontational person and I'm not really a people person, I tend to just keep myself to myself and I don't like upsetting people, or drawing attention to myself. Today I'm doing the weekly food shop on my way home, feeding a big family though I'm on my own at the time. I have loaded up a large cart, full to the brim. I reach the checkout and nobody is in the queue so I start unloading my cart. I should also add, if anyone comes up behind me with a few items or even a basket while I'm unloading onto the conveyor, I almost always ask if they want to go ahead of me. This to me is just good checkout manners.

Anyway, I'm about 1/4 of the way unloaded on my cart and already used up half the conveyor, so I'm slowly moving backwards with the cart as I pile more and more stuff onto the belt. Then I sense someone had come up behind me, I must have been in a world of my own, so I turn to look and a couple are there, with a trolley full like me. The woman has already grabbed the 'next customer please' divider and put it onto the belt behind my stuff and unloaded a few items of her own. I stop and look at the 1ft of space she has left me, and back at my cart which still has 3/4 of the stuff on it. I say exactly this, 'excuse me, I need this space here. I still have a cart full of stuff as you can see.'

To me, this was a normal thing to say. Perhaps it came out a little blunt, I can't be sure, but I was a bit disgruntled by her move in behind me. Okay I didn't say please, but I said excuse me, and at that point I felt she was being super rude essentially telling me how much space I am entitled to on the conveyor belt. Anyway, her partner/bf whatever just stands and looks away as she proceeds to reply 'oh WOW what a way to talk to people! So rude! I didn't notice!' and began to throw her stuff back in her cart. I literally just turned away from her without another reply, not wanting to get into a public argument. She was being very loud I think on purpose, the cashier was now looking over, her partner still looking away no doubt a little embarrassed as I was.

So, I proceed to fill the entire conveyor belt. After this she had moved back and I hear her exclaim loudly 'Oh so can I start putting my stuff on now?"" which I completely ignored. I placed the 'next customer please' divider at the back of the belt, with zero space behind it because I used the whole thing, and then walked the front. Bagged my shopping, feeling her eyes on me the whole time but not looking at her, paid and said thank you and left. I did not look back.

Am I the Asshole? Did I misjudge proper checkout conveyor etiquette? Am I not entitled to as much space as I require? Was what I said not polite enough in the situation? Should I have apologised for wanting my space?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I called out my parents for not visiting my 3 children/family more?,"I (38M) moved away from home (800 miles/1,287km) when I was 18yrs. Always tried to find a job back home but the field I’m working in has very few openings ever in the area and no where near the QOL/pay I make in my current location. I get 2 weeks of vacation and every year I use half (a week or more) visiting them through the year. They DO visit us once, sometimes twice a year at my home but only for 1.5-3 days (drive 13hrs straight to us and spend 2 days then drive halfway back on the 3rd day). 

They are retired and do have the financial means to visit more, I’ve offered to pay for their costs. They sell false hope to my children about visiting more and more, but never do. While we visit, they sometimes leave us to have their usual weekly visits with their friends for lunch/dinners and will leave us or have friends come over that we don’t know while we are visiting making it awkward. 

I am great terms with them and make time to talk to each of them 3-4 times weekly. I’ve never asked them for financial or any other help, they continually help my sister and will move mountains to make every one of their children’s games, run errands, babysit, etc, (by missing their usual weekly visits with friends) but fail to make time for us even when planned well in advance. My children long to visit them and beg them to visit us or have us see them all the time. 

My work is mostly on a “on call” basis but I sometimes have several days sometimes a week or more without work duty, but I need to be within 2 hrs to report so I can’t just leave to visit them. I would be fine with them visiting us and me having to go to work, just so they could spend time with their grandchildren.  I also want to make my own family memories with my wife and children and don’t want to use all my vacation every year to see them when they don’t reciprocate.

AITA for refusing to loan my boyfriend $5000?,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for about three months. We both love each other very much and I see a future with him. He immigrated to my home country about three years ago and is on a student visa, meaning that he has to pay exorbitant visa fees and full-fee student fees. His parents do not financially support him. I’ve always admired and respected his ambitions.

He was recently talking to me about money problems, and basically asked if I could loan him $5000. I’m extremely protective over my money as I work/study 24/7 to maintain my savings. Furthermore, my dad is planning to soon retire from the workforce after a heart attack, so I like having my savings as security knowing that I could financially support him if needed. My boyfriend knows that I have about $55k saved up and he also knows that I don’t pay too many living expenses besides fuel, groceries, and a phone bill. 

I told him that I wasn’t comfortable loaning him money this early in the relationship. He then flipped the conversation on me, getting angry at me because I’m planning on getting a breast augmentation which will cost me ~$10k next year. He called me selfish for spending money on my body rather than him.

AITA for moving out?," Hello everyone! About four months ago, my best friend and now roommate asked me if I would be interested in moving out and finding a place together. My mom didn't think that it was a great idea because I've been going to college online and working and she thinks that moving out would be a waste of money. I can see her point, however, I ended up moving out and renting a house with my best friend. We are having a great time and I love being on my own.

Some background: I am almost 20 and I have never really been allowed to have space of my own. My mom is a bit of a helicopter parent, and while I appreciate the support at events in school and such, she's never really allowed me to make a decision on my own. I can appreciate that she's just trying to look out for me, but even my college major had to be approved by her and I was the one paying for everything with my own money and scholarships. She also constantly wanted to know my grades and she would scream at me if I didn't do well. I already beat myself up when I do poorly on things and I really don't need to be emotionally beat down by someone else, too. The whole family knew that we were looking around, but when we found the house we are now living in and toured it, mom started making a ruckus. I told her that I think we are going to sign for it and she flipped out. We signed the lease and honestly, a lot of my fam have their full support behind me. However, I realize that I did not leave things on the best note.

Before I left, mom asked me why I wanted to move out, and I told her that I just wanted my own space. She got mad and asked what that meant. I was confused because I thought it was obvious, but I tried explaining it other ways. She just kept getting angrier. I hate conflict. So, when I started avoiding her and using school as an excuse, she got mad that I wasn't talking and asked what she did to deserve such treatment. So I told her that I felt like she was being manipulative and that I was sick of my life being full of screaming and of course I wouldn't want to talk to her when it's not even talking, it's me trying to explain myself and her screaming or crying depending on if she wanted to guilt trip me or not. It came to a head when, on the day I was supposed to move out, she realized that most of my stuff was already gone. I had been packing up a few boxes at a time and dropping them at the new house. I hadn't been hiding it, but I didn't load them in the car unless she was not home. She got mad and told me to get the last of my stuff and get out. When I started crying because I wanted things to end peaceably, she mocked me and asked why I was crying. She had to leave for a bit, and I rushed to leave before she got back. Then I sort of tried to avoid her for a while to get some breathing room and she got mad at that and said that me leaving without saying good bye really hurt her.

AITA For telling my siblings they arent allowed to refer to my son using the nword?,"For reference I'm biracial, as are all my siblings. I'm one of sixteen. All fifteen of my siblings are relatively dark, I am the whitest of us all. Like, blonde hair, blue eyes - growing up I was always called racist for having braids, and it has irreversibly destroyed my hair.

Anyway, I'm in a polyam relationship with two women and we just welcomed our fifth (and last) baby into the world. Both my wives are very white - ones scottish and the other russian. Our four older kids are all blue eyed with red hair. Our fifth baby is not.

My mothers genes came through on this one. Dark curly hair, dark eyes, and a notable skin tone difference. I never really post about my kids, but did end up posting a few photos when he was a couple weeks old. Family was immediately on it, complimenting him and going on and on about his looks and how perfect he is. Which they never did with my older kids. 

I took him around to see family (we like to let them meet, but they dont play an active role in the kids lives apart from that) at which point everyone started fussing. Honestly, I dont think I've seen my entire family in one room together like that since 2005. 

The name started up pretty soon, with the question of, ""Wheres the little nword?""

I tensed up and told them to not call my son that. They brushed it off, but it kept happening. I cut the visit short and took baby home, an older brother texted me and asked why I was being so tight.

I personally dealt with a lot of shit regarding that word, and I dont want my kids growing up hearing it. He is now insisting that we need to normalise and deweponize the word for my son so racists cant hold it over his head when he gets to school. 

I think its really fucking over the top, but almost everyone seems to agree, including our mom. And even my poc friends, who said they'd of rather their parents tell them about slurs before they experienced them. 

I dont think its fair, and I will give him the race talk when he's older, just as I do with all my kids. My wives both agree that its up to me - they dont personally like it, but they dont understand the full weight the word can have. I think that if all three of us agree its shitty, it shouldnt be said.

I'm concerned I could be doing him a disservice here, but I still dont think I want him growing up with the word used like that, so I essentially banned it. Call him the nword once and youre blocked.

So far six siblings have been blocked. 

The rest are effectively having meltdowns because I'm denying my son his heritage, and so I come to you. Am I being an asshole?

Additional info I forgot, with the heritage thing; our son has a ""white name"" (its Cyrus, idk if thats white. We thought it sounded cool) and they're also pissed regarding that. A couple of my siblings have expressed that they want him to have a more traditional name, and have suggested changing it. And are refusing to use his actual name.",Not the A-hole

AITA for showing up at the funeral of my mothers boyfriend to get closure with her?,"I (26f) had a pretty rocky childhood. My mom was married before she had me, had five kids, decided she didn't want to be with her husband anymore, screwed him over pretty royally and made that relationship bad. Then she had me with a guy who was into all kinds of messed up stuff. When I was born I had no father willing to claim me. She and her husband never divorced but he wasn't around me, he was around for his kids though my mom tried to get him to take me on too. I get that he couldn't. I was the kid of the person who fucked him over badly.

She had two guys in her life after and neither of them wanted me either. At one point the four of us were in the same house for six solid years and neither one of them paid me any attention. My mom saw it as okay because they weren't my dad and they were there for her and not me. It really fucked me up. Add to that my half siblings really hated me for what our mom had done and did not like when they came to mom's and had to see me. Then there was my mom's parents who favored them because they loved my siblings dad more than mom, their daughter, because she had fucked them over too.

So I grew up basically nobody wanting me. I had a couple of friends. But I struggled to make and maintain relationships and it took a lot of therapy for me to be okay. And I won't lie I probably still don't have the best idea of healthy relationships and still crave a family. But I'll probably never get to be that lucky. And that's despite my boyfriend being great and me having him as a support system along with some friends.

Three weeks ago I found out one of the boyfriends died and my mom was torn up about it. I ended up showing up to confront her because when I had tried to let it all out to her before, she had blocked me on social media and refused to answer the door to me or shut me down when I was still a minor living with her. So I dumped it all out. That she had fucked me up and chose men over me, chose to be with men who didn't want a thing to do with me, and who never gave me the love I deserved as a kid. I felt so much better afterward. It was like I could finally let it all out and move on. But my mom's parents and even some of my half siblings said I was an AH, via social media, the half siblings had previously blocked me, grandparents just never accepted me on there. And now I'm wondering if I am TA for what I did.

Now for some reason my partner is asking me to leave for not paying rent, as well as, telling their family that I'm not paying rent. I confronted my partner about this and they sent me a spreadsheet that they made of the rent payments for our current lease. Their spreadsheet shows that we are virtually equal in payments (a mere $5 difference). In response, I made a spreadsheet showing that they have paid about $1000 less than I have. This is because our landlord gave me one months credit when I was overcharged one month; this credit, my partner used to skip one of their payments.

I was paid minimum wage the first year and by the time I left I got paid 8.50 now everyone else was paid at least nine dollars an hour. Our hours got upped when COVID hit and we were all working nearly full time. I was promised a raise and found out months later I would not get my raise I was promised. 

During this time I put up with a lot from having to deal with a granny coworker to being over worked. 

Now I had decided to leave and got a better job. When people in our group chat found out when I was leaving ten of them quit that same day.

AITA for demanding my sister buy me a new block of cheese?,"So I need to start with some background. My sister is a very entitled person, she feels as though she can do whatever she wants, demand other to do things for her and that everyone should stop what they're doing to help her. 

A couple examples would be that my mom just did her laundry because she didn't want to go in her basement because of spiders. She requested that my dad deliver said laundry back to her rather then her walking the 4 minutes down the road to pick it up and when he said he wouldn't deliver it she asked my boyfriend (we didn't deliver, she came and picked it up). Anytime she needs to go somewhere she calls my parents to take her, or she will be out and have my parents pick her and her kids up. 

This all being said, we can get into the story. This morning I was getting myself and my kids ready as we had a friend who was going to come over and if she didn't we were going to the mall. As I'm getting myself and the kids ready my mom went to take the dog out and asked if I was expecting my sister, I said no and asked if she was here. She said yes and I braced myself for her, and her kids entitlement (the kids think everything is theirs, and that they can do and eat whatever they want). As I finished getting the kids ready my friend called, she wasn't coming over but we ended up talking on the phone for about 2 hours. Now had my sister not been here I would have been out in the livingroom watching my kids while they play and do whatever but with my sister and her two kids it was way to loud to do so (the kids are 4, 3, 2, and 1 for context, my two being the 3yo and 1yo) so I stayed in my room while my sister kept an eye on them, which is pretty much just sitting on the couch and listening if they're fighting and such. Anyways I went out to get my 5 month old a bottle and while I was out there, my sister was cutting cheese to give the kids cheese and crackers. Myself and my husband had bought ourselves each a block of cheese, one for him for work and one for me to do whatever with. My sister was here a few days ago and had given the kids cheese and crackers from the cheese we bought for us, not asking if the cheese was my parents or mine. When she did it again today I went off because she doesn't ask and feels that it's ""not a big deal, I fed your kids too"" I tried explaining that, that isn't the point and that I want her to replace the cheese. To be clear she used just under a full block with those two days being put together, I hadn't used the cheese at all. We bought it on sale and just want the money to replace it, or her get us a new one. I even said I'd take $3 rather then the $4 we paid since she fed my kids as well, and there was a little left over. She absolutely refuses to do either of those and doesn't see the big deal in it all. If cheese wasn't so expensive I probably wouldn't care, but seeing as it's almost $6-7 a block off sale, I want it replaced.

AITA for asking my dad for money,"I know the title seems bad but I promise that I’m not spoilt. So, this started about 7 years ago, I’m have always been the type of person to save all of my money and never spend it on myself but wouldn’t mind spending it on others. One day my dad asked if he could borrow some money for food shopping, and I said ok he said that he would pay me back and I was completely fine with that. Then he just started to ask for more to buy non necessary stuff like fishing gear or anything else he wanted and then end up not paying me back. I was fine with it at first because I was young and I never really spent the money but now I’m 17 and I want to start driving and need the money for the lessons. Altogether he owes me over £800. 

I don’t mind people like my mum or sister asking to borrow money because I know that they would pay me back the next week but I have asked him a few times if he could start paying me back and he would pay £20 for a couple of weeks then he would stop. It’s got to the point that if I keep asking then he would get annoyed that I keep asking. Both my mum and sister have said to me that I should just keep asking him to pay me the money but I don’t want to keep pestering him. 

Also, me my mum and sister don’t tell him how much we have in our bank accounts because then he would know that 1. I don’t need the money urgently and 2. He would ask us for more money.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to plan a vacation with my boyfriend?,"My boyfriend and I (both 24) of a year have been trying to plan a two-week trip for a really long time, doubly so now that we're vaccinated and restrictions are lifting. We've been looking at a lot of places, but we've been running into a lot of arguments.

We make the same salary. Unfortunately, many of my closer, pet-loving friends are no longer in the area. Overnight pet sitting in my area runs \~60/night, and drop-ins 2x a day would cost \~45, which does contribute to why my budget is different than his. 

While looking up AirBNBs, I chose a few cheaper options (<$150/night total, so at most $75 per person per night), but my boyfriend complained that they looked too depressing or not downtown enough, and that he'd be stressed living in them. Imo they're not crappy at all; they have all the necessary furnishings for living, have light, etc. They're just not luxury or beautifully designed. They're a step above either of our homes, for sure. They're at most a 30 min drive to downtown and closure to nature than downtown areas, which he said he wanted (to be central to nature and downtown).

My boyfriend argued that we should book someplace more expensive so that it's truly relaxing and only wanted to look at AirBnBs running $250+ (not accounting for service fees or taxes even), but I don't want to pay that much just for nice furnishings when we'll be out most of the day doing things.

I said that it wasn't my priority to have the best furnishings, and suggested things like splitting time in a downtown accommodation and a nature-y accommodation and he said it was too much trouble to move stuff around and he just wanted to settle down for 2 weeks. I asked if we could choose a different location or do a road trip or go camping instead, but he didn't want to. I then asked if we could do something besides a 50/50 split, such as him picking up the tab on one meal a day, and he said that I was being stingy.

I said that I didn't want to try planning a long vacation with him because he didn't want to work with my budget, and he said that I was being difficult because I COULD pay more and I just didn't want to. He said that it was impossible to work with my budget, and that maybe I shouldn't own a cat if I couldn't pay for sitting.

AITA for not inviting my family to my wedding and then trashing them on social media,"For obvious reasons I made a throw away account 

So I recently got married for context I’m trans (Ftm) my family has always been hoping this is a phase though online they try to act like they love the queer community. Even though I’ve medically transitioned almost fully they still deadname me and use she/her pronouns. When I got engaged my family was so excited as to them I’m the only “daughter” that’s been born in a long time. But I made it clear that deadnaming me or using feminine language would get them uninvited. 

It didn’t take long after my aunt and mom mad me a bride to be gift for me with my deadname on it, I snapped. I told them they weren’t invited and wouldn’t be helping me plan the wedding. They got hurt and the rest of the family quickly came to their aid defending their actions and how they’d have mom or aunt as their plus one and make sure my deadname was said at my wedding. 

When I told this to my SIL she told me why not have the wedding on property husbands family owns and just not tell my family. As in June their family has a reunion. I talked to husband and his family everyone was okay with it. So that’s what we did. I didn’t tell my family and didn’t post about the wedding at first. 

On my honeymoon I got angry calls and texts from my family about discovering that I got married because SIL had posted on social media about the wedding and how amazing it was to finally have me as her BIL. My family said some things way out of line and I saw red. I took to social media and posted pictures of the wedding and talked about how amazing it was without my family there and spilt how they’ve treated me for the past few years and how I was happy to now have husbands family as my own. I didn’t hold anything back I let almost a decade of transphobia pour out onto those post. 

I feel like I went to far publicly shaming my family on social media and basically calling them strangers I share DNA with. Husband and SIL say I was justified but I still think I went too far with how I publicly trashed my family and made myself to asshole by going out of my way to be petty.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not letting my roomate get a cat?,"Hi reddit!
So to preface, me (F19) my bf (M18) moved out after HS with our 4 friends, didn’t work out, so we got a 2 bed with our friend/roomate & been good ever since.
Whilst in the last apartment, an old roomate had an older cat and got another one. Now my bf has a slight & very tolerable allergy to dogs, hence we sleep with my 2 y/o beagle. When it comes to cats though, he has asthmatic reactions which either land him in the hospital or a breathing fit. After the second cat arrived, I brought him in the hospital at 11pm, stayed until 5am bc he was on oxygen, landing us a $200 hospital bill (now $400+ due to financial issues, fuck you America.) He was prescribed an inhaler shortly after this for this, so with that around, cats are tolerable but more than one is an issue. That roomate moved out, so he was okay for a while. Our new roomate begged and begged for a kitten months ago, we said sure as she’s a vet tech & knows how to take care of animals + the combo of 1 cat and his inhaler, he was okay with. 
Here’s where issues are starting. We have been in this new apartment with our roomate since April ‘21. We (bf+i) considered another dog for a while, more on his end. We all talked & collectively agreed that it was fine, & now we have 2 dogs & 1 cat. His allergies haven’t worsened at all since the puppy started shedding, hence further proving dogs aren’t a big issue. 
Our roomate had mentioned around the time we got the puppy she wants another kitten, which we said no because of his allergies. We eventually compromised, and said she can either get another small dog (We already have 3 animals!) OR a HAIRLESS CAT. Yesterday, sent us pictures of two orange kittens which we replied “cute what’s wrong with them?” (she typically sends pictures of animals) She said they were strays & wanted to take one home. Again we expressed no because of his allergies, and she rebuttled with “If you really cared about this allergies you wouldn’t have gotten another dog.” 
Quite honestly, it isn’t necessarily my argument to have because i would honestly be okay with another cat, but my boyfriends reasons are different. After our argument I showed, and heard them arguing until he just went into our room. He expressed he doesn’t want the cat for the following reasons:
1. His cat allergy
2. We have 3 pets in a 2 bed brownstone in brooklyn, not the biggest space ever 
3. She has a habit of leaving the cats litter box filled with piss and crap for more than a week and it triggers his allergies even more, + it smells
She went into the shower after, and yelling on Facetime with someone that were not being fair and “Respectfully if something catches my eye, I’m taking it.”
I’m conflicted, my friends tell me we’re in the right but I need further confirmation.",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking that while I'm at work my parents keep it down a bit.," 26, currently living with parents and working from home.  

So, essentially, about 6 months ago I lost my job mostly due to a drinking problem I had/have, and no motivation to perform my work anymore. I was working from home then as well, in my own place, and would clock in, go back to bed, and clock out. Got away with it for about a month, then I got the call that they were terminating me. Hated the job (over the phone outgoing sales), so I was mostly happy about the result.

Ultimately couldn't find a job fast enough to keep up with rent, so I had to move back in with my parents. Within 2 months a job landed in my lap that honestly, I really enjoy. I still get to work from home, the pay is sufficient (a little less than I was making before, but not in any major way), and I feel good about the work I do rather than guilty. I've been saving money, trying to pay my car off, trying to deal with the aforementioned drinking issue, among other things with staying with the folks.

Now the job is a calling job, so I'm still on the phone with people, but I'm offering support rather than products. I love that, and I get to help people daily. This is however where the problem is beginning to arise. My parents seem to not understand that when I'm talking, I'm not talking to myself. For example, was on a call with a customer about an hour ago as of writing this. My mother, whom keep in mind I love very much and appreciate the free housing of course, came down to the basement where my ""office"" is (no other rooms available for my desk and what not) to get a ladder. This ladder happened to be stored right beside me, and when she pulled it out it hit my desk, knocked a few things down and spilled a red bull I had beside me, all while on the phone with someone. This is not an irregular occurrence either. Shouting about personal matters, drilling, hammering, all within hearing distance of my office, while I'm clearly on the line with a customer.

A few things to add is that the largest issue I have with this, is I have ADD, and really struggle to focus sometimes when things are quite, let alone when there's seemingly a construction site 3 feet away from me. So it makes work harder than it should be of course. My work is tech support, and sometimes it can get pretty complicated and I really need to put effort in to focus in general so that I can do well.

On a few occasions I have asked if while I'm at work, they could try to keep the noise level down, at least in the basement, so that I may work in peace. These requests have pretty much gone ignored I guess. I feel bad because I am staying here for free. I have a drinking problem that I am trying to work on, and it's not going so well at the moment, and I feel bad about that as well. Sometimes I feel as though I'm using the free housing to enable that habit to be completely honest. I want to also say that I have been extremely open with my parents about this habit and have explained in great detail how much I drink, how often, and what I'm doing to try and make it better. I have brought up rehab, along with AA, and many other things as options. Those I know I absolutely need to make the final decision on, but without going into too much detail here, I would really feel better if my parents would hold my hand through the beginning of it. I know that sounds pathetic, and it probably is, but it's where I'm at.

I fully understand and respect that it is their home. If I am to move out (which I GREATLY want to do for reasons beyond the scope of this post), I of course need an income, and I need a job for that. I can't keep a job for long if I can't quit drinking. I also can't keep a job if there's constantly noise, cursing, and other things going on behind me while I'm on the phone with customers. It's made for an extremely stressful point in my life, which I partially moved back home to alleviate some stress while I deal with issues. At this point, I'm not sure if I'm the dickhead here, or if I should be expecting a little more respect/help from those around me. I'm leaning towards I'm the dickhead. I want my life to be better at all costs and if swallowing that fact is what I need to do I'm willing to do so, but at the same time, I don't want to be a pushover and not respect myself enough to demand that respect. Hopefully that makes sense.

WIBTA If my GF and I got married before her already engaged older sister?,"Im 27, my GF is 22, and her older sister is the same age as me. My GFs sister was just proposed to last week by her boyfriend of 4years. They plan to have the wedding in Fall of 2022, possibly, but unlikely, in Fall of 2023 if things dont pan-out. 

Ive already bought my GFs engagement ring and had it for over a month now. I plan to ask in November on thanksgiving (just after our 3years mark). My GF and I have discussed a spring wedding, and both want a short engagement, so I think Spring 2022 would be great. My GF would likely be okay with the Spring 2022 wedding, even if it made her sister mad. 

My GFs Sister would probably be pretty upset if her 5year younger sister beat her to the alter, especially since she was engaged first and we knew their plans. But I dont want to put off my plans for 1-2 years just to not cause some drama.

Their father also wants us to wait until after the older sister because he wants to help financially and doesn’t think he can if the weddings are so close together. Personally we dont want or expect her parents to help financially because they arnt super well off, and we can afford it on my own. So I was going to talk with him and let him know we dont need help.

AITA For Expecting Gas Money From My Co-Workers?,"UPDATE: ""J"" got his car reposessed today, because he loaned his debit card to his ex-wife, who gambled his money away using it, and then didn't pay his car payment.

I work long distance; an hour away from home. Each day (Monday thru Friday), I drive one hour to work and one hour back (about 87 miles round-trip each day). Two guys I work with live in the same town as me, and they're pretty much on my way out of town, on my way to work. Only a few blocks out of my way each. I've been giving two guys a ride to work; one of them ""D"" for about three months straight. The other, ""J"" for  about 2 weeks now. D's car was stolen, and he has since gotten a new one, but apparently needs to share it with his baby mama. So he needs a ride. J has a vehicle, but chooses to ride with me because I offered to do so.

Neither have given me gas money; not even one dollar. AITA for telling them either they start paying for half of the gas it takes each week, or I can't be giving them rides anymore? I feel it's disrespectful, and in a way, using me. Regardless of them being on my way (mostly), I'm still saving them a boat-load in gas money for themselves, and I feel that, out of respect, they should be helping out with the cost of gas.

Reason I might be the asshole: because one of them is kinda broke til payday right now, and the other is juggling two kids in daycare and his wife needing the car, so it's just the nice thing to do, to give him a ride. Thanks, all.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA for quitting my father's business?,"Background story: My father started a business from the ground up while I was a kid, and it turned out very successful. There's always been an unspoken expectation that I would start working for and possibly take over the business someday. However, the business itself has never been something that really interested me.

Fast forward to now, I'm currently working in it. This isn't my first job, prior to joining I worked in a totally unrelated field for a few years after graduation. At the time I joined a few years ago I was looking for other jobs, and my parents told me they thought it was time to join the business after working for someone else for a while. I was hesitant at first (again I wasn't sure if it was my thing, and I wasn't sure about having my father for a boss), but after some thought I figured it might be a great opportunity to expand my horizons. They also reminded me that the business paid for my education and I would never know until I tried.  I agreed, partly out of a desire to try something different, and partly out of a sense of obligation.

After giving it a few years I've realized that I don't see myself successfully taking over the company w hen my father retires, and I believe I'd ultimately have much better potential if I switch back to my previous field. Also, me and my father don't see eye to eye because we're two different people at the end of the day, and my time working here has strained our relationship. I want him to just be my dad again, and not my boss. Might be worth mentioning that I feel like he has his doubts that I will be able to run the business.

However, I'm really torn up about my decision and feeling guilty. If it weren't for my dad busting his ass to start this business I would never have had the same head start in life, I would have never had many opportunities (especially the ones I've had working here). It's honestly far from the worst job I've had, and I know my dad would not be happy with my decision. At the same time, I know I'll regret not leaving if I don't, and I think he'd be much less happy if I did take over the business and fail miserably.",Not the A-hole
AITA for costing my sister a job opprunitinity?,"I (31m) am a Ship's Engineer. I work 6 months of the year. Because of my job and the risks associated with it, I've made a pretty good life for myself despite not having a degree. Over the past 10 years I've managed to purchase a fair bit of land, a house, and 2 cars.

My sister (27f) has not done as well. She pursued a degree in the arts and has a pretty hard time finding a job. She's been in and out of jobs for years. In 2019 she landed a job, but she was laid off when the pandemic struck and her company went under, leaving her without income.

I live alone so I told her she could stay with me until she was able to get back on her feet. About a month ago she received an offer to interview from the university she attended (which also owns my college) as a recruiter. Her interviews went pretty well and the last part of the hiring process was an alumni/staff banquet to see how she handled social gatherings. She could bring a +1 and she asked me if I wanted to go. I'm technically an alumni so I said yes.

I bit of a side note, I'm a pretty rugged looking guy. In my months off I've grown a beard, longer hair, I have tattoos, and no matter how much I wash them, there always seems to be dirt on my hands. Regardless how much I clean up and how fancy I dress I'll never fit in in that environment.

Once we got to the banquet, I found a friend from high school, and she was talking to her potential employer. After she had a few glasses of wine I went over to tell her that I was going to move my car into overnight parking and we could get a cab home since I wanted a few drinks. As I approached her I overheard her conversation. She was pretty clearly describing me and my job to her potential employer, and her descriptions weren't flattering. She basically said that my livelihood and my career weren't worth talking about because I wasn't a ""real engineer"" and that the life I've built for myself isn't really deserving of the job I have.

I'm pretty used to hearing stuff like that. I'm not an overly educated person and my high salary compared to my lack of a degree is seen as a bit insulting by some. I mostly just ignore it but it felt different coming from my sister, and I very publicly exploded at her. I said some pretty mean things, I called her a leach, lazy, good for nothing, and told her that even if I don't have a degree, at least I can get a job, and told her to find her own way home before leaving. She hasn't really talked to me in the past week or so and got a call a few days ago that she wouldn't be getting the job because of the scene I made at the banquet.

My father and my uncle have taken my side, but most of my family is on hers, saying I should have waited until we got home, which I can understand. I feel like I may have gone a bit too far. What she said really hurt me but I never wanted her to loose out on this job. AITA for getting mad at my sister for talking smack about me and my job?",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking to be paid for babysitting my brother?,"This situation is a few years old but I recently had a conversation with my dad about it who still feels like I was in the wrong.

When I (20F) was 16 my father had a baby with my stepmom. For some context, my father is 50 years old and he and my stepmother both work at a job that involves a lot of physical labor and standing on your feet all day. They both usually work overtime which means they’re doing 10-12 hour shifts most days of the week. 

In 2017, the summer after my brother was born, I stayed with my dad (I lived with my mom during the school year) and I agreed to babysit while he and my stepmom were at work. She would work from about 9am-6pm and my dad would work from 3pm-12am so there were 3 hours where I would watch my brother. I thought that didn’t sound so bad so I had no problem with it until I realized:

1.) This was every day of my summer at 17 years old.
2.) My father would sleep most of the day after working and because my stepmom was at work I would really end up babysitting my brother most of the day. I would make him breakfast, play with him, change his diapers, and all that stuff so my dad could rest before work and then I’d still watch him until my stepmom got home in the evening. All my stepmom had to do was come in and put him to bed. I was basically like a live-in nanny.
3.) Sometimes my stepmother would come home and ask me to watch him longer so she could exercise, go run errands, etc. so I really ended up babysitting for closer to 5 or 6 hours a day.

I had intended to get a summer job to save up for college but I knew they could use the help so I asked them if they would just pay me like $50 a week for babysitting. They both acted really offended by this, saying that he’s my brother and they shouldn’t have to pay me to watch him. But I felt like me staying with them and babysitting was a favor/courtesy because I could have stayed at my moms house and spent my time working instead of babysitting for free. Plus, I felt like $50/week was reasonable (and honestly kind of cheap). My dad talked to my aunt and my grandmother and they both agreed that I shouldn’t be paid but my mom and my other aunt (mom’s sister) both sided with me.

My dad basically implied that he felt I was being selfish because I knew that they needed the help and I should have just helped them for free because I could but I responded that I was a soon to be college student and I couldn’t afford to do much of anything for anyone for free. I also felt like I was being used; like the only reason my dad wanted me there for the summer was so they wouldn’t have to pay for childcare. I didn’t mind helping out but I basically became a surrogate parent to my brother and I kind of resented being treated like I was selfish for not wanting to do it all day every day for free.

AITA for not taking out my nose rings at work?,"So, I'm a server at a pretty popular chain restaurant and I came into work one day. All seemed pretty normal until one of the managers who happens to be a close buddy of mine told me about a complaint the store got about the jewelry in my face. I have three nose rings in my nose. I was hired with them in, I've never changed them, and they are perfectly within dress code. I've looked over our dress code rules a hundred times since this incident and I'm 100% certain that nothing on my person violates company policy. I also get calls to the restaurant, praising service, as well as some pretty hefty tips from folks who just plain like me. I don't leave work on a day when I'm serving with less that $150 in my pocket.

Where I might be the asshole: When my buddy/manager asked me if I could take them out, I told him that I was really sorry, but I won't be taking out something everyone was fine with until a single complaint came in. I struggled for a really long time with my appearance and I finally look in the mirror and like what I see. I am dressed sharp and I am following dress code and I am always clean. But my buddy went to tell our GM and he's been sort of snippy ever sense. He didn't fire me or ask me to do it, again, but I keep wondering. Am I the asshole? Like I could totally take these out. In fact, I do when I shower when I soak them in cleaning solution. But I do that so that they're always guaranteed clean, at all times.

AITA for not telling my moms husband Happy Fathers Day?,"To start, I do not know my biological father. That’s another story in itself. I was actually raised from birth by my grandmother. My mom and her husband (let’s call him Will) have always been around since I can remember. I moved in with my mom around middle school but I still never formed a close relationship with either her, nor Will. To add, Will does not have kids of his own. Just my moms kids, me and my brother. 

Will has always hated that my mom would spend money on me. Her way of showing me “love” has always been buying me things, spending money on me, though I couldn’t care less about those things. Most of the time she would hide from him the things she bought whether it be for herself or for me. 

Like I mentioned before, him and I have never been close, nor has he ever tried. Never went to any sports events for me, it’s literally been a strict “I just live with you” situation. I’ve never liked him as a person or as my step dad. 

Throughout college my mom would threaten me financially that she would stop supporting me if I didn’t wish Will a happy Father’s Day and get him a card each year. Once I finally graduated and became financially independent from her, I decided that I do not care about Father’s Day. I don’t have someone in my life who was ever a father figure in my opinion. He helped me move states but that’s only because my mom forced him to because she couldn’t, and when I asked him to help me put furniture together, he lost his shit. So obviously did that alone. 

For my birthday, he doesn’t even send a text. He posted on someone else’s post to tell me, because we don’t even have each other added on Facebook (that’s another story in itself too). 

I truly do not care about this relationship with him and honestly it’s always been forced by my mom. The other day at a birthday party for my cousin, my mom out of the blue told me she was going to “whoop” me for not telling him happy fathers day this year. I’m obviously a grown adult and I told her she wasn’t going to whoop me and she said “oh yes i will” and went on to mention how I wouldn’t be where I am in life if it wasn’t for him. But really, the only reason that’s true is because she wouldn’t have been able to support me if it wasn’t for him, and he never wanted to support me through college and wouldn’t have if it were actually up to him. 

I’m truly fed up with how she guilts me and manipulates me. I honestly think she hates how she cannot control me anymore. I’m stuck still feeling guilty just because of how she’s made me feel. 

TL;DR: There’s no relationship between my step dad and me and I don’t care about Father’s Day.

"AITA for telling my Dad, ""I didn't marry my Mom. You did!""?","My Dad(53M) has a wonderful job that makes him famous all over my country in his field. This is kind of made my(18M) life amazing and bad at the same time but I don't care. Not everyone has everything and my parents never had a happy marriage. 

They constantly fought over a lot of things. My Dad never did any of the stuff a Dad does. He never did anything with us when we were young. He never went to games with us. We never played catch or any other game. He never taught us how to shave. He never thaught me or my brother(22M) how to drive (our driver did). He did nothing except throw money at us(not literally). 

Even when he had free time, he would spend most of his time reading tons of books or go out with his friends doing investment stuff and other bullshit. He never does anything with my Mom. He literally lives like a bachelor and has a family only for the sake of society.

Parents fight a lot because of it but I've gotten used to it but Dad doesn't change. I'm just tired of consoling Mom. Every time I go out alone, I think, ""Hey, Mom's alone in the house. Lemme get her something"". Even my brother does that. A few days ago, Mom wanted to buy something which is really expensive.(She works and has her own money too) but she wanted to go with my Dad. He didn't say anything and then a few hours later told her that he transferred the amount to her bank account and told her to go buy it with her sister (my aunt) or with us. 

This is where I lost it. He never does anything with her. I'm just tried of filling in and doing what he had to do. I didn't marry my mom. He did. At least he should take responsibility for it.

As a result, every cabinet, every drawer, every closet, is crammed to bursting. And so she just started stacking stuff on the side of the kitchen floor.

Last week, I said ""Okay, this pile has to go. This is like ten cake pans you bought for some Christmas thing you didn't do, and three gift baskets back from Valentine's Day, and a whole bunch of stuff I can't identify. There are spiders building webs on it. Some of it is food. Some of the food is bad.""

To which she said ""I'm a grown professional woman and I'm busy and you can't tell me to drop everything and clean up like I'm a child.""

To which I pointed out that the pile of rotting spider garbage had been there for five months already and if I *didn't* throw a tantrum it would only continue to grow.

She suggested that I kindly go fuck myself, so I said, ""Okay, if it's not gone by tomorrow, I'm throwing it away.""

Then she turned red and said ""I *bought* those things. Those are *my things*. You cannot just throw them away.""

I suggested that if she wanted those things even a little bit, she wouldn't have dumped them on the floor for five months. She countered that adults own things, I should grow up and accept that, and maybe if I had a job I'd own things too.

After she finished calling me a long string of humiliating names, she did clean up her pile, and I was happy about that.

AITA for asking my neighbour to move his car off my drive?,"Me (25F) and my BF (28M) moved into our (rented) house about 8 months ago. It’s on a terraced street but our house is semi-detached and the space between our house and our neighbour to the left is just wide enough for a driveway with a garage door. 

We liked the driveway because the area can be quite competitive for parking spaces. The driveway isn’t wide enough for my BF’s van but my car will fit just fine. When we first moved in I started to park on the driveway, but had numerous instances of people parking over the drive, leading to a couple of cancelled doctors appointments at the last minute. It really got on my nerve, but we politely asked people to move if we caught them, left a few post-its on cars and put a sign up. Things improved and as a standard I park on the drive, but if I have something important to do I’ll park on the street just in case.

A few days ago, I noticed my neighbour’s car pull up in front of the driveway. I wasn’t parked behind the garage door at the time but as a standard practice I’ll nip out and say something like ‘if you’re going to be here for a while, could you park elsewhere as we use the driveway’. If someone says they’ll be on their way soon I don’t usually care, and the only time it’s ever been a problem is when people get rude about it. It’s worth noting that the street was pretty empty at the time so it parking spaces weren’t scarce, plus the other person that lives in neighbour’s house has parked his van over the drive repeatedly, even after we’ve left notes. The conversation went something like:
Me (M) : Hi there! Would you mind maybe parking somewhere else as the driveway is in use

Neighbour (N) : Well you’re not parked there now, and anyway it’s not my fault that I can’t find parking with your car and van on the street.

M : I’m not really sure that’s relevant. There’s a dropped curb and you’re not supposed to park over someone’s driveway. Besides, if I have an appointment it’s not worth being blocked in.

N : Well you can’t have everything you want. If I can’t find a parking space because of your big van then I just park where I can.

M : Again, not really relevant. There’s a sign up, plus we’ve left notes on your van before so it’s not like you’re not aware of the issue

N : Well it’s not my van, it’s my nephews.

M : Regardless, you must be aware of it and still choose to park over it regardless. Whether or not it seems fair we pay rent which includes the rent of the driveway. If I didn’t have to worry about people blocking me in you’d find me parking on the street a lot less often 

At this point he’s just mumbling swear words and turning away so I call after him and say that I’ve taken a picture of the car and I’ll contact the council if it continues to be a problem.

Reason why I might be the asshole: I feel that the driveway is mine to use as I see fit but morally is it right to complain when I’m parking on the street sometimes? Also, I don’t know if threatening to call the council was too much.

Edit: I live in the UK so the council and police can be very slow about dealing with these things (although thank you for some of the advice as to how to approach it over here!). It can be quite difficult to park over the drive as cars will often park right to the edge of the dropped kerb, not to mention the neighbours seem to park more freely over the drive if I get into the habit of parking there. There are so many cars in the area it’s almost impossible to keep a lid on it’",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I returned the university of the fraternity chapter I was forced out of?,"I (23M) was forced out of my college's chapter of a co-ed fraternity just before my graduation. I had been in this frat for 3 years. Most of my college friends came from it and I spent many hours each week participating. I was a shy, lonely guy before I joined and it helped make me much more sociable.

Though things changed last fall. It was recruitment season and I really hit it off with this potential member (21F). She was very cute and we talked a lot, even inviting her to my place to hang out. We had a deep conversation about our personal lives and she even opened up to me about a medical condition she had affecting her reproductive system. To lighten the mood I made an inappropriate joke about it. She laughed it off and we kept talking.

Fast forward to last April. This potential member was inducted and we maintained our friendship, but we never hung out privately after that night. That month I heard from a mutual friend that she was upset at me for something but she didn't tell our friend what exactly. I texted her later to find out.

Only then did I learn how much the joke I made last year upset her. She noted other times I made off-putting comments such as when I tried to compliment her by saying that I find ""conventionally unattractive"" women like her beautiful. She also said she caught me staring at her chest several times. I was shocked and ashamed because I never realized how obvious I was. I apologized profusely and took complete ownership of what I did. She accepted my apology and, to show that bygones were bygones, she invited me to a party at her apartment.

It was a Friday night and I and a bunch of other frat members went to the party. I quickly made myself at home. My ex (21F), a former frat member, showed up later that night. By then I was totally drunk and got upset when I saw her since we didn't break up on good terms. I noticed the member who invited me and my ex were talking a lot. So I thought it would be funny to spread a rumor about them sleeping together to a friend. I quickly realized that that friend (22M) was the chapter president.

The following Monday, we had a private talk and he gave me a choice: leave the frat immediately or be investigated by the chapter's executive board. I chose to leave. I was devastated and disgusted with myself but cooperated fully, hoping I could still do the right thing. I lost a few friends plus my girlfriend at the time.

Meanwhile, I was awaiting a decision from the university on my application for a second degree. A couple weeks after I left the frat, I posted my acceptance letter online. The chapter prez/my friend DM'd me saying it wasn't a good idea to come back. I was surprised. The school was huge and I had already promised not to try rejoining the chapter. Still, he worried I might run into the member I had hurt. I said I'd think it over. I didn't want to cause further issues nor risk alienating myself more so I withdrew my application.

So I ask WIBTA if I decided to return to my school?",Not the A-hole
AITA for getting upset with my partners brother,"My (23f) partner's brother (m24) would make inappropriate and vulgar remarks every chance he got. Many of these comments were said in front of my partner but slowly every time we were alone, they would get worse.

He would speak about the size of his p*nis, say that I look submissive when I look at him, how he thinks that I must be flexible, etc. There were times where I caught him taking photos of me without my knowledge. He would also make racist remarks about my culture stating that we were wife beaters and that our names were weird.

When I first confronted my partner, I was told that these were harmless jokes but I felt really uncomfortable as I felt that this was s*xual harassment that was directed at me. My partner is non-confrontational and is not good at dealing with conflict but I felt like I was silenced. I understand that it's family and that my partner is not in control of what others say but I feel like I was not supported. We got into an argument when I refused to visit their home or be around him.",Not the A-hole
AITA for staying silent when my friends were jokingly teasing me?,"Hello guys, good day to you all.  Im M23. First of all im sorry for my bad grammar, english isnt my first language. Id like to ask for your opinion regarding things.

So just a few hours ago i was playing valorant with my friends (we're all MD and we're spread out throughout the country so we make it a point to play atleast 1 game a day if we're not oncall). I was saying something about wanting to get off instagram to take some time for myself, mainly due to the amount of drama regarding the various issues in my country. All of a sudden, everyone was booing at me telling me that i wouldnt be able to stay away from instagram due to myself being a ""drama king"".

So the reason they call me that, apparently is because i post a lot of rants on my ""close friend"" story feature. Im the only one within my circle who went and build a business for myself in the early days of college, so im always sharing my experiences (among others) there. Sometimes i shared about how this guy who wants to buy my product is being a pain in the ass because he's spamming me if i dont reply within a few hours. Yesterday i ranted about having an argument with my apartment's security guard for having his friends over and loudly drinking in the middle of the night. 

The day before, i posted a question to ask my closefriends whether its wrong for me to reject someone who's willing to pay an extra 10k dollar for stepping over a broker who's supposed to be mediating the deal.

Basically, almost everyday, i post something there to inquire my friends much like people when they post to AITA, or just a rant about a baffling encounter. So i stayed silent the whole game after they were, and i wish im exaggerating, laughed to my face for what feels like a very long time. They are my good friends, and i never thought me sharing my thoughts within a closed safe space which is my close-friend list on instagram story is regarded as me sparking drama. Please note that im staying silent because im just very confused as to how inshould react and rather than syaing the wrong stuff, i chose to just play as i always do, silently except when giving callouts and info.

Now, theyre mad at me for staying silent instead of laughing with them, while what i felt was that theyre laughing at me instead of with me. AITA? Am i too dramatic? Should i have just laughed it off?",Not the A-hole
AITA for being upset with my sister after she told me the second time she could not watch my dog?,"For the start english is not my native language so sorry for any mistakes.

I (f,30) planned a trip for my vaccation, the first after almost a year, with my friends. I own a 9 year old dog and since the trip would involve two days I asked my sister about 2 weeks ago of she could watch him since she is working from home like me. She said yes and it would be no problem. I was happy and booked plus payed the trip. Nearly 150€, which is a lot for me as I only get minimum wage. 
A few hours ago she send me a voice message, telling me she could not watch the dog while my trip.  I asked her what had happend and if she is okay.
She told me, she is fine and just could not watch him because she had booked a trip herself on the exact same days.

I way upset and asked her if she is serious. I told I've already payed and booked. She said she was ""Sorry"" and ""its not my fault, it was a spontanous decision."" I got a bit angry because this is the second time she had done this. The first time she told me she simply couldn't watch him.

So I called my mom and explained the situation. She straight up told me, that she already knew and my sister had told her this morning and I shouldn't be angry cause its not her fault.

I don't know if I'm in the wrong here for being mad at her. The way I see it, we had an agreement and she canceled it again, because of something spontaneous.

At the moment I don't have anyone watching the dog and I'll have to beg my parents again like the first time this happened.

AITA for telling my friend they need to pull their weight or gtfo my house?,"I  f(27) have a long term friend m(26) who lost their job due to covid. His family didn't have room for him at their house.  

He had nowhere to stay so I offered to let him live in my guest room rent free until he found a job.
I of course told him if he wants to stay here he needs to help around the house.

Now it's been over a year and the last few months he has not been helping much. Sleeping all day and staying up gaming and raiding the fridge at night. I feel like I took in a teenager but this is a grown man.

My nanny has now told me she's been doing some cleaning after she puts my baby down for a nap because he doesn't. 

So I told him he has 1 week to get his shit together and pull his weight or gtfo my house. He's claiming he sleeps all day because of his diabetes throwing his blood sugar out of control.  I get that but he's on medication. I personally pay for his diabetic friendly food and I feel if he's awake all night gaming he could absolutely do a few chores. I'm not asking he deep clean the house at night but I don't think it's unreasonable  to ask he do dishes and clean a bathroom. Just general helping out with chores. 

He's now going on Facebook saying I'm throwing him out during a pandemic and knowingly making him homeless. 

A majority  of our friends  are on his side saying it's  messed up to throw out a sick person  during  a pandemic.  I feel he's  taking advantage  of the situation.  It's  been a year. He could get a job or help out. 

Now with so many friends  saying  it would be cruel  I'm  starting  to feel  like maybe I'm  wrong? 

So reddit  AITA here?



Editing  to add
 I did comment on his Facebook  post that if someone  else wants to take him in be my guest.  Everyone  is coming  up with excuses  why they can't  take him in. 
I will say I am the most financially  stable  and the only one with a spare room but don't  feel  like that justifies having  to deal with it. He could sleep  on a couch.

AITA for agreeing to hang out with a friend of a friend then backing out?,"I've got a long time friend (let's call him J) that I really enjoy hanging out with even though we disagree on a few things. Mainly politics and religion. We tend to stay away from those topics but when they come up we can have a civil conversation and at least come to see each other's point of view. 

Around 6 months ago J's cousin(Cuz) moved in with him. Cuz was from out of town and looking for new people to hang out with so J asked if I wanted to come over sometime to have a few beers. Of course I was down for it. We didn't make set plans, just planned on getting together ""soon.""

Skip to a week or so later I was talking to J again and somehow the topic of flat earthers came up. J let me know that Cuz is a flat earther and really big into conspiracy theories in general. I didn't make a thing about it right then but later I let J know that I didn't have any interest in meeting Cuz. 

I try to be open minded but I just can't see myself having a rational conversation with a flat earther. Especially if alcohol is involved. As I stated before even though J and I have our differences, I still value our friendship. But, the whole conspiracy theory community just seems toxic and I don't want it in my life. J said he understood and nothing more was really said about it. 

I've hung out with J a couple time since this happened and he doesn't seem upset. I just don't want to be a shitty friend. AITA for backing out of meeting Cuz? Am I being small minded?",Not the A-hole
AITA for expecting my family visits?,"Background: I'm from a family of 6, parents,my sister, her two kids and myself.. Did not have any family growing up, everything was just the 4 of us. I moved 10 years ago about 2 hours away from the family. I needed to find a place with cheaper living accommodations.  
My family rarely comes to visit, only coming out once a year due to the distance. But they except me to be at every family event. Holidays, birthdays, you name it. I have invited my parents and my sister out here anytime I hold an event, but they never come. In fact, my sister has never visited me. Only coming once to drop off her kids so I could watch them for her. And once to come help me shop for wedding dresses, she complained we should shop closer to where they lived the whole time we went shopping. 

Anyway, I got to the point I told her I will no longer be inviting you to my house because you never come, and it hurts my feelings. She said fine don't invite me because I'm not driving out there. 
 We have a history of family drama and have not gotten along much over the years, but we have both been working on it this past two years. So this year I decided to extend an invite to her for the annual BBQ that my parents come out for. Her response ""No..haha... too hot"" I was so upset I talked to my husband and decided to cancel completely. 
Then too weeks later, she calls to invite me to a BBQ at her house the same day I was going to hold mine. 
My exact words were HELL NO. I couldn't believe it. 
My mom is saying it's no big deal and I canceled the BBQ so I should drive out there. I informed my mom and sister that I would not be going to any events at my sisters house no matter what. That if she care for me even a little she would put in an effort. I'm being told that I'm acting childish and unreasonable.

AITA for yelling at my sister for always taking the joy out of everything I get,"I have an older sister that’s a year older then me and I’m someone that gets excited a lot and I always tell her about things I’m excited about. Btw we are both teenagers. I told her today about the fact that I was getting £200 (I am only getting that money because I don’t have schools shoes and a jacket I borrow my sister) she doesn’t need the money I need but now she is saying she also wants that same amount too. I have always known she was the favourite due to the fact she always get stuff before me & my parents show the fact they adore her pretty clearly. She already has clothes, a jacket & shoes. I few days ago I gave her £30 to buy herself new pants (she’s gonna repay it back). But when I talked and vocalised my opinion and why she shouldn’t get it and then all my other emotions came out and my unfair treatment my older sister dismissed my feeling and told me it’s fair to give the same amount and that their shouldn’t be an issue. After so much convincing my parents are finally willing to give me money for them but now she wants it, it’s either we both share that money or no one gets it. I simply find that unfair. I kind of outburst and she got shocked and also brought up the fact that I never share my stuff and that I don’t know about her struggles and that instead I should be mindful about my words instead of being straight up selfish, I did say a lot of rude things to prove my point. I told her I would never speak to her again and that I want my money back by tomorrow even though I told her that she can give it back whenever she has that money, she doesn’t have a job or anything.

AITA for not wanting to drive my friend home?,"I've posted here before so hello!

Here's some context to the story. I live in a small town in Florida, where everything is spaced out and far apart. My friend group is only 4 people (including me). Me and my two friends live in the same area around each other, only about a 15 minute drive to one of their houses max. Meanwhile our other friend lived on the other side of town and is about a 30 minute drive from my place. 

I (18M) recently got my license and for the last year, our one friend, A (17F) was the only one out of the 4 of us who could drive. Now me and my friend, S (16F), can both drive and have cars. 

The problem involves my other friend, C (17F). Ever since A has been driving us, C has asked A to always drive her home, which is on the other side of town. And recently, if we were at S's house, C would ask A to drive her home. The drive from C's home from S and then back to A's place is almost an hour for her. 

A has told C she won't drive her home, and so has S. Now C came to me, asking me for rides from her place. I have a rule for anyone who drives with me, which is if I'm taking you somewhere you either need to 1. buy me lunch/dinner/etc., 2. buy me gas money because it's very expensive where I live. or 3. venmo or cashapp me. I can't waste money, specially since I'm from low income household and need to pay for college. 

Like A and S, I told C that I don't want to drive her home from our places. I said that if we were coming south and were passing her house I would, but I wouldn't drive past my house to go to her's, especially if we are at any of our homes. C has a lot of people to drive her too. She has a grandmother, mother and a brother who doesn't get off of his ass everyday and doesn't work. 

C of course was furious and called me an AH for not wanting to drive her around, but A and S both told me that I'm in the right here.

AITA for making my sister speak for her online classes?,"So, when my sister (6F) , my brother (13M)
and I (15M) had to do online classes, my sister hated talking out loud. So she wrote on a magnetic drawing board that our mum got her on her birthday. 

For context, I have issues with paying attention, and I do stuff without realising what I'm doing. So I end up needing something to do or doing something while I wait for the teacher to give out more work since I finish it quickly. I didn't have a journal like I do now. I never knew where the paper was. and I had no money since no one was hiring and my parents never gave pocket money, not even for doing chores and getting high marks in school. 

So one day as I finish some history work, I end up drawing a star system on my sister's drawing board. The problem is, my sister LOVES cool drawings, and apparently mine was cool enough that she didn't want to erase it. I told her I could just take a photo of it, but she insisted that she wanted it to stay on the board because she knew I liked to draw, and I honestly struggle to say no to her . We both knew there was no way we could convince our mum to buy ANOTHER drawing board, so she had to speak during her classes. Reason being is that her teacher made the students participate a certain minimum amount, to make sure everyone was learning. 

Needless to say, she really didn't enjoy her classes after that, since she had to talk. After 2 weeks of this our mum asked why my sister wasn't using her drawing board and she showed her my drawing, and said she didn't want to erase it. My mum can say no to her unlike me, so she had me take a photo of the drawing and then erased it. 

She still thinks I was the asshole for making my sister do something she really disliked doing. Both of my siblings defend me because all of them are aware of my issue when it comes to focusing and doing stuff, but my mum doesn't do squat to help me manage it, or let me get the money to manage it myself, and my siblings can't for obvious reasons. I don't really feel like the asshole here , but I'm thinking that I might be.

I posted the others because she wasn't in them and okayed it. Well dumb me left my phone laying on a table unlocked because the caterer was having trouble and I went to help him. My friend's sister took my phone and started going through the photos and videos I took. Showing everyone the ones with the bride in it before the wedding. She played one of them out loud without showing people first and the mother got pissed at me for ""exposing"" her daughter. Video in question was me talking about how I had no idea what bronzer was and giving general updates about the wedding party getting ready. Bride comes around into the camera to talk some and I said ""woah dude you got your boobs out, maybe don't get on camera"" because a couple minutes prior bride was in her underwear because she changed out of her clothes and I didn't see her put on a robe. I saw bride with a robe on and was like cool dude talk away. The sister cut the video when I realized she was dressed. I come out of the kitchen and find out what happened and I exploded.  Because of events in my childhood and the general breech of privacy this was I screamed at the sister for showing videos of the bride before the wedding and for making me seem like a creep with that video. The bride, her some of her family, and the other bridesmaids eventually heard the whole story and sided with me. The sister however being a daddy's girl and having her husband with her they stuck up for her and insulted me (called me slurs too because of my autism). Well bride had had enough and kicked them all out including her father. The bride obviously being very upset starting sobbing and talked to her fiancée and they agreed to move the wedding to another day. I feel like an asshole because I should have locked my phone and not lost it with the sister like I did. I also feel guilty for evening making videos and taking photos because if I didn't this would not have happened.  I feel so bad for everything that has happened.

AITA for having a meltdown?,"my parents (both 48) and i (15) went to nyc for a few days before i went to camp. in the morning my parents told me (for the first time) that we were going to the botanical gardens. i really love plants, however i’m not very good with busy places. i got overstimulated the night before and i just wanted to have a chill, activity free day. i told my parents this, minus the overstimulated part, and they told me that i could handle going to the botanical gardens. even after i said no multiple times, they still pushed me until i said yes.

we got on the subway and i was immediately uncomfortable. the crowded subways stress me out and i told my parents that i wanted to go home. we continued with the trip and i was visibly upset; storming away from them on the train. i tried to destress by watching a youtube video, and it worked a little.

we got to the gardens and the lady at the front area told people to go into a line. i was the only one who heard what she said, so i tried to tell my parents because they were having a bit of trouble. they didn’t listen to me, which made me very frustrated. i know that i can be rude when i’m experiencing sensory overload.

after we checked in, I ran away from my parents. they walked up to me and instead of asking how i was doing (i was literally sobbing) they started talking about the schedule. they do this a lot and it really bothers me. i ran away from them again and texted them saying i wanted to go home. since the next train ride was 40 minutes away, we decided to walk through one more plant exhibit.

when we got to the greenhouse, i decided to try and explain to my parents why i was acting the way i was. i can’t remember what i exactly said, but i tried to be as calm as i could. my mom called me childish for not being able to handle large crowds/loud noises. this really upset me, because my mom has said multiple things like this in the past. my dad was a little better than my mom, only because he was actually open to conversation. i tried to talk to my dad about how i felt, but i got shut down each time (‘it was only one activity’, ‘we do so much for you’, ‘i thought you could handle it’). 

i recently got diagnosed with sensory issues by my therapist. my mom hasn’t talked about this, and i’m to scared to bring it up to her.

i feel bad for ruining my parents day, but i told them i wouldn’t be able to handle it. they could’ve just left me in the hotel room (they’ve done it before for longer periods of time).

AITA for not loaning money to a family member?,"My sister, we’ll call her Kate, recently started a new job where she is considerably more well off than before. Not exactly rich but good money. 

Unfortunately she is in quite a lot of debt from her unemployment period, so a lot of her salary goes to that and she owes me around $700 which she is paying back in instalments.

Today she was telling me about a new laptop she purchased on her credit card, but had to cancel it because they messed up her order. She said that now she’s having to wait a whole month for the refund to come through on the card before she can order again, so it’ll be around 2 months before she can get the new laptop. This isn’t an essential purchase, she has a working laptop she just wanted a better one. She indirectly asked me for a loan of $2000 so she could get it sooner and pay me back like how she is now, and I skirted around the subject because it was kinda awkward.

I do have the money, I’ve been saving for a few years for a deposit and I could easily not touch it for a few years, I just feel like it’s too much money to just hand over, even though it’s my sister and I trust her to pay it back. It’s also a joint account and my husband isn’t too happy about lending money at all, so to lend her $2000 would probably take some convincing on my end.

AITA for not visiting my Dad?,"Background: My (21M) bio-dad (48M) broke up with my mom when she got pregnant with me but I think his family pressured him to take part after I was born.

I tried to go NC with him in my teens but wasn't allowed to (by my family, courts weren't involved at any point) and we tried to make it work (I went to therapy). When I went to uni he didn't talk to me for a few years because he ""forgot"" but he reached out to me when he and his wife were on a break just before last year.

We agreed to not to rush things and he visited my house a few times while my parents were present, then we met a few times in public spaces local to me as he lives a few hours away and I don't drive.

A few weeks before you know what he asked me if I would be willing to travel to his for once and said I could meet my siblings and we could ""play together in the park"" for five hours while he handled something at home. To me that sounded like babysitting which I wasn't comfortable with. They're both practically strangers to me and from what I've heard they're both hyperactive kids.

I told him that while I'm sure they're great kids I wasn't comfortable dealing with children I don't know very well but he said it wouldn't be a hassle because we're siblings and it wasn't fair when I would happily babysit my maternal-siblings and my godsister who is much younger than either of them.

For additional context: I was still visiting until his son was four years old but I've only ever met his daughter once as a baby. It's been years since I've met either of them.

I told him I would be happy to see him another time but I wasn't comfortable meeting his kids yet and he didn't speak to me again for nearly a year, asking me to call and wish his youngest a happy birthday as she ""misses her big brother"". The kids were excited over the phone but I haven't heard from him since.

Every time I interact with him I feel stressed and upset for days afterwards and I considered going NC for good but my mom says he isn't that bad and I should be more considerate. This might sound materialistic but last Christmas he sent me a gift that I actually liked, it showed he paid attention to my interests and was surprisingly thoughtful for him.

AITA for not giving my mom my bank account login?,"Today my mom [43F] got into a huge fight with me because I [19F] didn’t want to give her my bank account login information. 

Background information:
When I was 13 my mom decided to open a teen checking account which was closely monitored by her. I never really used it until I started working a few years ago. Ever since I started working, all the money I made was transferred from my teen account to my parents account. I wasn’t really allowed to spend anything from my paychecks. Back then I didn’t really mind because I was happy to support my parents financially. When I turned 18 I told my mom that I wanted to be removed from the teen account and I would make my own checking account. My mom said I couldn’t make a checking account and I would have to stay on the teen account. She said the only reason why I wanted a separate account was to hide my expenses. It wasn’t until a few months ago I made my own checking account without my mom knowing. Along with the checking account, I made a saving account. The saving account would automatically transfer a couple dollars from my teen account whenever there was enough money. 

My mom constantly monitors my teen account and manages my money. I’m not allowed to spend anything without her approval. I work on the weekends which I earn $1,550 a month. I had my drivers license for awhile but I didn’t have money in savings to buy a used car. So I was constantly relying on my parents to take me to work or use their car which was a struggle. It wasn’t until a couple months ago my mom co-signed a car for me. So I pay about $500 for my car monthly. Before I got a new car, my parents were taking my whole paycheck. My parents always guilt trip into supporting them financially, I wouldn’t have an issue if they would allow me to put some of my money into a savings which they don’t. They make good amount of money so I wasn’t able to receive financial aid from my university. They also don’t help me pay for my college so I’m stuck with loans. I once expressed that I wanted to save a couple hundred dollars from my paycheck to help with my college tuition which turned into a big argument. So I decided not to bring up that subject again. But, today my mom was checking my teen account and saw some money being transferred into a saving account. She confronted me about it and I told her that a couple dollars were being transferred to my saving account. So my mom asked me for my bank login and told me to cancel the savings account. I told her that I wasn’t going to give her my bank login. Which turned into a big argument, my mom called me all sorts of bad names and threatened to break my laptop and iPad which she knows I use for school. Also, my mom threatened to kick me out and said I wouldn’t be able to support myself and would become homeless. I don’t like disappointing my parents but am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole
AITA For telling my dad my mom got robbed?,"So for background context my mom left before Christmas to see family in Missouri and she hasn’t been back since for reasons that are too long to fit into this post. 
A couple weeks ago we were walking about a tattoo I expressed concern that I wouldn’t have enough to pay for the remaining balance on by the scheduled date (July 16). She told me she would find a way to help and I said okay but continued to make the payments for it (I have 200 left remaining that she would’ve helped with.)  
I struggle personally financially - my account currently is negative (this applies). 

Yesterday my mom asked me to put my account below -300 because I have overdraft protection and because how I needed that 200 and she needs 100 because she got robbed. She then said she didn’t tell my dad and she doesn’t want me to tell him she got robbed or about overdrawing my account. Panicking I told my dad because if she hasn’t told my sad then that means none of the cards are frozen or anything. Then she yelled at me, and while my dad tried to get ahold of her it wasn’t even her who explained it to him it was my grandmother. 

I really feel like maybe getting robbed was a lie so she got angry at me but I called her out on lie and that’s why she got mad. Also this isn’t something that happened several hours ago either she got robbed several DAYS ago. And never told my dad. 

I feel like I could be an asshole but this just doesn’t feel like something you should hide and then have someone else explain the situation. So AITA?

Edit: I’m gonna pop this in because I don’t want people thinking it’s about the tattoo - It’s not. I have put money on it and worst case scenario I just get what I payed for or I reschedule. I included that information because she asked to overdraw my account to -300.",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to accept someone's apology?,"Some background to this story: My friends and I play videogames together quite often, which has lead to us making friends online as well. Most of these friends are cool people, and we get along great. That is, until you catch them talking shit on their stream. One of these people, we'll call him Sam, decided that he would tell his stream that our group wasn't supportive, and that I specifically was a selfish prick. Now, this is hilarious because at the time I'd gained a small following on twitch, and consistently sent people his way to try and help him out. Another important detail is this: Sam is a pathological liar. Up to this point, he'd lied about car accidents, being shot 6 times, marital issues, and being involved in a gaming organization which I won't name here  When I called him out for talking about me behind my back, I also unmodded him from my streams, and discord. Sam then got mad at me, but waited a few weeks before leaving the server. Sooner or later, quite a few people had left our group, and our discord server as well. I hadn't talked to Sam, or anyone who had left, for weeks after this. Then, out of nowhere Sam started messaging me through Call of Duty, but it was spam. It was annoying, and i was having a good time with some friends, so i paid it no mind. 
Then Sam started joining on us mid-game, and attempting to communicate with us. I muted him, and continued with my friends, hoping to avoid this dramatic person. 
After a while of Sam joining on us mid-game, and him messaging me on Call of Duty, finally it stopped. And by a while, i mean it took almost a half hour. 
I soon got a private message on Discord. It was from Sam. 

Sam: ""I'm out here trying to apologize, cause i just lost my cousin and my son. Holding grudges is pointless, but i guess you're too good to listen to what i have to say."" 

Me: ""There's no grudge. It isn't worth me being mad about, or wasting my energy on. With that being said, I'm still not going to associate with you. I once considered you a close friend, but you abused my trust by going behind my back to talk about issues that no one else had business knowing...while live on the internet. This will be the last time I respond to anything you send me. I truly wish you the best of luck online, and in life.""

I just found out that not only Sam has still constantly been talking shit about myself, and those left in our group (Most of which are new, and he wouldn't know in the first place), but some of the others, whom i knew outside of the internet and had helped me move multiple times, had been talking shit as well.

AITA for emancipating my mom?,"My mom has always been a bit mentally unstable and I had a decently rough childhood due to divorce and split custody and whatnot, but that isn't the point. Recently, my mom has filed a court case against my father for many things such as denial of communication, not checking with my mom before major medical decisions (which was only vaccines), and denial of transport. 

My father is no longer able to transport us due to his being disabled with many back problems and for her to use this point against him had me confused. the denial of communication was when my sister was having a mental breakdown and he took her to the hospital and told my mom to stay away because she was chasing him down the highway, she made such a big fuss the hospital wouldn't even see my sister.

 and the vaccines that she said she never approved, she did, and there's written document signed proof. And my dad doesn't have enough money for an attorney for this case so it is coming out of my college fund and my sisters college fund because that's the only spare money we have left. 5000-20000$ wasted. When I called her about it, I called her out on some invalid points but I wasn't aware of the full context.

 she said she didn't care if I read the divorce papers and some other agreements and it changed everything. she told me to my face that she wasn't in it for the money but the main this she was going after was child support money from my father for when we were living WITH HIM.

She wanted money for taking care of us while she wasn't taking care of us, yeah.... Anyway, she straight up lied to me and the only way to void this court case is if me and my siblings emancipated ourselves. This had put a lot of stress on me a 17 year old kid but in the end I deemed it necessary. Was I in the wrong?",Not the A-hole
AITA for changing my mind about driving for my friend’s birthday celebration?,"My friend (who I’ll refer to as L) is having a birthday celebration at the local amusement park on Saturday. I have been invited, and they promised to pay for gas if I drove everyone there in the morning, which I initially agreed to. 

Last night, I got my work schedule for the week, and I work on Saturday afternoon, a few hours after I would be driving everyone. I told L that since I have work, I can’t go to the amusement park. They asked if I could still drive everyone in the morning, and said that they would compensate for my time and gas. I refused, because I don’t find it fair to be the driver to an event that I can’t even go to.

L asked if I could just go in the morning and leave early, which makes sense, but again, I refused, because I would want to get the most out of my ticket (we all have to pay for our own tickets).

L says I’m TA because I’m refusing to drive them even though I originally agreed, that I’m still able to do it in the morning, and without me them and their friends probably won’t have a ride there.

AITA?

UPDATE: I gently asked them if they would consider rescheduling the amusement park and just have a little get-together on their actual birthday, and they got incredibly upset and defensive. We’ve been arguing a lot recently, and I don’t really want to be around them this week anyway (to avoid further conflict).",Not the A-hole
AITA for being so open with my sisters fiancé?,"Okay so I’m open to all judgements and opinions on this because my intentions weren’t bad but have caused serious issues with my sister. 

Long story short, my sisters boyfriend has been in county jail for about six months. Recently, they secretly got engaged. She has a ring and everything but isn’t telling anyone. I recently started talking to him. 

I talked to him a lot. He treats my sister really well and really cares about her. Any way were both bipolar (both medicated) and he offered to be there for me and talk to me whenever I was having issues because he can relate so we became pretty close for the circumstances. 

We regularly talk about my sister obviously and I’ve shared some embarrassing stories and details that she laughed about. Well recently when I talked to him, I was in a really heavy mixed episode (both manic and depressed at the same time) and if anyone knows anything about mania, you have absolutely no filter and pair that with the “nothing matters” mindset of depression, you have a recipe for chaos. 

So we were on the phone one night and we were talking about my sister and her anxiety came up in conversation. We were talking about how she worries about the smallest things to extremes. Me thinking “hey this is my sisters fiancé and he should understand her” I was really open with him and explained that a lot of it probably comes from how her ex treated her. I told him that she was so worried about being the best girlfriend to him that when I posted a family picture on Instagram, she asked me to delete it because she thought she looked fat and didn’t want his friends to see it. I eventually had to have his friends unfollow me which I guess you can do now so they wouldn’t see it. I told him that he needs to help build up my sisters self confidence and he promised he would. I sent him the picture too because it was a cute family photo and I knew he would think she looked beautiful and tell her so. 

Well anyway he asked me what friends of his I followed and I told him. Turns out one of those people were very much not his friend and when I had talked to him with my sister she also thought he was his friend. They made a pact to stop talking when she found out as long as she never told her fiancé because they have BEEF. 

Anyway long story short, my sisters fiancé confronted my sister about talking to that guy because of me and she got so mad at me for spilling the beans. I honestly didn’t know they weren’t friends. She told me I could never talk to him again and I was out of line. Then when the picture went through because it takes a couple days, she got double mad at me for sending him a picture of herself she didn’t like. 

Look my reasoning and judgement behind all this is a little blurred because of my mental state and maybe I over shared, but in my opinion, if she is supposedly going to share the rest of her life with someone, why is she hiding ANYTHING from him? Like good and bad?",Asshole
AITA for going on vacation with a friend of my best friend without her?,"Hi, so this situation is a bit complicated. Basically I have a best friend let's call her Anna and she has really strict parents. They don't allow her anything. She ist 18 and isn't even allowed to leave the house without there permission. Anna has another friend lets call her Emily. They have been friends for about 2 years but have never met. Emily and I became friends about 7 months ago.

 All of my interactions with Anna and Emily are over Skype because Anna isn't allowed to leave the house and Emily lives about 5 hours away. We Skype together all the time, but the other day Anna couldn't join us because her family was visiting. 

So Emily and I Skyped alone. We are very similar people especially in terms of spontaneously doing things. We both don't work this August so we had the idea to go on vacation together. 3 hours later we had booked our flight and hotel in Venice, Italy. We were really excited and told Anna when she joined us after her visitors left.

 She wasn't. She cried and hung up. Look the thing is I love Anna but I don't wanna spend every day in my room because she has to.  I understand that she is upset that we go on vacation without her because she has been friends with us individually longer and we are Basically a trio but I don't wanna miss out on this experience because her parents don't allow her to go to. She asked us to cancel it and wait until next year so we can all go together because she hopes her parents let her do more when she is 19.

Aita for not feeling bad that my girlfriend is having a hard time at work,"My girlfriend works at Unnamed International Coffee Corporation and works part time there. She works about 5-8 hours a day for a total of 25-30 hours a week. 

I work at Unamed International Warehouse Corporation and I work 10-12 hour days up to 70 hours a week on occasion. I’m not trying to compare us and I don’t expect her to do all the things I do, however. She complains a lot that work is hard and her legs hurt, and I never run my mouth about how easy her job is I’m not a dick about it. But when she asks me to go somewhere or to get something and I’ve just clocked out of a 10 hour shift I’m not usually obliging. Then she’ll tell me that her legs hurt and she was working all day and I’ll inform her that I had worked a long day in a warehouse and that’s why my legs hurt.

She’ll become upset and say “I’m trying to one up her” and “I don’t care about what she’s going through” which I do but I’m just trying to let her know I’m exhausted and would just like for her to handle whatever said things it is.

But to be honest, I don’t feel bad if her most difficult experiences are a rude customer when mine are unloading freight trucks by hand from China. Does that make me the bad guy?

WIBTA if I stopped going to family reunions unless my mom changes her attitude towards my service dog?,"I (19M) am autistic and have a couple other neurological disorders and disabilities (including PTSD, chronic migraines and a heightened risk of falling). I have a service dog that is trained to help me with sensory overloads, PTSD flashbacks, alert to migraines and get help when I fall (amongst other stuff). 

My mom has a Labrador who gets along super well my SD but when they play with each other she sheds a lot of hair. She is not well trained at all and won't stop trying to play with him, even when he's working.

My family usually gathers every weekend to have lunch together. We used to do that in my grandma's house bit because of the pandemic we are now doing it in my mom's house. 

I usually take my service dog pretty much everywhere with me and that has significantly decreased the frequency in which I have to take my emergency panic attack meds (which are benzos so really strong meds). My mom however doesn't like the mess that her dog and my SD make when they're together and said I can't bring him to the lunches at her house. I tried to offer to host the lunches at my place but she said that that won't work because it's too small. I suggested a number of other options, including keeping her dog in the crate and having lunch somewhere else but she insists on her house and said I don't need to bring him because ""It's just a couple of hours and anyways why would you have a panic attack here?"".

This is really bothering me and I'm seriously considering the possibility of just stopping to go altogether but my mom would get really offended and it would significantly reduce the amount of time I spend with her (other than that we get along super well). Would I be the asshole if I stopped going?

Edit to clarify sone stuff: My mom does care about my well being but she genuinely doesn't understand the disorders I have and the huge role my dog has in helping me (I've tried to explain but I don't think she really understood).

AITA: Got Called Racist In Vegas,"Who’s the asshole here?

I was in Vegas and walking on the strip.  This young black guy approached me and tried to get me to take a CD of his.  I politely refused because I was walking on the strip doing stuff and to be honest I don’t have a single CD player in my house, car, … anywhere.  And if I’m completely honest I just don’t take stuff like this. 

He kept insisting that I take it and I said “I probably wouldn’t like it anyways”.   Probably not the most eloquent thing to say, but here is my reasoning:

I said I probably wouldn’t like it anyways because I’m into a lot of really heavy stuff.  I love bands like Cradle of Filth, Lamb of God, Trivium, stuff like that.  Stuff that if you asked 100 random people, maybe 2 would have even heard of these band names.  I know this because I don’t even bother to advertise what I like in my real life because it just leads to questions and more questions haha. 

So I said I wouldn’t like it thinking that this guy, black or not, wouldn’t come close to liking my type of music.  I really just wanted to get on with my night and was trying to be polite and squirm out of the situation without straight up telling this guy to piss off and he’s annoying me.  

The guy then screams at me, calls me a racist and makes a big scene in the middle of the strip. People are looking.  He says he loves heavy metal, lists a few super main stream bands like A7X, flips me off, says how dare I assume he doesn’t like metal because he’s black, says that not “every black man is pushing rap cds”, and leaves.  I never mentioned rap. 

Here’s the twist, that wasn’t the case at all.  I guess I was stereotyping him against EVERYBODY in the word ie: metal head vs non-metal heads.  But he was stereotyping me a white guy being racist against a black guy and assumed that I thought that it would just be rap music because he was black.

I was Switzerland and no one could change that.

I was at home and knew that my brother had gone out to one of his best friends house but I told her that I was at my grandparents having dinner and I had no idea if he was asleep. Eventually they figured things out last weekend and somehow she found out I was at home that day and knew he had gone out and she got mad for lying but as I always tell her I’m Switzerland and I’m not getting in the middle.

AITA for being upset about a party I didn't want?,"I recently turned 40, and my boyfriend threw a surprise party with about 30 people (mostly friendly acquaintances from work rather than close friends, of which I don't have many). I have been dealing with heightened social anxiety coming out of the pandemic, and have made it abundantly clear that I am not ready to go to bars or be indoors around a lot of people. (I never particularly liked crowds to begin with, but could usually deal with it before.) So of course being stuck in a small space with a bunch of people was not the kind of surprise I expected.

Not wanting to ruin the experience for everyone, I did the best I could. I socialized and smiled and laughed and such, and took occasional moments to step away and breathe. The next day (ok, few days) I was beyond exhausted. I was withdrawn and cranky. I snapped at my boyfriend for something stupid and it led to an argument about how I dont think he's being understanding about how I've been feeling, countered with how I've ""been this way for 10 years"" and how ""everything he does is wrong."" All I even criticized him for was that I really didn't want to be shoved into that situation and thought he should get that by now, and that what I really needed was a hug and some support. His defense was that he thought it would help me to just be around people I knew.

I didn't even get into being disappointed that not only did he put me in an uncomfortable spot, he didn't seem to try to do anything to make it more comfortable or personal for me (for example, serve food he knows makes me happy instead of generic takeout from next door). I truly didn't want to hurt his feelings when I knew he was trying to do something for me, but I couldn't help but feel like the whole thing was kind of done without ME really in mind.

AITA For refusing to help my cousin catfish her young daughter and telling her to stop lying to her kids.,"Just a little background info: I am 24 F and my cousin is in her early 40's. We hardly ever talk but I am close to her son so we still have to interact every so often. 

Earlier this week I received a long message from my cousin asking me for a HUGE favor. She explained that her young daughter has been using social media to find other young kids to talk with. My Cousin asked me to create a snapchat, pretend to be a 10 year old boy, get her daughter to talk to me about personal things and then do something to scare her. I felt this was wrong so I refused and told Cousin that her daughter deserves an honest conversation. I also recommend that my Cousin stop trying to use lies to parent her children and not to include me when she does. Cousin asked me not to speak to Daughter or Son from now on because Cousin doesn't want Daughter finding out that anyone knows.  Cousin then proceeded to shame ME and tell me that I will most likely be the reason Daughter hates Cousin and ends up running away at 13 years old with an older man just like Cousin did at that age.

He was scaring my kids and I got defensive. I open my door and go outside and yell at him to get off my property. I also told him he could have let us know in a civil manner.

AITA for not responding for a few days?,"(on mobile so apology in advance for any formatting or spelling mistakes)

Even though I’ve been managing a lot better over the years, I (20f) have always struggled with messaging people back on time when my mental health is getting worse. Due to personal reasons this happened again about 2 weeks ago and I didn’t get back to a few people. 

One of those being Emily (20-24f, fake name). I know her because we’re on the same team in an online game we both play, but other than that, we’ve never talked privately. Emily wanted to try digital art and since I do creative jobs as a side gig I offered to show her some basics through videos and voice messages and followed through with that promise. She created an artwork for said online game and wanted to submit it (there’s a „contest“ every month where you can submit art to be used in game. You can always submit your art again if it isn’t chosen) and asked me how to format it a few days later.

Unfortunately that happened at a time where I was feeling like absolute shit. A lot of struggles from my personal life came up around the same time and I basically just opened WhatsApp, got back to 2-3 people that it showed me at the top and that was it. This included many of my real life friends who know that this is a struggle of mine and don’t take it personally. (Also I am working on that behavior and it very rarely happens nowadays).

Well, Emily did. Even though I was generally MIA, she seems to think it was something against her. She messaged a mutual friend and said she was “sick of this childish behavior”, that she has been “barely sleeping since the weekend she texted me” and “crying almost all the time, both out of frustration and anger from feeling betrayed”.

Personally, I believe this reaction is very much unjustified and over the top. She didn’t get a response from me, and that might make me the AH, but there were many problems and important deadlines in my personal life coming up around the same time and explaining to her how to format a drawing was really not a priority to me. It was very easy to just google how to do it and we genuinely never talked beforehand so I have no idea why she has such a strong emotional reaction to me not responding. She found out from said mutual friend that I had personal struggles, which is where the “I’m sick of this childish behavior” came from. 

In my eyes, this is a grown woman and a stranger to me- I have no idea what she looks like or even how old she is exactly. Why should she be more entitled to my response than my actual friends? I still haven’t gotten back to her, because simply put, I have no idea how. I’m at a loss for words regarding her reaction and also don’t really have much sympathy because this is such a stupid issue to me.

It’s so hard to be unable to do things for yourself but have to wait for someone else to shower because they’d prefer to when you yourself don’t have that luxury.

AITA for wanting my siblings to step up and help me take care of our sick mom?,"My (22F) mom was diagnosed with an early stage of pancreatic cancer two years ago. She went through an aggressive chemotherapy treatment for a year but within 6 months of finishing, the cancer returned so she is back in chemotherapy. 

Me and my mom have always been very close and growing up I was always considered my moms “little helper”. I always helped her around the house, cooking and cleaning and just doing general day to day chores, and when she got sick my role in helping only amplified as she was too weak to do much of anything. I have an older brother and sister, both 30, who have never really helped around the house. Even as kids. They never cooked or cleaned and my mom never pressed them to help because it was just easier for her to have me do it because I never put up a fight(being the youngest and a people pleaser). So this became the routine, my mom has even admitted that she feels I am the only one she can rely on for help.  But recently it’s becoming harder for me to keep up with all these tasks on my own. I have a job, and I’m trying to figure out what I want to do with the rest of my life and I’m also trying to build a long term relationship with my boyfriend. My job has me working long hours outside all day and I’m very tired when I come home and sometimes I just need a break, but I feel I have no one to rely on to help me. Everything I can’t do falls back onto my mom and I feel horrible when that happens because I’m trying my best to take as much stress off of her as possible.  

My older brother still lives at home, his job is less strenuous than mine and he has set hours unlike me, but he doesn’t even do his own laundry or help out with the dishes. It’s like he’s still a teenager. I’ve approached my mom about how this upsets me but all she could tell me is that I expect too much out of my brother and that “men don’t clean”. Her words exactly. AITA for wanting him to take on a larger role? Am I really expecting too much? To be clear, I don’t mind helping my mom in the least bit. I want to give her the most comfortable life she can have, I just need help sometimes. I know they still view me as the youngest and the “helper” but I’m becoming an adult now and still trying to figure out my future, but I’m so scared of trying to branch out because I know my mom will suffer. My boyfriend has also expressed an interest in moving out together in the near future, WIBTA if I move out, knowing how my siblings are?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not apologizing to my friend?,"A while back I had a fight with one of my friend and basically split a friend group that was formed for 3-4 years. Me and this dude fought since we we're little kids (for reference ill call him Mark). We never saw eye to eye but ever since we started being friends again this group formed up. We fought a couple of times over these 4 years and it mostly ended up with me apologizing even tho sometimes it was his fault. For the last 3 weeks the group is no longer a group, we've separated ourselves into 2 different discord servers. 

Everything went south when he started doing anything he can to annoy me. Example: Me and another 3 friends including Mark were on my server when one of them started beating up on me for my weight( when i was a child i had a bit of weight and i always got shit for it, also this was his only remark). When I started saying how i notice him only eating mashed potatos and meat for a while when we were on vaccation, Mark started giving me shit for saying that when the other dude was the one who started. This is only one ex in a hundread.

The beef was between me and Mark but for a week or so all my other friend went to stay on his server. One of them whom was very close to me told me that he started talking shit about me behind my back, telling them lies and stuff like that. A week later he was banned because he was spending time with me instead of them. This happened with another 2 people one of them being threatend to be beat up bc of it.

 After a while one of my close friends told me we should join up a voice chat and talk it out. I said no and that i didn't want to have anything else to do with Mark. He started telling me that I should apologize so everything can go back to normal. I said no to that also mentioning how over the past 4 years i was to one to apologize over shit that was his fault and not mine. He's big ego and selfish-ness came from us trying to be good friends to him. I did everything I could to try not to anger him (he has severe anger issues) but whenever he would get the chance he would walk all over me like i was dirt in his eyes.   


Now apparently everything is my fault in everyone else who sticks by him bc i should've apologized for ruining our friend group.

AITA For Being Upset That My Half Brother Arranged A Surprise Visit/First Time Meeting When I Told Him How Much I HATE Surprises?,"I (40f) have a half-brother (Mike 42m) who I share a father with (whom neither of us has ever met) I only found out about just under 4 months ago. He found me through the AncestryDNA program and reached out. I have always been open to learning more about that side of my family, so I was thrilled when I got his email and we started talking on the phone and over text regularly. However, he drinks A LOT, and he says really off putting things when we talk while he’s drunk, which seems to be everyday. For example: he once called me “fucking hot” in one of our phone conversations while he was drunk, and another time he took the uninvited liberty of disagreeing with an important mental health decision I made for my child. Anyway, I have told him on numerous occasions that I don’t just dislike surprises, I HATE them. I see telling him, and anyone else I’m close to, as setting a clearly defined boundary. A couple of months ago we planned on him making a visit here for us to meet in person for the first time, which he told me he needed to cancel a few weeks later. We had planned initially to get matching sibling tattoos while he was here, and when he told me he needed to cancel for work I kept the appointment time with the artist and then planned to get anniversary tattoos with my husband that we had been planning for the last 3 or 4 years. I found out from someone who heard from my husband that Mike in fact had NOT canceled his flights and was planning to surprise me. The plan was that he would fly into town in the morning and my husband was to take me to the tattoo shop to look at the design for our anniversary tattoos but would actually be getting tattooed with Mike and the sibling tattoo design. I found this out Sunday, and he was scheduled to arrive 4 days later on Thursday. I was LIVID. 1. I made it clear on several occasions that it’s not a good idea to surprise me, 2. He took the liberty of calling my BOSS to arrange my use of PTO for 4 days (like, all of my saved PTO) 3. He took the liberty of deciding what would be permanently tattooed on MY body and when. 4. His plan was to stay in my house the entire time he was here. I waited a couple of days to cool down before I confronted Mike and he got super defensive, and then started gaslighting me saying that clearly everything is all about me, and he was upset about me not being grateful for all of the work he put into surprising me, and that I should have been happy about it. After that conversation he told me have a nice life and Unfriended/unfollowed me on all social media platforms and , as far as I know, canceled the trip.

AITAH for not taking my sister to tutoring?,"I usually take my sister to math tutoring on Wednesdays (today) and Thursdays. My mom pays for it, but shes at work, and I don't mind taking her. 

Anyways, for the past couple weeks I have been struggling with my \*bowel movements\*. And today I felt sickish and felt so much discomfort that I decided to go to urgent care for really bad constipation. They told me that I might have a fecal impaction (sorry for TMI) and they sent me to the emergency room. It was quite awful and they did quite an invasive assessment on me. It was so bad that It hurt to sit down. 

Because I was in the ER, I wasn't able to take my sister to tutoring. Once all this was over we got home and later in the evening my mom asked me if I took my sister to her math tutoring. I hesitated and she threatened to check her online attendance so I told her the truth. I told her I didn't feel good and was unable to take her to her tutoring. Before I could elaborate more she went off screaming. My mom went off screaming saying I was such a waste and that I was a liar and lazy. She called my sister to confront her on why she didn't go. She told my sister she was a waste of money and that my mom would take away her kitten from her. My mom said that she would take the kitten to the pound when shes not watching her and that this is what we get.

My sister, by the way- difficult at times, but cares for me when I'm sick. Made dinner and cleaned up the house all by herself while I was in my agony. She recently saved a kitten off the streets and loves it so dearly. 

I feel awful. I told my sister that I would do whatever I can to keep an eye on the kitten and care for it especially because I am responsible for this.

WIBTA for not having my moochy sister as my maid of honor?,"My wedding is set for October of this year. When I first got engaged, my sister blurted out that she was going to be the maid of honor, even though I never asked her, nor even addressed the subject. Throughout the whole wedding process, nobody in my family has offered to help me with anything. Not that they're obligated to, but it would be really nice. Nobody is helping us pay for the wedding, and we've spent years saving up money to have the wedding we wanted. I casually asked my mother if I'd be getting either a bridal shower or bachelorette party, (didn't have an engagement party) and she flat out told me no, that neither her or my sister could afford to do something like that. In my opinion, shouldn't the maid of honor at least do a bridal shower or a bachelorette party? It doesn't have to be anything extravagant, it could've been just me, my sister, and my other 2 bridesmaids out to dinner or to a couple local bars. I'm not looking for a destination getaway or anything. 

I should include a couple details of the family dynamic:
My 21st birthday was last month, on a Monday (bummer) so Fiancée and I just went to a local bar to have a couple drinks, nothing crazy. I asked my mom and sister if they'd like to join, but also asked if it was okay if they paid for their own drinks since we're working with a tight budget paying for the wedding and everything. They said it was no problem and met us at the bar. We had a good time, but when the check came, suddenly neither of them had any cash to put towards the bill. Not wanting to cause a scene, Fiancée reluctantly paid the whole thing. Then, my sister begged to come over to our place, and we said fine. As soon as she got in the door, she went into the kitchen, and opened up the brand new bottle of alcohol I had sitting on the counter, which was the first bottle of alcohol I bought since I was officially legal, and she poured herself the first drink from the bottle. I didn't realize it until a little later, and the next day I saw that she ate 1/4 of my birthday cake. And she's always like this. Anytime we go anywhere, she CONVENIENTLY doesn't have any money to chip in. Any time she comes to our house, she raids the fridge and helps herself to the alcohol. She's not rich, but she definitely makes enough money to support herself, so I see no reason why she acts like this other than the fact that she's SUPER entitled. 

Big point here is I don't really want her as my maid of honor, but I can't see picking somebody else without it stirring up a bunch of drama. My mom thinks I should just let her to avoid conflict. But why should I give her a title that she doesn't deserve? Fiancée agrees that she takes advantage of us and hasn't helped with the wedding at all, so why should we honor her in our wedding?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not showing up the the movie plan that my friend paid for and rescheduled especially for me?,"Names and details have been changed a little bit. Also, I apologise if the formatting is weird. Currently typing on my phone :)

Hi, so this happened when the Black Widow movie came out. A couple of my friends started talking about going to go watch Black Widow in theatres (there are no covid restrictions in my city) for one friend’s birthday. Let’s call her Ella. 

Now Ella works at the cinema so she gets tickets relatively cheap, and had bought tickets for all of us (it was a decent time before the movie had released, so she asked us to clear out our schedules if possible). However, the date worked for everyone (9-10 people) except for me as I already had plans. At which point, they offered to go out with me some other time, which was totally fine. This caused me to put the group chat on mute, as the notifications were getting too much, and of course none of the information being talked about was in relation to me. 

A few days later, I opened the group chat to clear the chat notifications, and quickly skim read down to the bottom of the messages. But due to the overwhelming amount of messages I missed a lot. 

Cue to a couple days after they were supposedly meant to go and watch the movie, I woke up to about 50+ texts, 30+ missed calls from all the people in the group. I was unwell and my phone happened to be on silent, so I slept through all that.
Apparently Ella felt bad that I couldn’t make it on planned date, and bought a whole another set of tickets on a date they knew I would be home. Since they wanted to watch the movie with me, the first set of tickets went to waste. She did give a couple of them out to her cousins, but still, she had paid for them and then the second set too.
She talked about this in the groupchat, but I must’ve scrolled past it without realising. She saw that I had seen the chats, and assumed that I must be aware and available, as I would’ve said something otherwise. Even though the tickets are cheaper for her as an employee, this entire thing easily cost her up to $120-130.

When I didn’t show up in time for the movie and didn’t reply to any of their texts, she got understandably upset. All of them are giving me an icy shoulder atm, and it’s been quite upsetting. 

While I feel terrible and apologised, I feel that they should’ve just texted me separately to confirm the plan, or Atleast just waited me to actually text and say it was all good before paying for a whole set of new tickets?
When I told her this, she said that I was deflecting the blame and that I disrespected her, and dismayed her efforts to include me. I know that I should’ve gone through the texts properly, but again, doesn’t everyone just skim read large amounts of texts? 

I have offered to pay for the tickets she bought for me, but she says it’s less about the money than it is about my actions. I’m upset that they’re not even trying to see things from my perspective.

AITA for wanting to get a tattoo?,"
I have always tried to be a good daughter. You could have even called me the ‘daddy’s girl’. I have always wanted to get a tattoo and I have expressed that feeling multiple times. I know my father does not agree with them. He thinks getting a tattoo will lessen my chances of getting into Nursing school and becoming a nurse, yet so many nurses have tattoos! 

During dinner tonight I brought it up because I was excited, I have been wanting to get a tattoo with my mom for years. She’s been more excited than me ever since I confirmed two spots for us. But when my dad heard it he got pissed off, and told me I shouldn’t do it and began to blame my mom for peer pressuring me into getting one. Which isn’t the case one bit. Hence I have been saving tattoo inspo. on my Pinterest for years. I yelled at him saying “I wasn’t going to go hell if I get a tattoo.” which ended with the silent treatment and now a tension filled household. I really want a tattoo, and I am going to get one no matter what. Am I the asshole for wanting to get a tattoo against my fathers wishes?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my mother to stop trying to scam me?,"My mom (42) is in an MLM and has made that pretty much her whole life, second only to her religion.

She's invested in a pyramid scheme company called 'Asea'. Their main product is this 'super-drink' that's supposed to help whatever ails you. Muscle pain? Gone. Heartburn? Extinguished. *Cancer? Shrunk.* (There's actual testimonies on the cancer part. No alluding to any other chemo or anything. Didn't say it sped it up, just that it was the sole healer. Just wtf.)There's only three ingredients: Water, Chloride, and Salt. It tastes like literal pool water. I call it God-In-A-Bottle.

I know, don't knock it until you try it, so at my mother's request, I gave it a try, twice. For a month each, I took the instructions word by word daily and.. nothing. Not a single change.

**So onto the conflict:**

My mother has fed into ***EVERYTHING*** they've told her. She's obsessed, it's fucking insane. She buys their drinks, their lotions, their powders, attends classes, goes to conferences, local area groups, has bumper stickers, business cards, she even donated a large amount to put up a *fucking billboard* in our small country town.

I wouldn't care if she kept me out of it, but it's every other day with her. If I say I'm a bit sore from the gym, she hands me a bottle of cream. Headache? Drink. Tired? Drink. Rash? Cream. I once broke out into hives all over my body due to an allergy. Her solution? *Just slap some cream on it!*It's like she's completely forgotten conventional medicine exists! She's basically one of those \~essential oils only\~ moms.

**My breaking point:**

Today, I came home to an ASEA labeled package with my name on it. Whatever, she does this all the time, buys me drinks but ends up drinking them herself. Not today. Nonono, it was a lot heavier than normal. I came in with the box (because I knew she would've yelled at me if I didn't) and she made me open it. She was excited, like I was a 5 year old opening the Christmas gift she got me. Well, guess what was inside..

*A fucking starter kit* for *new sellers*

I flipped my lid as soon as I saw it. I slid it towards her and started shouting about how I don't want to sell her miracle juice and how she needs to stop trying to push her scam onto me. I want nothing to do with that company and I've made it clear many times before. I just don't care. I don't care what she does with it. If she wants to waste her money and time, go ahead.

She started crying as I left, taking a drive. It was understandable, I had never shouted at her like that, but I just snapped. I had clearly expressed my complete disinterest in ASEA many many times and she's blatantly ignored that many times. I understand she wants to include me in her hobbies/""job"", but the way she's going on about it is, in my eyes, toxic.

As I said, I had never snapped like that and, in turn, I'd never seen her cry like that, not because of me. As a result, I feel terrible, but I'm still upset and need some outside perspective.. AITA?

try and control it. Everything they've done is completely useless. All they have done was spray the kitchen cabinets twice a month. It has gotten worse and worse since then.

It caused me to be anorexic and just very body conscious. After I turned 18, I moved out and basically ghosted her.

I tried to change the subject multiple times and trying to comfort her. After she left she sent me a message saying that “Because of you I don’t have anyone to lean on” and that I’m “Too busy with my bf” those weren’t her exact words because she’s not good with English but I told her that I tried to help and be nice but to stop trying to make me the bad guy.

AITA: Ripped up SIL character sheet in a boardgame and refusing to make her a new one.,"Every weekend, my fiance (F) and his siblings have a game night playing different boardgames. Recently I bought a game that everyone has been loving, we have been playing it every time for over 2 month. Everyone gets to choose a character with different stats and the game has multiple different campaigns which is totally random. You never know what campaign you will get. There is one problem, F's brothers wife (SIL) is extremely competitive when it comes to any kind of game, which is really unnecessary especially during this particular board game. She becomes incredibly rude, loud and aggressive while in game, but when she dies she goes into a ridiculous huff and starts bitching about the game or whoever is involved (9 out of 10 times I'm usually her target regardless). I usually don't say much because it is just a game but her antics have started to bother me. We have all said for her to calm down but nothing has changed.


Recently, just to change the game up a bit, I made characters for everyone based on everyones respected NFL teams. Drawing characters that are referencing their teams and their stats on their teams passing yards. Nothing insulting, just a bit of fun. Everyone loves their characters and thanked me, except SIL (liked her sheet but just said ""cool"" to it, okay no big deal). After setting up we started playing the game but as per the course, SIL started getting competitive again. She started the usual, getting way too involved in the game until the campaign started when she died almost immediately because she didn't follow the team strategy. Yet again, SIL started sighing and bitching that she died, this time targeting me and the character I made her.

She said the character was flawed, worse than the characters you get in the game and overall just sucked. After listening for a while, I got fed up and asked her if she hated the character that much which she said she did, so I asked to get the sheet back. She handed me her character sheet and I thanked her while ripping it up. SIL went crazy and demanded to know why I would do that as that was her character. I repeated back to her everything she said and she started demanding I make her a new one as everyone else had one. I told her no, if she didn't like the character and thought the originals were better then she can play them. SIL left with her husband and they both said what I did was a dick move as it was her property. Thing is, it isn't hers. I made it for her to play in game and that is it. But still, everyone thinks I took it too far.

F says that he understands where I'm coming from but I shouldn't have done that and agrees with everyone else. I disagree, it is my property and if she doesn't like it as much as she said then there is no reason for it to still be playable. After all the shit she has said to me, I could have done a lot worse.

We get the biggest storm I've ever seen before in my 30 yrs of living. Sidenote, our son is afraid of storms. I went to check on him, and he was visibly upset. I calmed him down and asked if he wanted to read a couple pages of the hobbit. He obliged, so I read. I left the room and went to the garage where his dad was and mentioned he was upset and I read to him. My fiance said the worst thing I could have done was read to him since it went against what he said earlier.
I mentioned that it had been over 3 hours, and he had been asleep, I highly doubted he would wake up just to spite him and that he was upset. My fiance said he played me and got his way and I don't agree. I don't think reading to any kid at any time is bad, Aita here? Thanks in advance regardless of answer.

My sister and I are both adults struggling to date and etc… my parents want us to stay at home until we are married. I live in a room that’s is 8x6ft. I have a bed and a tv on the wall and a small dresser and no closet. For 2 years I tried to make this space work but it’s quickly becoming too small for me. I would like to contribute as much of my savings as possible to finish the basement so that me an my sister can have an apartment for ourselves and my mother can have an office (my room) and my sister’s bedroom. Part of my plan to remodel the basement is to move the washer and dryer and build a wall so that I have privacy and they still have access to the boiler room, washer/dryer etc… I plan to put a refrigerator and get a small stove top. There’s already cabinets there because there was a kitchen there before. The other problem is there is a ton of gym equipment in the basement that does NOT get used. I mean does not get used at all. They want to keep the home gym that hasn’t been used in years and have me cramped in that room until I get married. When I asked if I could have my sister’s room when she moves in 2 months my step father told me no and I said said if I have to live here I will **** ****** and he said then I’d have gotten rid of both of you. He’s told me multiple times I’m not getting the basement because I don’t deserve it. I’m willing to pay electricity and rent already but they won’t take my money. They expect me to help by cooking and cleaning. I already don’t use the lights in the house and I haven’t actually used my Xbox in months. They are not happy I’ve been going out most of the day and are okay with me having a dresser in my room instead of my bed and sleeping on the couch. I haven’t been able to sleep in my bed for 3 months because I gave up there’s nothing I can do to make the space work. I sometimes get drunk and sleep over at a friends house and I’m ashamed of that but I feel more like an intruder in my mothers house. When I talk about movie out we get into big fights. I feel like I don’t deserve a home. I get told I’m a spoiled brat and I should be happy I have a roof over my head. I keep the house as clean as possible and I try not to be around. I snuck a dog into the house and I’m thankful they let me keep her but even though I take care of her (pay her bills, walk her, train her) I can’t have full ownership. Honestly they could throw all my stuff away and I wouldn’t care. Sometimes I feel like doing that myself. They do pay part of my tuition but up until this point I’ve been taking out loans and paying them off. They’ve made me feel incapable of having a real career and told me I’d fall flat on my face. I ended up resigning from my job cause they told me I didn’t have to worry about money for school to just focus on that but have been limiting my use of the car. I feel trapped. AITA?

Edit: the first floor is being used by my step aunt. She has her own apartment and lives entirely alone (not relevant though). I do think they deserve their own space. But when I do the math that makes moving out worth it, I’d be living paycheck to paycheck, wouldn’t have insurance, or a phone.

Because I know they hired a lawyer and I figured it was for evidence I sent them the screenshot. Then saw it was part of their story on ig talking about how they’re being harassed. My name and part of the convo was blurred out. I feel like they should have never posted that screenshot because I don’t want to get in the middle. I don’t want ppl to know my business.

And I responded to the person who sent me the message making it clear I was cool with that person and didn’t have an issue knowing full well they might repeat what I said. And my friend did blur out my name and what I said back to the person which I appreciate. I just don’t see why they had to share and tell ppl cause we all know they’re being defamed. And by we all, I mean me and my friend. I just don’t see why they feel the need to put this out there and involve me when it’s not my business even though they’re my friend and the other person is not my friend.",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to inconvinience myself over somebody else's problem?,"Recently I moved in to a new flat with my friend. We've looked into renting a flat specifically with a balcony, cause we are both smokers. To be honest, I'd probably be okay smoking in my room, since I roll my own cigarettes (MacBaren Choice, if anyone's interested) that don't have any horrid smell, but usually landlords (ours including) forbid this, and I don't wanna risk it. The flat is on a second flood out of 4, that's gonna be important (tho I guess just in a way that it's not the last floor).

For two months everything was good and dandy, but yesterday I've had my first encounter with our upstairs neighbor. I went for a smoke after coming home from work (~ 2 am) and as I'm standing on my balcony and enjoying my last ciggie of the day, I hear someone going ""Good evening. Can you not smoke on your balcony?"". I look above me, a little bit confused and see someone sticking his head out of the window. ""Evening. And why should I not do it?"" 

The neighbor then started a rant about how the smoke goes up and into his apartment, woke him up, how he's been patient for a while, but now can't take it anymore, how he has a right to a healthy life and doesn't want my filthy habits to impact it, and so on. He then suggests that I should smoke in a kitchen or go completely outside, cause he doesn't like the smell. 

""So you're saying I can't smoke in my apartment on the balcony, because you don't like it? You mentioned you have a right to a healthy life, don't I have a right to do with mine whatever I want? I didn't come to your home and start smoking after all, can't you just close your window and move on?"" To which he replied ""But it's hot outside! I don't wanna close my window. ""

Now at this point, I'm not confused anymore, just startled from his sheer audacity. ""So let me get this straight, you don't like me smoking here, at my place, but you don't wanna inconvinience yourself by closing the window. Instead, you want _me_ to do something differently, even tho it's you who has a problem with how things are, that about right?"" 

""Yes""

""Well okay then,"" I replied and lighted another roll-up, ignoring his following threats to pour cold water on me whenever I'm smoking. Since by the time I finished he was still going on about pouring water, I simply said ""Yeah, you do that"" and headed inside. 

So I guess the question is, am I the asshole here, or is he just an entitled jerk after all? 

TL;DR: upstairs neighbor doesn't like the smoke from roll-ups coming his way when I'm smoking at my place on the balcony; instead of closing the window himself, asks me to go someplace else; AITA for not complying?",Asshole
WIBTA if I tell my parents to not bring my depressed brother to my island?,"I(18M) live with my family in the capital city to study. And I share a room with my big brother(20M) who currently does nothing. I want to move to my island for about three months to get a peace of mind and study there as it takes a lot for me to concentrate. I find it hard to concentrate around people. My brother has severe depression and gets overwhelmed easily hence why he don't go to a job yet. So my parents and uncle thought it would be nice to bring him with me to the island. I want a room all to myself to study and if my brother comes along I don't think I will have my own space. So WIBTA if I tell my parents I don't want him there?

AITA for using my friend’s shower?,"Some context here, I (19F) did not have a place to live for a couple of months so my friend (20F) let me stay with her for a bit.  I moved into my own place a couple weeks ago with a random roommate I found posted online. I don’t know them at all really and it makes me uncomfortable being at home around them. I especially hate the shower in this apartment, it’s really disgusting and the water pressure sucks and it’s always either way too hot or way too cold. I want to move out of here ASAP. 

My friend that I had been staying with went out of town for a few days, and hadn’t gotten the key to her apartment from me. I like her shower a lot better and I knew nobody would be there so I wouldn’t feel weird. I figured I stayed there for 2 months before anyways and I have a key, it shouldn’t be a big deal if I use her shower. 

Fast forward to today, she got back home and noticed things had been moved around in the bathroom and there was an extra dirty towel. She asked me if I had been over and I said yes I used your shower and she got really mad and said she was coming right away to get her key and said I’m a shitty friend for not asking her first. I said if she didn’t want me over she should have took my key away and she got even more mad and said she forgot and that she shouldn’t have to worry about her friend “breaking and entering” and I told her she’s dramatic for saying I broke in when I had a key. 

Now she won’t talk to me. AITA?",Asshole
AITA Am I an ass for wanting the same opportunity as my sister?,"My parents started giving my sister $50 a month (25 each) a month in return for her vacuuming, dusting and doing dishes once a week (on top of the normal chores). She did it for a few months and the stopped for about 3. And during this 3 months, my mom stopped giving her money but my dad continued even though she wasn’t doing any chores. Just a few days ago he stopped.

Well anyway, recently I’ve been asking if I can take over her role. The considered it and said yes. But wait… suddenly my sister wants to do it again.

So we all sit down and have a meeting about it. My dad said he’d pay my sister $25 a month and my mom would pay me $25 a month. This is for the same amount of work she did for $50.

I don’t agree with this because I wanted the same opportunity as her after she chose to stop even though my mom reminded her over and over. And I really want this thing that costs $150 so that would’ve taken me 3 months to earn but now it will take 6 months.

And another thing is, if you’re at a real job and don’t do the work, you get sacked. So I would take her place.

I just find it a bit unfair, and there’s probably many details I missed out so feel free to ask and questions.

What do you think?

WIBTA if I don't play keyboard at my mom's church?,"(Context: I'm a Brazilian student, and here we have vacation in the entire months of January, July and December. And also sorry if this post haves grammar errors)
My history is happening right now, and my case is:
Recently mid-year vacation has begun (the July vacation). And I'm classical composer, youtuber (I have a cover channel and I want to publish my autoral songs there too) and a keyboardist wanting to be a classical pianist. I planned for this vacation that I would use this time to focus on my youtube channel and I would compose some songs, cause my youtube channel is very inactive and I never published an autoral song, and I uninstalled all of the social networks that I spend a lot of time with for it. I explained to my family that I uninstalled these social networks, so any message that they would send send to me, I wouldn't receive, and I also explained them why I did it, and they were very comprehensive then. But last month (June), my mom published a video on her Facebook of me playing and her singing a gospel song, cause I promised her some years ago. And people from her church, including the church pastor and people who organize its special events, put me to play keyboard at one of these special events, but the thing is: my mom also makes part of the equip who organize these church's events, so she could say ""he's trying to focus on his youtube channel so he can't play this month"", but she didn't, and asked me ""can you?"" And I said ""I didn't told you I'm trying to focus on my youtube channel?"" ""Yes, I know it, but can you?"" ""Umm... Ok"". I was a little disappointed with her but because I respect her, I accepted. And here's the point, I didn't knew it would take almost my whole vacation, and I also didn't knew it would stress me a lot (like, a lot of headaches and anxiety crisis), and I didn't knew they would make me play at other events that they would plan, and if I have to fight it every single time that I'll play at this church, I don't want it. And now I'm trying to tell her what's happening, and trying to explain her why I don't want to play at other events, but she doesn't listen to me, and she doesn't seems like she wants to understand me too, and she thinks I'm saying it cause I don't to serve God, and she also says that yes, I'll play at the other church's events, cause if don't, I'm a reason of emberassment for her. She also says ""you work with your channel later"" but I don't know when I'll have time to work with this again.

Well, am I the asshole for don't wanting to play at her church and also for becoming a reason of emberassment for her, or she's the asshole for ignoring me and for forcing me to play at her church?

"AITA for ""holding my work hostage."""," I've worked for a lab for almost five years now. I've gone from a part time worker to a full-time worker. I was hired on to lead studies, do data entry, train people, and manage data. Early on my boss had me do some simple application design which I did in PowerPoint. Our programmer denied a lot of my ideas, which frustrated me to the point I just started to learn programming on my own. I've spent roughly 1.5 years teaching myself various programming languages on my own time. Once I became comfortable, I did some custom programming to make my job easier. I mostly just did some linear regression analysis in python and moving files around.

I learned full stack web development. I made a rough version of our desired website over the course of a few weekends and showed it off. I wasn't using the right web stack. I then learned the new web stack, reimplemented it over another few weekends, and showed if off again. They agreed to let me start working on the website for them. 

While I learned programming, I was still expected to do my full-time job. I repeatedly let them know that the only time I had to do programming was outside of work. I told them I was having a hard time managing both programming and my normal duties. I was getting very burnt out from working an extra 2-4 hours a day and from my classes I took on weekends

Last week I had my performance review where my boss told me that he still wanted me to do both web development and my normal duties. He informed me that he believed it was just a time management issue and we could move some of my duties off my plate. However, a solution could not be found during my performance review as to what duties could be removed nor who they could be given to. We have recently lost a few employees and finding new hires has been difficult.

At the end of my review, I asked for a raise as I was now expected to do web development for them. Once I asked for money for the additional work I was doing, he started questioning my credentials. Whether or not I had a computer science degree (he knows I do not) and which certificates I had. These questions were not raised when he had asked me to do the web developing for him. They never directly said no to my request, however, the questioning of me and the general reaction felt like a no.

As they never said yes to my request for a raise and they started to grill me with questions about my qualifications, I sent out an email stating that I would not be doing web development for my lab. I stated that they saw my web development as valuable, but not enough to give me a raise to do it. They called me in the next day to inform me that I was being highly unprofessional, and I was holding my work hostage from them.

AITA For not buying the camera?,"A few weeks back i was drinking with a friend (40) and they told me that they want to help their kid (18) get into Youtube/streaming to help him beat his depression. The thing is that they dont have much money and i adore their kid, so I offered to help. I couldn't even remember saying this after the fact (due to the drink), but its no big deal, i love this kid, so once they reminded me, it started to come back to me and i was like ""oh yeah, sorry, i forgot! my bad."".

Anyway, the parent wants him to do a fitness thing with their PT friend who wants to do a zero to hero thing (kid is totally onboard with this, because who doesnt want to be 18 and ripped?) and the kid is interested in streaming games.

So i started to look around online and identified the key bits of kit they would need to start a channel. Mic, phone tripod, lights etc. and priced a custom starter kit at a few hundred. Fine, no biggie.

Anyway, my friend then asks about camera, and i said ""he can just use his phone to start on"". They started telling me i was going back on what i had said and that my word is BS. They then linked me to a camera they thought was suitable. I checked out the camera they advised, not too pricey (another hundred), but several things really annoyed me here; 1. his smart phone camera is substantially better anyway, 2. unnecessary e-waste, 3. its my money to give and i never specified what i would buy the kid and 4. I did the research as i said i would, so why are they getting involved in the parts?

They argued that the phone is their kids birthday present and it shouldnt be required to be used for their personal stuff and they shouldn't have to relinquish their phone to get the film/data off. I explained that i could setup a network share so they can stream/dump videos to that directly.

They told me i was being cheap, have gone back on my word and 100 is nothing to me. We argued over this and ive told them im not paying for the camera, but am still happy to stick to my word and purchase necessary kit for the kid to start content creation,.

To me, this looks open and shut, but i grew up in a simpler time where tech was rarer and money was tight for my family, so i used to stretch every penny; dumpster diving for old parts and pushing every little cpu cycle i could to its limits. The idea of starting a hobby with decent kit before you know if you even like it is out of this world to me, but maybe i am being cheap, but dont recognise it because of my upbringing?

Anyway, AITA and am indeed cheap or is she being greedy?

"AITA for going off on my sister for saying her bio kids are ""our kids""","So, my oldest sister has 5 kids by 5 different men. Her first child was abandoned to my mother shortly after birth. Her second child was attempted to be given to a coworker at 9 months old. (Attempted, as in the coworker offered to babysit the kid but was surprised when she got baby's diaper bag with BC, SS card, and a note saying ""you keep the little bitch, I dont want her"") social services ended up getting involved and my mother got her as well. <next 2 children are with both of their wonderful dads, and 5th is currently with her after the dad kicked them both out>

From the entire time my mom had the kids, my sister never once visited or (specifically) called about them. (She'd call sharing some news then as an after thought she would ask about the 1st kid, but never the 2nd, before she hung up the phone) My mom died a year ago, and my husband and I offered to take the 2 now teenagers. My sister was all for it. She came around and talked to them for a little bit, filled their heads with stories of how she tried everything she could to be with them and pretty much telling them that she wasnt in their lives because a series of unfortunate events.

So we have the kids now for a year.  During this time, my sister has made efforts to ask about them, she has bought them gifts, and she occasionally skyped with them. I will mention though that I allowed their relationship to grow as long as all 3 parties were ok with it. At first I would set up awkward skype calls where they all tried to get to know each other, once a week. After a couple months, I told everyone that I wont be setting it up anymore, that they are free to talk to each other whenever they'd like, without feeling pressured. After that, things kind of just went cold. The kids said they just dont feel comfortable with it.

The last factor to take in consideration is this: when my husband and I were filing paperwork, my sister looked over the form and said she agrees to everything on the form (us being responsible for insurance, us having physical and legal custody) except the part where she has to pay child support. She said she was in arrears for never paying child support for her kids and she wouldnt be able to get a drivers license if she had to owe even more. So she wouldnt sign until we agreed to not ask for child support.

One thing that has been bothering me when I text my sister she always asks about ""our kids"" ""how is OUR KIDS doing""  she hasnt been there for these kids for all but the last year of their lives and (edit) refuses to financially support them at all, and she has the nerve to call them ""our kids""? I finally snapped and told her as much.

I later got a text from my other 2 sisters saying that it was uncalled for, that my sister is their BIRTH MOTHER and that she has been trying with the kids lately. Now I'm wondering if I was being an asshole to my sister and should apologize.

ETA: My sister was really upset about it. She said she was the one that gave birth to them and I was just the aunt, she wanted to be nice and say they were both of our kids.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I warned a cousin's boyfriend about my dad's sister?,"Backstory: My cousin's pregnant, and due to a combination of COVID and other circumstances, I have yet to meet her boyfriend. This is shortly about to change. Several members of my family, including my parents, my grandmother and, most important to this, my dad's sister (not his gf's mother), have already met him. I get the feeling that he's a pretty good guy: he's good to my cousin, and ready to step up and support her and their baby, which is really all that matters.

Here's the thing though: while he has stable jobs in his trade, my cousin wants to push him into a role with a government agency, something my dad's sister and her husband can help him with. Therefore, my dad's sister has gotten on board with the pushing. Unfortunately, I know how this show works. While the direct cause of why I no longer speak to my dad's sister is apparent from my other posts, overall it's because she operates on the belief that what she wants for someone is best for them, and if they don't follow her plan for them, they need to be shown how terrible that is. She's not above attempting to ruin relationships because one of the partners was unwilling to follow her plan. When I as a kid and with my mother's backing, refused to do what she believed was right for me (spend a ton of money I didn't have for a private college instead of going to a state school, and then go into a career as a corporate or government drone, which I didn't want to do), she resolved to try to make me look like a terrible person in front of the rest of the family. I should have gone NC then. I didn't out of respect for my dad, and my then living grandfather. When, years later, I refused to follow her instructions to try to get her daughter to talk to me again, she did the same thing. She's done the same to my dad, my mother, and at least two other family members I know of. Still, some members of my family, including the cousin this post is about, still speak to her because if you're not standing up to her, she's very good at ""being in your corner"" (large gifts, constant event invites, etc).

With my cousin's boyfriend being pushed into a closer relationship with my dad's sister, I'm wondering if IWBTA if I was to take him aside, ostensibly as two guys getting to know each other, and give him a warning to watch his back.",Not the A-hole

This morning i woke up with one of those stomach aches. I walk an hour to school and i knew that i could not do that walk because of the pain. I asked my mum for a lift to school and she said no, no reason she just didnt want to. She never drives me to school so i wasnt exactly suprised by this, but i asked her if i could just sit for 15 or so minutes and then leave, so hopefully my stomach ache would hurt less or fade or something by then so i could walk.

She said no, that school starts at 845 and i either arrive on time or i am too ill to go to school. Today is my last thursday before the summer holiday so i wanted to go to school. I told her i thought she was being infair, and school would appreciate me being there even it it was 20 minutes late. I am never late to school so one day hardly makes a difference.

WIBTA- Holding my father to the threat to not be apart of my wedding,"My(28F) fiancé E(30M) was willing to sell his BMW to my half-brother(18M) at market price because he said he really wanted it. E was not looking to sell it and had just had major work done. For context E has three cars- they are all nice sports cars. E agreed to the down payment amount and was fine accepting payments for the rest at a rate my brother could afford. He also knew the fuel pump would need to be replaced and agreed to cover that when the time came. 

After taking possession of the car my dad looked up KBB and thought the price was too high. Instead of calling E, he called and bitched to me multiple times and said E was a shitty partner for not giving my family a “deal” even though E thought that he was. 

E saw me crying after a phone call with my dad so E called him. Since all the conversations had been between E and my brother and my dad and me this was their first time talking about the car. On the call my dad presented his perspective to E and asked what he would do if it was his kid. E responded that he would have been more involved from the beginning. My dad didn’t let E talk after that and said he was selfish and untrustworthy- said he couldn’t trust him to take care of his family or me. Given the drama E agreed to take the care back and went to pick it up immediately. He returned the deposit and paid for brother for washing it and changing the oil. This was about 4 days after he had delivered the car. 

E and I are planning a wedding after 7 years together and 6 living together. After this call my dad thought E owed him an apology and vise versa. I sided with E since my dad is the one that was hurtful IMO and seeing malice where there was none. When I spoke to him he unpromptedly said he was fine not being a part of my wedding if E wasn’t going to apologize. I believe this was manipulative and plan to hold him to it even though it’s really hard for me to picture the day without him and I know this won’t be easily undone. We are currently LC.

He doesn’t think I see E clearly even though he has never made an effort to get to know E. For context E and I both make good money so he thinks we could have afforded and should have given my younger brother a better than market deal. E believes he puts a lot of time and energy into maintaining his cars and he has no need to sell it, so why would he sell it for less than what it is worth. E is a homebody and so is my dad so they both point to the other for why they don’t have a relationship. I often go to family events alone which I prefer over forcing E to give up limited free time doing something I enjoy that he doesn’t.

He was  mid 20s and we share a love of music and playing the guitar.  One day he brings in his girlfriend, they'd not long started dating, she's about 11/12 older than him but younger than me.  She's ace and they're happy, so things went on like this, I'd see them both talk to them, hang out with him when she wasn't around and play music and guitar when I wasn't busy, helped him write a few songs and we were pretty good friends a bit like a mother son kinda thing.

He asked my thoughts on the matter, I told him that there was nothing wrong with that idea but obviously family planning is between him and his girlfriend.  

The other day I got talking to him again after some silence (I'd left him alone because he was studying and with lockdown etc) so we get talking, his girlfriend is now over 40 and they'd gone to discuss the possibility of having children but have been told it's possible but she's left it late and she's run out of time to get fertility treatment via public assistance.  He is very upset with me as he recalls our conversation and says I should have explained to him that they should get a move on if they want kids and he feels I am part of the reason he's ruined his chance to be a father. 

I told him I understood he's upset but that I felt he's just projecting, he accused me of being patronising and that if I were a true friend I'd have been more honest. I see where he's coming from but something like that is very personal, was it really my place to point out to him that as his girlfriend is so much older than he is that it's possible she may not be able to have children when he wants them? I think he's just angry, the girlfriend has kept really quiet about it and I suspect she doesn't really want kids but is using me as a scapegoat.

AITA for pretending to be a Christian,"So, I'll jump right into it.

My parents were loaning me their car while mine's in the shop. Their car has a sticker on the back window that says 'Jesus Loves'. I'm not a Christian, but it's not my car, so c'est la vie.

Well, I was going to the store with my mother and we just got back into the car when someone knocked on the window. I rolled my window down because I thought I might've dropped something or another. Apparently this elder couple saw it. When I rolled my window down, they started with the usual jargon. ""God is good"", ""Jesus saves"", that kinda stuff.

Now like I said, I'm not a Christian, but I don't want to start arguments about this kinda stuff. My personal ideology is ""You're religious? Good for you. I'm not gonna disrespect that unless you disrespect me or my beliefs first.""

So, I just put on a smile, conversed with them a bit. It was easy since I was raised in a Christian household. Shook their hands (I frequent hand sanitizer and am fully vaxxed) with a 'god bless' and left the parking lot.

Well, my mom started reaming into me. I don't want to go into the whole conversation, but to sum it up, she essentially said ""If I'm not a man of faith, I shouldn't act like one. It's disrespectful to the faith and you're just lying to them.""

I kinda understand where she's coming from, but in my eyes, it didn't hurt anyone, right? I mean, what did she expect me to do? Flip them off, say 'Hail Satan', and speed off? I feel that would've been more disrespectful.

We are both very successful in our careers and make about the same amount of money.  He has an ex-wife, Cara (33), and 2 children Sarah (6F) and Sam (3M). It is relevant to mention that Cara does not make a lot of money and the majority of her income comes from Tyler's child support (she does not receive alimony because of a prenup). I really do love these two little ones and consider them a part of my family.  I am very well aware of the fact that they have a mom and I try to respect her as their parent as much as I can.  We have been fairly successful until very recently.  

I built a new home right before I met Tyler.  I recently installed a pool in the yard (it's very common for people to have pools in my area).  I know that I spent a lot of money on the pool but it was something I wanted. It hasn't been an issue until I received a text from Cara two weeks ago.  

She found out about the pool and because the kids spend time here (we do not live together but they all come over frequently, I even have rooms for each kid) she has decided that she should have some input.  She sent a text of a gate lock that is over $500 and told me before the kids are allowed at my home again, I will need to install this lock.  I ignored her until I saw Tyler the next day and informed him that I believe this lock is ridiculous considering I already have a lock installed on the gate.  Tyler agreed that the new lock was overkill and told Cara that we would not be installing it as it is an insane amount of money and the one currently on the gate functions in the same capacity. I have also offered to pay for swimming lessons for both kids so that we can ensure that they would be comfortable around any body of water.

Cara was not happy and has banned the kids from my house.  We have opted to stay at Tyler's when he has the kids and now the kids are upset that they can't use the pool at my house.  We have not told them that it is their mother causing the issue.  Some of our friends think we are TA because the lock would cost less than a letter from a lawyer telling her to back off and the swimming lessons not to mention the damage to the co-parenting relationship. We think that by giving in to her unreasonable request, we will be setting a precedent where we are always the ones to bow down.  So are we TA for not backing down?",Not the A-hole
AITA for eating my brother's Subway cookies?,"Every Sunday, my grandmother takes us to Subway and my brother and I both get two cookies each. I eat them, but my brother never does. After about a year of this happening, I got fed up and told my brother that he had two days to eat them and that if he failed to eat them, that I would eat them for him. Flash forward to Tuesday, and wouldn't ya know it? Cookies still in the bag. I ate them without hesitance. I was too afraid to tell him because I'm afraid that he will be angry. But at the same time, I warned him that I would eat them for him since he doesn't want them so badly and he said he'd get around to it. Yeah, I ate them and they were stale. Any longer and they would've gone bad. He did notice and he scolded me and I told him that they would've gone bad and that I'd buy him more as long as he ate them soon after. Yeah, but the deed was done. I do feel kinda bad. It was pretty much gluttony. But at the same time, he noticed around the same time they would've been spoiled, so they were bad anyway.

AITA/WIBTA for keeping my septum piercing?,"first of all, english is my second language so i may make mistakes.

a little background: my dad's family is fanatic muslim and my dad was like them long time ago. (my dad always says me that parents don't raise their kids, kids raise their parents) so they don't like things like piercings or tattoos. i always wanted a septum piercing and i got pierced in my first year of collage. my family didn't like that but not because of religious things, they just thought it kinda ruined my 'beauty'. but i was a rebellious one in the whole family and kinda still am, so i don't want to (or can't) hide somethings. when my grandmother saw my piercing, she wanted to me take it off (other ones didn't say something positive or negative). 


so, i'm going to go my hometown (village) on this saturday for a religious holiday (my mother and father are in there and i want to see my family, especially my dad. i haven't seen him since may) and i'm gonna stay there for a week. my mother called me a few hours ago and asked me to take my piercing off, at least during my stay, because my dad (and also other relatives) shouldn't see it and it would be disrespectful. but like---my relationship with my dad is very good and i talk him about everything and he always finds a way to understand and accept me the way i am. i am not a muslim and my father knows this and we always discuss about religion, politics, etc. since i was 12. the others are just, like, i don't give a sh*t. 


and i said somethings in anger to my mom about everyone just should accept me this way and i'm just fed up with this situation and i fought for myself against their things for years and just like i don't interfere with anything, they should do the same.

afterwards my mom's voice sounded very sad and then we hang up. my mom and i don't have a good relationship but i don't want to make her sad and i love her, so i thought maybe it was unnecessary for me to got angry and the things i said were just pointlessly harsh that she got sad.. 

so am i the bad one here? i could just say ""ok mom i'll take it off"" and won't wear it for a week but i didn't. i just suddenly felt restricted and didn't think twice.

AITA for feeling inconvenienced at my brother’s wedding?,"
Jumping right into it, my brother got married in May down in Texas (I’m from NY). The wedding was delayed a year due to COVID. Everything for the wedding was taken care of because it was canceled a week before. 

Last minute a bunch of new requirements come up that the bride and groom have both neglected to inform me about. This causes a significant financial strain on me. One of these being that I had to forfeit my Airbnb to stay at a hotel because SIL wanted us to eat brunch which was gone by the time I got there because she scheduled my makeup at the same time which I also had to pay for (which she didn’t mention).

I lent my brother my charger with the mutual understanding that he’d return it as my flight was at 6am the morning after the wedding. I planned to leave early, got delayed because my parents kept saying “leave after this part” until about 12am then my sister wanted me to take her kids back to the Airbnb so I was getting them together. The main parts of the wedding were over, and I asked my brother to get me my charger as I was leaving. He tells me he left it at the hotel and at that point I was stressed and panicked and anxious. I’m in an unfamiliar location and tired and I need to drive two kids back with a low battery and still manage to get some sleep so I can drive to the airport.

I’m visibly but he says he’ll send it in the mail and what can I do? He says I should just buy another charger and that irks me because of all the unexpected costs that arose. But I leave and while anxious I make the 12 hour journey back. 

My mother calls recently and tells me that my brother didn’t like my attitude and it hurt him because it came from family. And that it messed with the tone of his wedding. They say I should have waited until after the wedding to get the charger. That I should have just sucked it up since it was his big day. My argument is that I did suck it up. I held my patience for the whole weekend, but I’m only human and there’s only so much I can take.

ETA: everyone was aware of my flight time. I couldn’t book a later flight because of the total travel time. I’d have ended up getting back closer to midnight and I had work the next day. I don’t live in the NYC area so I wasn’t flying into those airports (usually nonstop). If I could have booked a later flight I would have. I couldn’t take more time off because I had other important health-related procedures coming up that I needed my time for and I don’t accrue quickly. I had already taken 2 days off for the wedding. This flight was the best I could do given my circumstances.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not paying my sister’s car bill?,"I (16F) have been working for a couple months now. I have amassed a good amount of money in savings for college and other expenses for the future. 

My older sister (29F) asked me for a favor to help pay her car bill. She asked because we went to Koreatown to shop for my other sister’s birthday and she needed some money in case she didn’t complete her car payment. I said okay, thinking she would need $100 or $200. 

Today she came into my bedroom and asked for $585. I was shocked, and I told her that I couldn’t do it. She said that her check hadn’t come in. ( This check is apart of a settlement she gets monthly from a company she had sued. ) I told her that I still couldn’t do it. And she kept guilt tripping me, saying how embarrassing it was that she had to ask her 14 year old sister for money. I’m not 14, and I think it’s more embarrassing that she has no savings or even back up money at all. 

And I understand it’s hard to save money, but she makes good enough money that even just a little bit would be fine. She left in a rage. 

You could ask why I didn’t let her borrow the money just this once, but it comes down to her history with money. 

She doesn’t pay rent. I have another sister who does, and she gets upset when the Sister #1 doesn’t pay because my dad gives her a free pass. 

I don’t pay rent, my parents don’t expect me to but if my dad needs money, I help him out because he’s my dad. My sister on the other hand, is in debt with my other sister, always saying that “put it on my tab” when wanting stuff. We all let her get away with it, and my dad has been struggling because of it. And since the account billed for the car payment is my dad’s, my sister is gonna have to explain to him why it got over drafted.

WIBTA if I made my friend choose his birthday gift?,"So I am 20m and my friend is also 20m. For my friends birthday I found a really cool online store that sells custom made sweaters. I bought two sweaters, one has a design for a TV show that both my friend and I like and the other one is a design for a TV show that only my friend likes. Originally I intended on just keeping the one for the TV show that we both like for myself and giving him the other but I didn’t think that was fair in case he liked the design for the other one more so I decided I was going to show him both and let him pick which one he liked more. 

If he chose the one for the TV show that he liked, I was going to just keep the other. If he chose the one for the TV show we both liked, I was just gunna regift the other to another friend I knew liked that show or maybe try to sell it. I am truthfully fine either way.

I told another friend about my plan and he told me it was kind of a dick move to make somebody choose their own gift, especially if I intended to keep one of them. He said that it’s weird to show somebody two gifts that they’d like but tell them, “You only get one though.” If I do it that way it’ll make it seem like he’s losing out on something he likes no matter what he chooses. He said that I should either just give him the one for the TV show he likes and not even mention the other one or that I should just give him both. 

I didn’t think about it like that until now but it’s starting to make sense.

AITA for not wanting my mother to pray over my medication?,"I (20F) was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder in late 2020. I have tried the mood stabilizer Abilify, but recently started having questionable side affects that were too much to handle, doing more harm than good. I switched to Lamictal this month. My mother (49), who i wouldn’t exactly pin as a devout christian, has been very helpful and a big part of my support system since i was diagnosed previously (around 7th grade) with depression and severe anxiety. It isn’t until recently that she’s been “revamping” her faith. Reading her bible, posting about it on facebook, etc. Yesterday, she took my medication from my backpack without asking and began to pray over it out loud. I make it a goal in my life not to disrespect anyone’s religion, but I myself am agnostic, and have complicated (negative) feelings towards the church/christianity in general. My mother is very aware of my opinion on this matter. I don’t mind my family discussing their faith, although it does make me mildly uncomfortable when i am prayed for. To put it gently, If an all mighty God turned out to be real, I would still not praise it, due to personal reasons. Now, I have been made known that my mother (and other family members) have been praying for me. Although a little uneasy, I figured the least i could do is let them pray- as long as they do it in private. After all, to them, they are seeking out help for me from the highest power they believe in. However, my mother praying out loud and with my medication in the living room almost made me nauseous with discomfort. I politely asked her to continue in private, without my pills. She blew up and said she could do whatever she wanted, and when i resigned to my room and let her pray, she didn’t stop there. She came to my room and criticized me for being disrespectful to her religion. Shouldn’t my stance on the topic of religion matter too, since it’s my medication and my battle? I appreciate and love her, and although she is part of my support system, i can’t help but feeling that she isn’t considering my reality and my feelings.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to watch my sister all the time?,"I (f15) am turning 16 next month and because of this I want to get a job so I can become more independent and pay for my own gas/insurance etc. The problem is that for the past year my parents have been relying on me to watch my sister (f6) everyday. I even had the chance to go back to in-person school around April (which was shot down by my mother because I had to take care of my sister). 

Thankfully my school had the option of staying online which I did, it was really hard juggling a kid and online school but I still managed to keep good grades. I specifically asked my mom if I could go back to school and she told me no because I had to watch my sister. Ever since she has denied ever telling me I couldn't go back to school but today she said, ""Well maybe I did say that but I'm not sure because I was so stressed."" Whenever I tell her I want to get a job after my birthday she says ""We'll see"" like its an unreasonable request. 

She also gets mad and calls me spoiled and selfish because (get this) I don't want a birthday party! I understand that most people probably want a cute sweet 16 birthday party but I have NO FRIENDS. My mom puts so much effort into birthday parties and they truly are special but they always just make me depressed because there's no friends to invite. As of right now my dad (who made the majority of the money) is also switching jobs into something that makes half of what he was making before. With all that monetary stress I just see a party as a waste and I would rather do nothing on my birthday. 

I would of course still watch my sister whenever I didn't have work, I'm not upset about having to watch her. It's just starting to get over the top... whenever I'm at my bfs house (normally on Saturday) she calls me and tells me to get home to watch my sister when my dad is home! That's the one day a week I leave and somehow my sister is still my responsibility. My dad is a little bit of a man child but he still watches his own daughter.

AITA for not seeing my friend today?,"For context here’s everyone’s situations:

Me: (20F) works 12 hour shifts + overtime most of the time

Friend: (21F) living 16 miles away, works in a nursery in the same town I live in, works 8-7 with three hour break in between

Nan: (61F) lives 12 miles away, is a cancer patient, has monthly immunotherapy appts

On with the story. My friend messaged me as I woke up this morning asking if I’d like to pop to her while she’s on her break at work, I tell her I need some time to wake up properly and give me a bit. It’s my first day off where I don’t have to worry about going to work the next day as well, so I think of going to see my Nan.

After this my friend has messaged me saying I can come in to her boss’ place and help her make sweets, I reply asking if she could just pop over to mine (5 mins down the road) and have a cig, cuppa and a chat as I’d like to see my Nan and don’t have much time to be making sweets as I have other things to do.
Friend promptly messaged back saying “can’t you see your Nan later” knowing my Nan’s situation and that she gets very tired later on in the afternoon, I remind friend of this. So I drive over to my Nan’s with my laundry (she insists I bring some with me as I don’t have a washing machine) with the intention of putting a load on and driving back to my home town to see friend. 

I get to my Nan’s and find that my friend has been trying to call me so I apologise and say that I was driving and am at my Nan’s now and that’s when friend gets annoyed saying “oh okay” knowing she’s annoyed I say to her if it’s more convenient as she’s busy if I come tomorrow or the day after as I’m free, but she replies to those with a simple “I’m busy forget it”. So I just message her back saying “okay I’ll find a day where we’re both free and come and see her but from now on I’ll message her to see how she’s doing and I get no reply and I’m fairly sure she’s blocked me.

AITA for how I treated my trainee?,"The company I work for only has 3 people. The boss (65m) myself(22m) and my trainee (19m). We wash windows, clean gutters, pressure wash driveways, etc… I’ve been at the company for roughly 6 months and have been put in the lead position after we had 4 people have started collected a couple paychecks and then bounced. I’ve gotten pretty burnt out on training people and then being left short handed. So incomes my new trainee, let’s call him W. He shows up first day bright eyed and bushy tailed, but something seems off about him… W has worked for a temp agency straight out of highschool doing construction work, most of the time it’s work to hire but he can’t seem to make anything stick and is constantly bouncing from site to site, he wants something more consistent so he found this job and we hired him almost on the spot since it’s been difficult finding anyone. He goes through the general training and seems like he can do the job so he gets put in the van with me. I adjust from working by myself back to training mode. I show him how to start cleaning windows and he’s doing fine. No streaks, no smears and it’s quality work. We dabble in other stuff throughout the week but the majority is windows. We come back from the weekend and I’m feeling confident to let him do his thing and tell him to come find me if he’s struggling with ANYTHING. We go through our days and by Wednesday my boss pulls me aside to ask what’s been going wrong with the work quality. Me being confused I asked “what do you mean? What’s wrong with it?”. Turns out every single window that he’s touched has to be redone and a full day is needed to fix it. A day we don’t make any profit. So we go back to training. I’m walking him through the process and he’s doing fine again. We finish a big all day job and I go back through and double check everything. It’s all ruined. While I’m holding his hand it’s all fine but whenever I walk away it’s garbage quality. Pretty soon it turns into 3 weeks of no improvement and my being patient with him has ran it’s course. I begin to be short tempered, still being careful with my words so I’m not degrading him. But it’s getting more and more out of hand. To the point where he’s caused $800 in damages to windows in one job using a razor blade to scrape the glass (an absolute last resort). I asked wtf he thought he was doing and why he thought it would be a good idea to do that and he had no response. He then tried to lie and say I was like that not knowing I was the one who quoted the job a week prior. I called him out, by this point I was furious because i had to explain to the customer that we damaged their windows at his personal house. (A repeat customer that consistently pays us $1800 every 4 months to come clean his rental houses).

WIBTA if I waited until Saturday to take care of my injured dad?," 

Hi everyone,

I’m really stuck in the middle of this issue and both parties are essentially telling each other to screw off. I think I know what I have to do but I'd like to get outside opinions.

I \[22F\] moved in with my boyfriend \[22M\] in May 2020. We’d been long distance since 2016 and decided it would be a good idea for our relationship. I’ve worked since coming here but recently quit my job in order to focus on my last few classes in school. Our arrangement currently is that I would drive him to work since he only has a permit. He pays me for both time and gas and it works out pretty well. Today he started a new job, a lot closer than his previous one. He has to be there to train today (Thursday) until Saturday afternoon. 

The problem now is with my dad. On Monday, he got into a workplace accident and broke bones in his foot and up to his knee. He had to have surgery and was released last night. My mom called me very upset, her and my brother \[19m\] were having difficulty lifting him and basically said last night was a struggle. They want me to come home and help take care of them, which I fully intend to and want to, but I don’t know if I can make it until Saturday. My boyfriend offered to come with me and help, but I’d still have to drive him until then.

I know I need to go and take care of him, I just also made a promise to someone else. I’m not that far, it’s only about 90 miles (145km) so I can make it there in less than 2 hours. I feel really bad about this and I’m hearing from two parties who are telling me I should do two completely different things.

Thanks

AITA for being friendly at a party and outgoing at a party where I only knew one person.,"I (M29) got invited to a friend's(f25) grad school acceptance celebration/brunch. During the brunch I interacted and had conversation with everyone in the group of about 8 people. I met everyone for the first time that day. We all shared Instagrams to tag one another in brunch photos. The conversations were all entertaining and I had purchased some fun gifts for my friend although I had forgotten them. 
Brunch was fun, but everyone had plans later. So we all agreed, and my friend created a group chat to plan further events together. I gave one of the girls a ride to catch her bus home. 
Later after the weekend I messaged the group. I sent a tik tok that related to a previous conversation from brunch. Later the group was disbanded. Didn't know why. Everyone seemed to have a good time..

I messaged my friend. Simply asking the group chat was deleted? 
She messaged me a paragraph or two about how she was upset, and she felt that I was flirting with all her friends. 
I see the implications of being friendly to the opposite sex at a party. But I was friendly to everyone equally. 
I just let it go as a miscommunication and iterated I didn't recognize it as flirting. Also that I avoid dramatic situations, and as a result I don't date friends, or friends of friends. So I'll just leave it be. Not more to say tbh. I don't feel like it's worth an effort to change someone's impression of you once they've made their mind up.

She messaged in return saying she doesn't believe I wouldn't try to date her friends. And that I saw the entire party as an opportunity to hook up with her friends. 

Atm just letting things be. Not responding to her messages. But I feel like all of a sudden I'm seen as Joey from friends saying 'how you doing?' to every one. 
Im a bit confused and I like being friendly and making friends. I fought a lot during covid to understand and put my childhood introverted tendencies behind me. And being more friendly and kind without expecting anything in return. But I rather be on my own without socializing rather than be accused of being a creep with no ability to recognize boundaries.

AITA- For treating my mum differently?,"Me (18M)

My mum and dad split up when I was 5. They didn't divorce. My mum got a flat and my dad stayed with his brother and sister in-law. Mum had me and my sister from Monday to Friday and my dad had us from Friday to Sunday. It was like this for 5-6 years. My parents got back together and have been this way for 7 years. 

The problem is that I have been treating my mum differently. I had only found out. The reason for this was because she was a bad mother. She fed us two slices of toast every day for dinner (that's why I'm thin till this day). She wouldn't spend any time with us, only in her room smoking and watching TV. We had no connections with family from her side. However, it was different when we were with our dad. We would spend time with him, go places, he would cook and help us with homework. It was more fun. He stayed near family so we saw out cousins regularly Every Friday I would smile when I see him and get upset when I leave on Sunday. 

It's been pointed out by my mum recently that I have shown favoritism towards my dad even to this day. The connection between me and my mum has broken, we don't joke and we argue. Every mistake she makes pisses me off (even small ones). I'm just angry because my dad got it so bad, he only saw us for two whole days. (Evening friday+Sunday Morning=less than a day)

During dinner I commented that I thought I saw hair in the food.. my neighbour went on to say I was stupid and that I knew anything and how could there be any hair in the food. (As someone who worked in the hospitality industry, it's possible). Instead of keeping quiet or defending me, my cousin decided to join in the name calling and it really hurt my feelings. [Haha saying it out loud (or typing it comes off weird).] 

 I got up, paid EVERYONE'S bill and went and sat outside the restaurant for 53 minutes. None of them called, texted, went on sm or even came outside the restaurant. By the 45 minute mark, I called my SO(M34) and explained the situation. I was upset and just wanted to go home, but he kept telling me to stay and wait for them, but my emotions took the best of me. By 1am I was walking by myself 5 city blocks and drove home without any of them. 

It wasn't until I was home (about a 15 mins drive)  that I finally started getting messages from them asking where I was. But only because they were done dinner.

Also, my cousin came back into the city this past weekend and we got into a huge argument. He brought up what had happened. He said he told majority of our family and they are disgusted by what I did and how I should have taken care and looked out for him. It should also be noted that my cousin is a notarious liar and will bend the truth to make himself look better. None of my family has come forward to bring this to my attention and  it seems as though they have blocked me from social media and calling.

AITA: For arguing with a leader of a small community over adding proper credits?,"

Yesterday, yes this happened yesterday, a user in this small community I’m in posted a traced art piece. In the post, they never stated it was traced and didn’t link back to the photos they traced. I know tracing is an important tool in art but I don’t believe traced art pieces should be posted around, and if they are posted shouldn’t credit be given to the photographer of the photo to be traced? 

So I went to the post, dug up the traced photos, and called out the user for it. Admittedly it wasn’t the nicest way to call someone out. It was very blunt. It called them out for tracing with proof, and told them to credit the photographer. (Side note, I did call them out on an alt account. Because I was afraid this would happen..) But before I knew it everyone in the community was coming after me. Saying that it was “heavily referenced” ( two things, one photographer still needs credit, and two its wasn’t, the lines lined up exactly with the photographs.) 

They accused me of art theft because I took a screenshot of the artwork to compare it to the actual photos. ( Just a side note the person I called out was one of the leaders of the community.) anyway it didn't take long for the creator of the small community to show up- arguing with me.

And I just kept telling them that all they needed to do was credit the photographer because I felt like it was wrong not doing so.

AITA for leaving a housing situation without communicating and deep cleaning?,"For context I’ve been living in this house for the entirety of the pandemic. I’ve been deeply depressed and have spent 99% of my time in my room when not at work. Ive been on friendly terms with the roomies but we weren’t friend-friends as I barely saw them. I told the house that I would be moving out in July, but I didn’t know the date. One roommate left for 2 weeks, my opportunity to move came and I deep cleaned my room, packed all my stuff, had the landlord walk through and left without notifying them. 

I left a note on their bed with a little drawing I made of their cat, I should’ve sent them a text but my anxiety stopped me and I do realize that was not great behavior. They then put me on blast in the house group chat with a couple messages (they were respectful but harsh) and said thanks for the card and good luck but that our relationship was irreparably damaged and I had done everyone wrong because I didn’t do a full deep clean of the house. The problem is, deep cleaning the house was never brought up to me or anyone at any point, it was something they were thinking of bringing up when they got back. Im stuck between feeling very guilty and also not seeing what the big deal was and why a public dress-down was necessary. I honestly can’t tell if I am the asshole.",Not the A-hole
AITA For being a messy roommate?,"For context back in last august I moved into a 2 bedroom apartment  with a randomly assigned roommates for school. It was the only plan I  could  afford and I have no family or friends to stay with so I bit the  bullet.  The first week was fine, if a bit frustrating. I found out all  of them  were allergic to cats (Literally all three) and I had a cat as  an emotional support animal.  Then began the arguments over messes. I am  a messy person naturally, but  I also work full time in addition to  full time school. Not to mention  my adhd and depression make it hard  for me to keep up on things outside  of what I view as necessary to  survival. My roommates hated this. They  would constantly report me to  management for the mess. I will admit, it  was bad, especially in the  beginning as I was not medicated at the time.  I ended up incurring  lease violations because of this. I was upset, but  understanding. Then  they moved back home, all three, and blamed it on  my mess. Once again I  understood but I was tired of them being  completely full of vitriol  because of this, and it felt exhausting cause  none of them except one  worked and I was the only one who did school AND work and paid all my  bills by myself.

They  also didn't  respect my wishes for what I wanted, which was just one  thing, to tell  me when people are coming over so I can clean. One of  their moms  yelled at me even saying that wasn't required in the lease  unlike me  cleaning so I shouldn't complain.

The   only reason I feel like I might not the asshole is cause of how they   treated me. I'm reliant on things like food stamps but since they were   not living there they made me pay all the utilities for a 2 bed room   apartment and refused to help at all, putting me into extreme debt I am   still trying to crawl out of. On top of that the whole staff treats me   with contempt here cause of how often my roommates complained and  forced  them to come up here and inspect the apartment. I even had the   apartment manager forced up here for it to yell at me for an hour about   how messy my place was and for having stuff on my roommates half of the   room (It was on a desk that went partially into my roommates side).

Just   today they had the management try to force me to sign papers saying if   there were ANY damages or stuff left behind I would be held full   responsible for the fees. They did this while leaving a bunch of dirty   dishes, appliances, and clothing. I'm crushed and tired and now I just   want to know if I am as responsible if they say I am for all this.",Asshole
AITA for refusing to remove my uncle's GoFundMe at the expense of ostracizing my family?,"I (22F) created a GoFundMe for my uncle (60M) against my mother's (55F) wishes. In 2015, my uncle who lives in Iran was diagnosed with brain cancer and had to have his malign tumor removed. After he had it removed, his motor functioning and speech was significantly impacted, and he had a very difficult time learning how to speak again. He eventually became better, but his health took a toll a few weeks ago when the cavity that replaced the area where the malign tumor started to fill up with fluid. He started to walk very slowly and with a limp. He was taken to a hospital in Iran and was discharged after three days because of the severity of the pandemic in Iran and has spent the rest of the time at home. His condition has rapidly gotten worse, and he is now paralyzed from the waist down and unable to speak. Realizing how dire the situation is, my family is trying to hire an ER nurse and Physical Therapist in Iran to take care of him 15/24 hours out of the day for a few months. However, the cost of inflation is ridiculous due to the sanctions and the prices have gone up astronomically. My family of 8 aunts and uncles are trying to take care of the costs, but it's too expensive. My mother in particular is contributing $1000/month compared to some of my other relatives, who are contributing $200/month. She has already been working herself to the bone trying to put my brother and I through college, and she's injured herself, and I just can't bear myself to see her in this condition. Realizing how dire and grave the situation is, I created a GoFundMe to help crowdfund money to hire an ER nurse and physical therapist. I've already started to gain some traction with the campaign, but we are still very far off. I told my mother today about the campaign and she immediately told me to delete it. She said that since I grew up in a very Persian household where we should never to ask for money, and will be ostracized from other members of the Persian community if we did. I told her I deleted it, but I am still thinking of keeping the fundraising campaign up for a bit. I know if the word gets out about this in our family, they will have a few choice words to say to my mother and I, but my main concern right now is my uncle. So Reddit, AITA?

Edit: I should've elaborated; I have had a full time job all throughout college, but I only make $15/hr. Throughout my college career, I've paid for half of my rent, food, books, car, and school supplies. My mom pays for the other half of my rent and my tuition. My brother is trying to get a job but it's difficult considering he already has an internship at a lab. I’ve agreed to contribute $100 starting next month.

Edit 2: Thanks Reddit for reminding me that I need to get my head out of other people’s business. I still have it up right now but when I wake up in 10 hours, I finalize my decision. I’ve talked to my cousins because you guys helped me realize that I should definitely reconsider this whole thing. However, it’s complicated things more because they think it’s a great idea and have shared with their social circles (excluding the Persian social circles at my request). They also want to help me convince my mother that this is a good idea, but I don’t want to stir the pot more than I have. One of my cousins wants to start her own for my uncle, but I do not want to be associated with it.",Asshole
aita for ruining my sister’s wedding.,"Throwaway account and please don’t repost anywhere else. 

I (24f) was with my ex fiancé N (27) since I was 13 and he was 15. He was my first love, my first everything. We got engaged when I was 20 and about 6 months after we found out we were expecting. Unfortunately I miscarried a couple days later. That was the worst moment of our lives. 

We always dreamed about starting a family early so this was a major blow to us individually and to our relationship. I fell into deep depression and I admit I was wrong for only caring for the lost i felt and not my partner’s. We argued a lot, he partially blamed me and I accused him of not knowing how it felt to lose a life you were growing inside you. 

We were hurting each other and decided to separate for a while, that while turned into a year. We still kept in contact, I went to therapy and worked on healing myself, he even came to a few sessions with me. 

We decided to get back together shortly after my 23rd birthday. However the relationship wasn’t the same. He was somewhat withdrawn from me and I thought it was because he still blamed me. I was sick overthinking and worrying. It got to the point where i was going backwards in my process so i decided to snoop through his phone. I found out during the year we separated he had been confiding in my sister (27) and it turned to something intimate. He cut it off when we got back together but the damage was done. She was pregnant. 

Turns out my parents knew about this and some of our friends. I kicked him out and cut off everybody who knew. Well a couple weeks ago I got an invite to the wedding. Something snapped inside of me, I got drunk and I took a cab to my parents house where they were throwing a party for them. Most of my family was there, I basically showed up and gave a whole fuck you speech to everybody. My sister ran upstairs in tears and my parents called me an a hole for ruining the prospect of their wedding. I said good because nobody apologized to me, everybody just kept saying we were separated, things happen people fall in love, i should be happy for them, the heart wants what i wants. The worst part is my sister told me maybe my baby died for a reason so she could get her happy ending. 

I’m regretting getting drunk now because i’m not a confrontation person but i was so upset. Aita ?

Hi everybody, thanks for all the support and encouraging words so far. I know this update is coming so soon but i’ll like to tell you guys a joke. My sister called from an unknown number a couple minutes after i posted this lol (I’ve blocked everyone). She asked well more demanded that I return the ring fiancé bought since it would be disrespectful to keep anything for him knowing they’re starting a family. She said how immature of me for basically not sucking it up and being happy for her. She even intended to make me her MoH. I apologized to her for ruining her party and told her I’d mail the ring but as for me and her, we’re done and to tell my parents the same. I’m here balling my eyes out waiting on my therapist to finish with another patient so i don’t turn to a bottle again and go off again.",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to drive my sister to her toxic bf’s house?,"
Whew this one is a little bit of a doozy but I’ll keep it short and sweet. 

Basically my (15F) sister’s boyfriend keeps stringing her along. I’m kinda surprised because they started dating during quarantine and they’ve lasted a little over a year despite going to different schools. 

It should be noted that she was going to break up with him a couple of months ago because he was being very rude to her and not treating her right, but ultimately she changed her mind.

Anyways, the other day I found her crying (she literally never cries so this is very abnormal), and she refused to tell me and mom what it was about. She has depression but I’ve never seen anything like this come from her. Eventually she spills that he had basically dumped her for the sake of his mental health. Fine, ok, that’s understandable. The next day she says that it’s actually just a break and they’ll be back together soon.

So flashforward to today, my mom asks why my sister is so secretive with her phone and they get into a huge argument where it comes out that last night at like 1am they decided to start dating again. 

We’re both shocked and she went on this whole spiel about how he’s a great person and they’re good for each other. (I’m leaving  out a lot of details but trust me it was a little intense for what it was).

Keep in mind this is a boy who basically tried to shame her into stopping her depression medication + when he went on vacation they stopped talking and she was the happiest I’d seen her in a while.

Anyways since I’m her main mode of transportation to his house, I told her that I thought he was toxic to her and that I refused to drive her to his house anymore. She got upset and stormed off but as someone who’s been in a relationship like this before, I’m standing my ground on this one.

So AITA for doing this? Or should I just drive her?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I complained about an arrangement set up between a caregiver and I?,"
I am a single mom and couldn’t afford to pay much for a nanny. I only need 3 days a week, 6pm-11pm. Baby is 11 months old. 


I found a lady who would do it for 10/hr in exchange for childcare help and Spanish tutoring for her 8 year old.  I said great and we’ve been doing this for a little while now.


Problem: she’s asking me to watch her kid 3-4 days a week for up to 8 hours at a time. Im also supposed to be doing Spanish tutoring during this time.


The kid is obviously much older than my kid so we don’t have much here for her to play with. She’s verrrrry loud and she is down right disrespectful when it comes time to practicing Spanish. I always say something in Spanish then English and she’ll sometimes TELL me to stop speaking Spanish or she’ll say “I’ll do what you ask  IF you ask in English only” 


Maybe this is normal for 8 year olds but I’m not a professional caregiver and I don’t have a kid this age. Either way, I’m feeling taken advantage of but I don’t know if I’m being entitled due to her accepting a lower wage. I was told in a local group that 17-20 was average for 1 kid in our area. 


I really want to say something because I feel like I’m paying her for childcare. She’s using me for childcare and not paying but her kid is considerably more demanding of attention. My baby is asleep most of the time.

AITAH for snapping at my Dad,"A little context: I’m 24 years old, fresh out of college, living at home, and transitioning from a 12/hr job to a 14/hr job. Things are moving a little slow but I’m working and trying to get my feet on the ground enough to move out. 

I’ve slept on the same twin bed pretty much my entire life. I’m starting to notice that it’s causing me back problems and so I figured i would ask my Dad if would pitch in for a new bed. I would pay for most of it, maybe even pay him back what he paid. I found a few really good priced full beds (even a couple queens). This upset my Dad for some reason.

“I slept in a twin bed until I married your mom” he told me. This is when I started feeling a little privileged. A lot of people would LOVE to have any sized bed. But I felt pretty confident I could mostly afford something bigger. In my mind if I got at least a full sized bed I could take it with me when I decide to move out and not have to buy an entire new bed. “As long as you live here you can sleep in a twin. It’s all you need”. He never agreed to the full but he told me “you have to go to the mattress firm. ALWAYS. wanna know why? Why you ask?” 

This is where I was starting to get irritated. My entire life my Dad has always made me feel a little inferior. He just recently started this “wanna know why? Guess why. I’ll tell you why” after every sentence thing and I guess it got to me. So I said “what for? It’s not the only option” and he shooed me away and said “forget it you’re on your own”.  Admittedly I said what I said kinda shrewdly. I was extremely tired from working in the sun all day and hadn’t eaten (which isn’t an excuse to be a dick) but I wanted to see if there were better prices at other places and I was kind of irritated at him not budging from the idea of twin for some reason. 

I felt so bad. Here I am asking for help and I felt like I bit the hand that feeds me. I apologized to him to which he responded “yeah I’m the wrong person to get mad at” which I’m not sure what he meant but that’s kinda just how he communicates I guess. I’m just not sure I have the guts to ask for help again. The whole thing made me feel like a 24 year old brat who just gets mad when things don’t go his way. 

At the end of the day I’m an adult and will probably buy the full on my own dime. It’s not a big deal. Just didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings.",Not the A-hole

AITA for arguing with my mom over my future?,"I (17F) just got into a huge argument with my mom about my future. I am going to be a senior in high school this year, and my school has a requirement that all students take a math class all 4 years of high school regardless of how many credits you have. I am an ambitious individual, so I’m about 3 years ahead of my schools typical math curriculum. I took AP calculus BC my junior year, so now the school has no more math classes to offer me. So they told me I could either take statistics (FYI I took statistics in middle school but the credit didn’t transfer) or I could sign up for a college course and they would count that as my math class for the year. I opted to take the college course since why not earn more credit for college while I’m at it. Well my mother did not like that, saying that I wasn’t ready for a college course and I would be wasting my money. Now I looked into a program that my local state university does where high school students can earn college credit. It’s $400 for the course and you only pay if you pass the class. I saved up the money and decided yo register for the class. However I ran into a problem when my schools schedules came out and instead of giving me senior release they put me in statistics. I went to the school to see why this was, and they told me that I couldn’t take a college course and not have a math class there. Which frustrated me because they had told me that I could take a college course and have that count. The school won’t listen to me since I’m not an adult. I tried to get my mother to help me, however she is refusing since this was a waste of time anyways. I told her that I am her child and that I don’t understand why she won’t help me so I can have a good future. This ended in a big fight, I ended up backing a back pack and staying at my friends house for a while. My mom stands by her decision that I don’t need to take a college course and I could settle with with statistics.

AITA for staying up later then my wife to play games?," 

Hey everyone,

I (M/25) usually get to bed around 1-2 AM, and my wife (F/25) usually goes to bed around 10 AM. She has to be up for work in the morning, but I have no responsibilities (Im a teacher and am off for the summer, but I do occasionally pick up small things like 5 day summer math camps or tutoring sessions if the pay is good). Me staying up later is purely for myself, I get very bored during the day while she's not here and I prefer to sleep while she works, do things with her when she gets back, and then play games with my friends who are only online from like 10pm-2AM.

Ever since she first brought it up about a month ago, their has not been a night that she has not complained about something. When I come in while she's sleeping, she will tell me the next day that I woke her up. If I sleep in the guest bed, she will freak out about how I don't care about her and don't want to be with her. I tried setting up a laptop with earbuds so I could just like watch movies online with people and type to them and hang out that way while in bed with her but the second I walked into the room with the laptop she got really upset and started crying and I just spent like 3 hours laying in bed awake doing nothing and she was still mad at me in the morning because I was moving around to much in bed and kept her up. I tried to stay with her in bed a few days in a row, and she still complains about it witch is insanely frustrating for me because I just want the issue to be gone.

She has started getting really mad at me for this, making rude comments about it, things telling me that she doesn't want to see me or talk to me because I don't want to see her, throughout the day.

In her defense, I could probably maintain a sleep schedule as if I was working if I stopped hanging out with my friends online, but part of the reason I went into this career is to have summers off and it seems like such a pointless reorganization of my life and I would have to sacrifice a lot of things I value so that I can be a like, sleep accessory for her and its really frustrating for me.

Also, I play games 2 floors down from her in the basement, and she cant hear it or see any lights at all.

WIBTA if I uninvite some friends from my graduation party?,"Mandatory I’m from mobile and English is not my first language. 

I (F25) just obtained my master degree and since in my country is finally possible to celebrate after months of lockdown, I’ve decided to invite some of my friends for a night out. 
Two of them (E and G, both M25) were super happy when I invited them one month ago so I started planning with D (F26) to stay for a weekend at her house, which is in a big town nearby and throw a lil party there. One month passed and last week I sent to all my friends the link to listen to my dissertation since everything was online, but nor E or G replied to my text. When I wrote another message a couple of day after to tell them what we planned for the weekend, I had to wait a whole day for a reply. 
The dissertation was yesterday, and not only I did not receive a single “congratulation”, but neither they told us what their intentions are for the weekend. Moreover, D is kinda upset because they automatically assumed we were going to stay at her house before we had the time to tell them. Long story short, we felt like they didn’t care about the graduation nor the fact that they’ll be hosted by a third party without paying a dime, showing an upsetting degree of lack of interest for everything we were planning. 
Yesterday night D and I had some time to talk about the situation and we concluded that their rudeness left both of us really angry, and now we are not sure if we still want to go partying as planned.

AITA for laughing about a friend's social media post?,"""Ken"" posted a sponsored post on Good Friday (which is centred around a death). I thought it was not a good idea to reference the religious day in the caption (in this manner- ""it is not just a good friday but a good friday to shop at \*insert business\*"") and **I explained this to Ken immediately**. Ken told me he had no say in the caption, that it was provided by the business and that he had no personal issue with the caption **even after hearing my explanation** and that he would not edit the post or take it down.

I do observe Good Friday and I told my other friends who also observe Good Friday about the odd reference and we laughed about the absurdity of it. Ken found out about this and was upset at me for bringing attention to his post. I told him that when he chose to post something on his public social media account with lots of followers he should expect it to gain attention and that is literally the reason why a business is paying him to post. Furthermore, my friends did not even know him personally and I did not show them the post (only told them about it). I also said that since I warned him beforehand he signed up for all sorts of reactions when he decided to keep the post as it was. Ken responded by calling me a bad friend for not considering how he feels before calling attention to the post and in the way I spoke to him during the conversation.

I agree that I was unkind.

We ended the argument without resolving the matter because I heard all he had to say and he was not listening to what I had to say. He then indirected me on social media and said that I should be more mature and keep my mouth shut **even if something is hurting me,** and according to him, that is what he does (which is clearly untrue). I refused to go back and forth indirectly and I replied saying that that is unhealthy behaviour and upsetting incidents should be discussed openly and resolved either by a compromise or otherwise. He continued indirecting me and I decided to log off to avoid the indirects for a few days. A few days later, I was out with my other friends when I received from Ken screenshots of all his indirects that I missed while I was off social media and a long paragraph telling me I was problematic because he literally never fights with anyone except me and that I must be the problem. He also named some mutual acquaintances who agreed with him on that point. He also brought up details of past fights we had in his long text + called me creepy for asking to hang out after not seeing him for a long time (isn't this a normal thing to do between friends?). I was extremely distressed by the text because it implied that (1) I was unloveable, (2) many people thought so, and (3) someone who I thought was a friend has been keeping receipts of past fights to use against me and he might not be a friend after all. I told him exactly that and I said that there is no point for us to contact each other ever again and blocked him everywhere.

For a while after that, friends would tell me that he was publicly bashing me on social media and occasionally I do wonder if I could have handled the situation better (kinder?), so AITA?

Edit: Removed some details to avoid accidentally making my identity obvious.

I also want to add that I suspect that the caption was 100% Ken's own idea as other friends who were sponsored by the same business were allowed to quite a bit of freedom with captions and Ken eventually edited his caption as well.

Edit 2: I anticipated the hate on religion but everyone's entitled to their own beliefs. I did not make him take it down or change the post. I only let him know that it might not be the best idea and eventually let him do whatever he wanted because it is his account, not mine. Telling my friends about it was not about talking crap about Ken or being pissed at him, it was more of a ""hey guys guess what I saw today"".",Asshole

(Nothing serious he just came home in a bad mood and I accidentally broke one of his potted plants while moving some of our stuff and he was mad bc we had no pots to replace it.) So anyway I trip over the stupid painting and just decided to take out my frustration and cut the canvas clean off the bars.

Husband sees the empty bars and says something along the lines of ""I can't believe that you would do that to that painting after I said I wanted to keep it."" And storms into our bedroom.

As something that I created I feel like I should decide what I want to do with it! Looking at the painting did not make me feel good I felt regret and failure And all the icky feelings that stuck with me while I was in art school. Everything about downsizing says DONT KEEP STUFF THAT MAKES YOU FEEL BAD!!

AITA for telling my bf his friend needs to grow up?,"So one of my best friends Nick came over my house a few nights ago and my boyfriend was playing video games with his friends(he had a webcam on so they could all see one another), one of them named Adam.

My friend Nick is kind of a “goofball” as you would say; he loves people and is a fun guy who likes to joke around and have fun. My bf recently got a promotion at work; so Nick goes into his room and shows his buttcheeks on the camera just to mess with my bf and goof off.

Well my bf later starts going on about how Nick is a weirdo and how his friends don’t like him for doing it. I understand that this is weird, but I also feel that they need to all lighten up a little bit because he was just joking around, even though I agree it was maybe a little over the top.

We are supposed to go on vacation with a group of people, and Nick and Adam are going to be going on the trip. My bf was saying how Adam now has a bad first impression of Nick over this. 

I was beginning to get frustrated at how big of a deal my bf was making this. His friends aren’t exactly innocent either. Adam constantly talks about his masturbation and porn habits and other things people don’t ask to hear— yet he calls Nick weird. I told my bf Adam needs to grow up bc if he can share graphic private details like that, he can accept seeing buttcheeks.

AITA for crying when my friend yelled at me?,"I (15F) went to one of my friends birthday parties. for some backstory, my ex's sister (20F) had messaged me about my friends and asked if they were being potentially trafficked. I wasn't sure, so I messaged my friend (15F) right away, we'll call her Sophie. She said she was okay, and I asked her to message me if she needed anything. At my friends party, a lot of people were not sober. I was one of the only sober ones, and had been in my friend (17M)'s garage with some other people. Sophie, wasn't sober and was having a hard time breathing and thought she was going to puke. My guy friends mom came out and got her into a bed, and tried to keep her from throwing up and get her to feel better. My other friend (16F) brought her upstairs with his mom. She came back out to the garage and yelled at me for not going up there with her. I'm quite a sensitive person, so I can't handle when anyone yells at me no matter who it is, so I began crying. I grabbed my stuff and went up to where Sophie was, but I could still hear everyone in the garage making fun of me for crying. My guy friends mom asked if I was okay, and I said that she had yelled at me and told me to go back to the garage. My other friend (15M) was waiting for me to see if I was okay downstairs. I began crying more, and ran straight into the bathroom and had a panic attack. It's been around a week since this has happened, and my friend that yelled at me and her boyfriend have been making fun of me for crying and for anything else I do. My ex boyfriend and I recently broke up so they make fun of me for being single, and her boyfriend messaged me as a joke and said he was in love with me. They also had one of my guy best friends do the same thing, and then make fun of me when I said I wasn't interested and that I knew it was a joke. They keep leaving me out whenever they all hangout as a group. I don't know what to do anymore. They won't talk to me and I've tried to explain myself but they don't care and just won't respond to me.

AITA for proposing that my friend pay (proportionally) more rent than me?,"So my(23F) best friend(24F) and I are are going to live together in San Francisco. 

Initially, I planned to move by myself for a job, where I'm making a decent salary, and enough to get a decently nice 1 bedroom apartment in the city(goal was to stay around 2k/mth). 

My friend decided that she wants to move too, which is great! I'd be happy to have a friend in a new state. However, her budget is way lower, and that's okay - she can only spend \~800 MAX/mth(which, based on what she told me, even seems like a little stretch) without depleting her savings.  Because of this, we agreed that it was better for her if she lived with me in a short term lease, making out max rent ~2800 for 2 bedroom, so that she wasn't living in a not-so-great area or anything. Plus, she'll be able to move her stuff to my house and just have it moved with mine, basically eliminating a large part of moving costs. She would only be living with me for 6 months, until she can find a job that is better suited and pays a better wage. 

She didn't care or want to be involved in looking at apartments, choosing one, incl. cost as long as it was within budget etc, but I ended up between two, with a difference in overall price incl parking and pet fees(~3000 vs. ~2600). I decided to opt for the cheaper option, because I would be able to drop down to only 1800 a month which is nice for saving money. However, I had just assumed that due to the rent difference, she would still pay the same. I did lower hers by \~$70(but this was counteracted by higher additional fees - parking is more expensive at this one, and we're each paying for our own parking), but in comparison, I would be saving \~$400 each month. 

When I sent her the \~proposed\~ cost breakdowns(like I said, she gave me full decision making authority. splitting everything up- rent is as I wrote, addtl like utilities, wifi etc. will be split down the middle), she was really upset with me. Not because she didn't like the apartment, but because she felt like I was giving myself additional ""fun"" money while she was still paying right at her limit(whereas I am below mine). I 100% see where she is coming from because she will be paying proportionally a lot more, and I can't stop feeling guilty about it - but my thought process is that while I love her and am happy to live together, I ultimately agreed to it to help her move to the city she wants to be in in affordable way. I don't know if I should feel guilty or not and would appreciate if anybody could tell me if I'm being a selfish asshole here! 

&#x200B;

note - I know that this rent is kinda high, but I've always wanted to live in the CITY city and was planning on doing so before she decided to move with me. I know I could find a cheaper apartment outside the main area to help us both financially, but I also don't know the good/bad areas as I'm kinda just blindly signing a lease online. So to me, a more expensive apartment leads me to feel more comfortable about the blind signing, so it wasn't really an option in my head (that may be super stubborn, but we haven't signed a lease yet so if she wants to look into living alone outside the city for less that would be totally ok!!)",Not the A-hole
AITA for not celebrating my birthday with my auntie?,"Long story short, I had lived with my auntie since 2014 but moved away to college in 2018. Our birthday is 3 days apart, so we used to celebrate ours together.

It is going to be my 21st birthday, and she mentioned that she has taken a week off work to go to Las Vegas for it. Initially, I said yes because the trip sounded fun. However, I changed my mind later due to an increase in COVID cases.

I texted her that I am going places with my friends instead, she and I can celebrate together on her birthday because I can always drive down to see her. She replied: ""That means we don't need to celebrate with you"", ""Forget it."", ""We are doing our own"". The way she texted sounded sarcastic (?), and it made me feel guilty for not celebrating with her.

This is gonna be THE FIRST TIME I celebrate with other people instead of her. Am I the asshole of canceling the trip and not celebrating my birthday with her together?

AITA for wanting my niece/nephew to come over?,"I have a teenage niece and a teenage nephew, as well as two teens of my own (so they are cousins). My niece lives nearby and my nephew lives out of state. He comes to town 1-2x / yr for a total of 4-5 weeks over the two visits. He stays with my mom but the four kids often want to get together, either at my house or my moms house. 

My husband seems to have an issue when I have my niece/nephew over here, like rolling his eyes, acting put-upon, saying he had no idea they’d be over. My kids have remarked on this as well. I’ve now begun to only (as much as possible) have them over when my husband is at work. 

I/our kids DO ask husband if he minds, if such and such day/time is good to have them over. Not permission, just what I consider to be courtesy to the other person living in our house. Even if he says yes, he often says later he didn’t know they’d be over, or he asks why the kids have to spend so much time with their cousins (see timeframe above ^).

AITA here? I don’t think so, as we do ask, and it’s not all year long or excessive. But I’d like other opinions. This is putting me in an awkward spot with my family as I have to come up with excuses for only having my niece/nephew over at certain times - as well as risking the annoyance of my husband.",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting to live alone even though my roommate can’t afford rent by themselves?,"Basically, my lease is up in 6 months. My roommate/best friend and I had a talk about what we were going to do about renewing or moving. I told my roommate that since I’m graduating university and will have a good paying job in my field, that I’m looking to move into a place where I can live by myself. I’ve mentioned this before because I’ve talked about getting another dog when I get my own place after graduation. She flipped out on me and said she doesn’t make enough to pay rent on her own and that I’d be screwing her over by leaving. I told her I was sorry but I would be more comfortable living by myself, and it wasn’t like I told her right before the lease was up. She keeps saying if I actually cared about her that I would renew the lease and stay another year and I could live by myself after that. Living with my best friend hasn’t been the best experience and I really would just like a place of my own. 

I feel like I might be the asshole for leaving her in a place where she’s not good financially. I don’t want her to not be able to afford to live, but I also feel like that’s not my responsibility or problem to worry about.

AITA?

EDIT: I just wanted to add some context info: I am a student, she is not. Her career choice required an associates degree whereas mine requires a bachelor’s, so she’s done with school. Also, she does not budget well and spends a lot of money online shopping. Like A LOT. Her finances are not my business so I don’t comment on that, but if I’m being honest she would save a lot if she didn’t order something she didn’t need off of Amazon or shein every week. That being said, even if she cut down on online shopping out two bedroom would be quite expensive for one person (around $950).

As of right now, my plan is to give both of us time to cool off and think. I plan on talking to her next week and offering to help her look for a roommate (since I’m still in school I always see adds for roommates) or for a cheaper one bedrooms place. I want to emphasize to her that I’m not moving out because I dislike her or want her to struggle, but because I’m at a point in my life where I’m able to do so. I think six months is plenty of time to arrange these things. I love my best friend dearly, but I didn’t think through living with her and that’s on me.",Not the A-hole

AITA for applying to work where my BFF works knowing she doesn't want me to work there?,"I live in small town with few career opportunities. In my 20’s I would go to my good friends for odd jobs, let’s call them Owner Man (OM) and Owner Woman (OW) because they eventually own a company. 

They connect me to a job at Company 1. When Company 1 was hiring, I suggested my good friend for the job, lets call her BFF. She had been working in this field at a lower position, and this would be a step up for her. I’m offered a better position with a different company, and I leave Company 1. BFF stays on with them. 

Company 1 changes management, and OM and OW (this is when BFF first meets them) are put in charge. OM and OW leave Company 1 and start Company 2, they take BFF with them. Meanwhile, I’m living in another town and working a high level position in our field.

I came back to our small town bringing remote work with me where I traveled about 50%. The pandemic changed things, and the job became 100% travel, forcing me to quit due to burnout.

This is when I would normally contact OM and OW and ask for work. I didn’t know BFF had objections, so I asked, “hey do you guys have any openings? I’m thinking about leaving current job.”  This is when I found out she didn’t want me to work there. Her reason is that I’m her friend and that’s her job and she doesn’t want to combine those worlds. But we’re all friends. We hang out sometimes. I’ve known them longer than I’ve known her. She also doesn’t want to ruin our friendship by working together.

I’ve brought it up many times. Citing: there isn’t work in this town, working together at Company 1 was great, and I got you that original job. She basically made fun of me for trying to take credit for her job, but all I meant is that in this situation reversed, I helped her. I don’t think she owes me her career. 

BFF became competitive with me in the last few years. It seemed she wanted us to be the same even tho I started in this field years before her, have been promoted above her, have more education than her, and am almost a decade older than her. 

BFF has a huge crush on OM. She thinks OM has a crush on me. I think her crush on OM is immature and needs to end because it affected her last romantic relationship, as well as affects her at work when she gets too flushed to speak. I don’t think OM has a crush on me, but I do think he enjoys my company.

I admitted to OM that I want to apply at Company 2, but that BFF doesn’t support. He is shocked and stoked about adding me to the team. Later, I interview with OM and OW. 

I met with BFF and talked to her about it one last time. I said that I would be in different department than her, doing different job. She asked me what they were offering for the position, and I fucked up because I told her. Huge mistake but I was caught off guard. What a fucking death stare. She’s heard of salary transparency within a company, but she doesn’t understand thats meant for people working the same job. She wants to make more than me because seniority. I don’t agree.

AITA for delivering a non-tipper's pizza last and then refusing redelivery?,"I was the only driver working, due to the restaurant being short staffed.

This one lady ordered, and then two minutes later, two more orders came in.  So I had to take a triple.

The first time I delivered to her, she shouted at me to just leave the pizza on the porch.  The second time, I just left it there.  She didn't pre-tip so there was no chance for me to get a tip when I just left it.

The other two orders had pre-tips of $18 and $6 each (the $18 tip was for like 7 pizzas and wings).  They were all in opposite directions, North, East, and South.  So I took the big tipper's, then the medium tipper's, then hers.  By the time I got there it had been 70 minutes since she ordered and as I rolled up, she came out of the house to shout at me for being late.

She asked ""why the fuck did it take so long"" so I straight up told her that I had three orders spread out, and that since she didn't tip, I took hers last.  This set her OFF.  She shouted about how I didn't know she wasn't gonna tip, and then called me a racist (I'm white, she's black).

So she called up the store and told my manager that I'm a racist, lied and said I yelled at her, this that and the other, and demanded a new fresh pizza.  I was the only guy working and we had two other orders I needed to take, so I told the manager that I, quote, ""Am never gonna deliver to that lying bitch again.""

My manager was cool with it, he knows about customer complaints I guess.  So he told her that she'd get a refund but that we couldn't send another order out today.

She complained to corporate, and apparently the district manager called my in-store manager, who talked down the DM and said something like ""we can't afford to lose staff right now""

WIBTA if I refuse to help my parents for another year,"Throwaway but please don't cross post.

Hello folks,

so, my (28m) parents (50f and 65m) own a restaurant in my home town for nearly 25 years. Like everybody in the service industry knows, staff is hard to find and the restaurant was always understaffed.

Consequently,  during my time as a teen, I helped my parents in the restaurant. First doing minor things, ending up doing shifts at least twice a week and on holidays as well as a lot of other stuff. Fast forward seven years, and I finished my master degree in data science. I am proud in having managed to get good grade during my studies, getting work experience during several working student jobs and now landed a good job in software development. All while still working at the restaurant regularly at the weekends and on holidays. 

My parents wanted to buy a smaller restaurant after I moved to a nearby city for my master studies (4 years ago). Always saying that they will find something soon,  and that they won't require my help when this small restaurant opens. However, Corona hit our country. Before Corona hit, I told my parents that I won't help them anymore in the restaurant, when I start my real job. And they seemed to accept that. Fortunately, my parents found a small restaurant they will open in the summer. This lead me to believe that things will change. And I started my first real job this year's April.

Now, after a lot of regulations are relaxed they reopened the restaurant. I called them, to ask them how things were. My parents told me how they have a lot of work, since many waiters are not excited to return. Then my father asked me when I work again. I reminded him of our conversation that I won't work there again, and he only mumbled ""Well, we will see."".

Last week, I met with my mother. She was really stressed, telling how much work they have. She said my father pushed her to ask me if I can help again. Only for this last year.

My mother is doing the operative work, like cooking and staff organisation. While my father does the business stuff and ""customer relations"". And yes, the last part involves drinking alcohol with the customers during the work. He didn't asked me, since he knows I sympathize more with my mother, since he could do more work in my opinion and I told him that more than enough. I feel like he exploits my pity.

I feel like if i agree again, they continue to ask me to help in the small restaurant as well and thinks will never change. I canceled a lot of private meetings with friends, or neglect my own private studies because of the restaurant. Leading to a lot of resentment towards my parents.",Not the A-hole
Aita for calling my mom a child over how she is treating her new relationship,"I’m a 20 year old female, my mom is 45. Her and my dad split up around 6 years ago. She actually was married a second time after my dad. That didn’t go well. They dated for a year and got married. Divorced a year after that. So my mom has a tendency to jump into things and avoid red flags. 

My mom started seeing Dave about 4 weeks ago. They met through a mutual friend. Immediately I started seeing the red flags. First off, Dave is in his late 40s and has no charge card. I found that very strange. Second and more importantly, since they started going out 4 weeks ago I think there was literally one or two days where they did NOT see eachother. 

I tried to tell my mom I think she’s moving too fast with this. Like I’m not joking they already see eachother everyday. He takes her out to lunch during work than comes over at night. He always comes over because he still lives with his ex wife, they are separated but divorce isn’t finalized. So that’s weird. 

Mom also acts weird around Dave. She plays dumb and acts like a ditz when she is in fact not. It all came to a head yesterday when she randomly tells me and my younger sister 

“by the way you guys need to figure something out for Thanksgiving this year. Dave is flying me to Florida to meet his family”

I said “mom you have to be kidding right? It’s July. Thanksgiving is 4 months away. Don’t you think it’s a little early to make thanksgiving plans?”

She laughed it off and I asked if she thought she was rushing things. Since she’s been seeing Dave for only 4 weeks and she’s already planning a trip over thanksgiving with him. She got defensive and accused me of not wanting her to be happy. I told her that she’s a child. I told her she doesn’t even freaking know Dave. I told her how she went from not knowing this man, meeting him one day and spending every single day with him afterward. Now planning thanksgiving together. 

I think she’s being crazy, i don’t know what to do.

Edit: I also was put off by the way she just immediately accepted the Florida invitation without considering spending the holiday with her kids and her family. It’s like already the most important person in her life is Dave right now. Sounded like she didn’t hesitate at all and was ecstatic to go with him, and we are an afterthought.

AITA for thinking/wanting my husband to hire a babysitter or make arrangements for our 8 year old?,"Backstory for context: My husband and I split up for about a year. We had quite a few rough years, fighting got horrible, and it was the best decision at the time for everyone involved. Our arguments mostly revolved around him not doing anything with me outside of the home and my response to that. He owns his own business and many times works crazy hours of his own choice. He’s a perfectionist and great at what he does, but he really struggles knowing when to call it a day and give his family time priority. For instance, he’ll work from 6am-9pm than he’s so exhausted when he comes home he eats and watches tv until he sleeps. On his off days, he usually wants to relax and not go anywhere because he’s understandably tired from his schedule. I complained, haggled, tried to convince him, asked for just two dates a month, yelled, cried…it didn’t change anything for the better. I gave up trying and just started to live my own life, making friends and leaning on them as my marriage fell apart. No cheating on any side, just disconnect. It was really sad and painful for everyone.  

We split and I moved out of the marital home. We shared custody 50/50. Time and distance and COVID isolation brought us back together again and we became friends first, than decided we wanted to make it work. We still live separate, but I spend most of my time at the house we own. As we slowly started spending more time together, he kept up with making arrangements for our daughter during his week whether that be having his family watch her or adjusting his schedule unless I said I was available. But now, it’s feels very much on me again, which with his hours make it hard for me to do much socializing with friends or to get out of the house without a child. 

He will do things with me now outside of the home if I ask, but I can’t help feeling like we’re falling into the same rut. I accept that we have different social needs, that he does need his down time but since we don’t share financial burdens anymore, it feels like I’m giving more. 

AITA for thinking/wanting to discuss with him that I would like him to resume his babysitter arrangements at least a couple days a week so I can schedule some time for myself? 

BTW, I’m full work from home for over a year now do to COVID. My social activities used to be working out, swing dance, events in our area such as concerts, meeting friends for drinks…so essentially the last year and four months I’ve been a homebound remote worker/teacher assistant to my virtual student.

I feel like I might be the AH because he’s working hard and parenting is a team effort, it feels a little selfish to be trying to work it out and asking him to arrange for care during his week, but than I also feel like he should be more thoughtful of my needs too.  Idk 😑😩",Not the A-hole
AITA for working as an intern for two weeks,"A few months ago, my uncle (semi-retired) offered me an internship at his company during summer vacation. I was pretty grateful for it as I saw it as an opportunity to gain some experience and pocket money. Only minor issue was that I would only be able to work there for 2 weeks as I had prior plans with my father as well as my friends for the remainder of the summer. I label this as an ""issue"" since my uncle initially offered me work for a month, though he said that I should contact his company's head of admin to arrange for my wage, work duration and working hours. So I told the company's head of admin that I would only be able to work there for 2 weeks and she said that it would be no problem.

The work experience itself went quite well. My uncle was happy that I wanted to work part time at his firm.

Fast forward 3 days past the last day of my internship, my step-aunt texts and asks why I could only work for 2 weeks. I reply along the lines of  ""The work experience was great though I had some other plans for the summer which were made beforehand and that I simply didn't have the time to work for a full month."" She then replies with a long, passive-aggressive message. She says that I shouldn't take the job in the first place if I already have ""so many personal commitments"". And that I was lucky I  was working in a company that belonged to my uncle's - who thought I was working for a month. No word from my uncle himself though. She finished off the message with the typical ""guess this is how the new generation thinks"" and wished me good luck

Honestly a little bit confused since I arranged my internship with the company's head of admin who was totally fine with everything and told everyone in the workplace that I would be there for 2 weeks when I first arrived. So AITA?

AITA for “fat shaming” my daughter?,"My mother and I were shopping for upholstery fabric yesterday and I took my daughter (4 months old) as my husband was at work. The fabric store in question has a ramp to the first floor but stairs to the second floor, where the upholstery is, so I was holding my daughter instead of pushing her in the stroller.

While my mother was looking through fabrics I was talking to my daughter - just baby talk, cooing babbling etc. At one point I was squishing her cheeks and calling her “my sweet little chunk.” I also might have commented on how she’s getting to be “a big girl” ie heavy and harder to carry around, as my arms were getting a little tired.

A nearby woman heard this and became very upset. She said that my comments were evidence of fatphobia and I was already starting to fat-shame my daughter. She claimed this would impact my daughter’s self esteem for years to come and I was doing irreparable damage to her mentally. 

I was shocked- I love my baby’s chubby cheeks and sausage arms. I thought it was just regular baby talk. But the woman was somewhat larger herself so she probably knows more than I do about the matter. She was getting very emotional about my internalized fatphobia. 

So I ask you - did I use hateful language? Even if it was well meaning I don’t want to give my daughter a bad feeling about herself.",Not the A-hole
AITA for yelling at my sister to train her dog,"Okay so to preface- I am NeuroDivergent, I struggle with an auditory processing disorder and it can be difficult for me to communicate my emotions properly a lot of the time. This is not to gain sympathy, just to say that this is something that comes into play later in the story. 

So I (M 17) was at home and my sister (F, 18) came over with her dog (about 5 months) -who she’s had since he was 2 months- because some people were coming to work on her car. That’s not important. What’s important is that I’m sitting on the couch upstairs watching Tarzan and trying to relax, and her dog, who she has not tried to train at all (he’s still pissing on our carpets) and he has a really loud bark. Like really loud. 

So he’s running around upstairs and barking his little head off and I’m getting upset because it’s both mixing with the movie and drowning out my ability to focus so I pause the movie and he’s still barking. I look at my sister and she is not doing anything, just smiling and riling him up even more. 

He’s still barking. I’m trying to make him stop barking but he bites me if I reach towards him. So my hands are in pain and he’s screaming and I’m going to cry so I get really upset and scream at him. I only said his name. My sister then yells at ME, so I yelled back. 

I told her that she needs to teach him to stop barking since she lives in a one bedroom apartment and I’m sure her neighbors don’t appreciate his horribly loud bark at all hours of the day and night and that she needs to train him because I shouldn’t have to be the one to try to teach HER DOG not to bark. I said to take him outside until they leave because it’s physically painful for me to listen to him bark right into my ear. 

She stood up and took him outside and eventually left without saying goodbye. I don’t feel bad for defending myself but I thing she’s upset with me.  AITA?

Edit: I feel I should mention that I know no dog is going to be fully trained at 5 months old :) my two dogs (9 and 4) both took quite some time before they were fully trained, however both of my dogs were potty trained and taught volume control as puppies. Her dog still pees on the floor. Thank you all for the kind replies and suggestions :)",Not the A-hole
"AITA for refusing to pay ""my half"" of our cancelled wedding?","My ex-fiance and I came from very different cultural backgrounds. Our families live on entirely different continents. I explicitly told him before we even got engaged that I always wanted a small, low key wedding. I know that his culture have huge, lavish weddings and he told me that this is what he wants, so when we got engaged we had a long conversation which resulted in the compromise that we would have a big wedding in his home country but drop some of the other aspects of his culture that I wasn't so comfortable with, or did not mesh well with my own culture, regarding living situation and raising children (for future children, we did not have any children). This was not a huge amout of customs. In fact we just arranged to drop one and alter two so they streamlined better with my own culture.We were both as happy as possible with this outcome.

We began making booking, reservations and paying deposits for our wedding. This was all out of his bank account. This is because we did not have citizenship in eachothers countries so it was far less complicated for everything to be paid from an account of the same country. The intention was that after we married it would be much easier to get citizenship and once citizenship was approved we would merge our finances, and at this point it would not matter who had paid for the wedding, since all our money would be together.

Three weeks before we were married his mother and aunts got wind of one of the customs we had arranged to alter and lost it, through conversations they then found out about the other two and eventually they threatened to disown him for being a bad son. They said I was cutting him off from his family and that if that was what he wanted they would make it easier for him. 

He begged me to change my mind but i was firm saying this is what we decided together. I wasnt going to drop our agreement because his family dont like it, when there are plenty of aspects my own family are uncomfortable with. Relationships are about compromise and communication and ultimately the first priority are the two people in the relationship, not their family. 

He told me if I wouldn't budge then the wedding was off. I told I had made my compromise, I still wanted to marry him under our original conditions when we had spent a long time negotiating and originally felt were fair. He said he had changed his mind and did not want to marry me. 

After a few weeks he contacted me asking me to pay him back for half the money he was unable to get back from the deposits we paid. Since it was so close to the planned date that we cancelled, it was not a small amount of money, however since he was the one who called off the wedding and even at this point I would still marry him if he were to honour our original agreement I don't think I am obliged to pay. I told him this and he is very unhappy, since he now he believes is it my fault that he cancelled for being ""unwilling to be flexible"". 

AITA for refusing to pay my half of our cancelled wedding?

*Edit: It's come up a few times that if I were the one cancelling the wedding would I expect him to pay half the cost. I have replied to a few comments but its coming up enough that I figure I'd add something to the post.
If I had been the one cancelling without his approval, I would have expected to pay the cost alone, if it had been a mutual decision I would have expected to share the cost. 
In the context of our relationship, it makes sense for him to take the hit for this. There have been other (allbeit less significant) cancellations of events that have been covered by the person who cancelled, for example I was unable to make our planned engagement shoot and paid the cost for this. He was (precovid) unable to attend a prepaid dinner event, for which he covered the cost. We've always had a very balanced and understanding financial relationship.*

Edit 2:
I'll copy and paste an earlier comment regarding the traditions my ex-fiance compromised on:

 ""The traditions were regarding my role in the home as a wife and mother, multi-generational households and methods of raising children and the role of a child in the household.
I dont feel comfortable providing more information that this as I dont wish to give any more evidence towards our nationalities.""

Also, as a few of you have guessed, English is not my first language. I tried to hide it but I guess I still have improvements to make. All this is to say that I apologise for any mistakes in my post or comments.

-*

*Edit 3 (my apologies to the mods for so many):
My post was unclear and the misunderstanding seems to be directly effecting many people's judgement according to their comments, so I will clarify: We made no compromises on the actual wedding, the wedding was to be entirely traditional, as my ex fiance wished. This would also not have been a one day event, but spanning several days and events.*

*Additionally, it seems that not being explicit on what compromises we made has an effect on my judgement. When I wrote the post I didn't think this would effect my judgement and so I did not include it however it seems that I was wrong and therefore in the interest of a fair judgement I will explain. For context, our intention was to live in my home country, not his. I didnt realise until after, that he had not shared this plan with his family. This was why it was important to me that while we follow much of his culture, we also mix it as much as we can into my own.*

*The one custom I would not budge on rejecting was myself being required to be a homemaker and not go to work. I have a career I have worked hard for and I am proud of.*

*The first custom that we altered was that my ex fiance expected his family would come to live with us. We negotiated that while we would help them get citizenship so they they could live close to us, they would not live in our home. We agreed that the only family of his we would allow to live with us in our home would be his parents, and thisb would be if they were unable to take care of themselves any longer, or one of them had died, to avoid loneliness for the remaining parent.*

*The second custom that was altered was that to me it is very important that my children have a voice in the home and feel heard, that their opinions should be counted just as much as their parents. I wanted them bought up without a specific religion, but given the opportunity to chose once they are old enough. I also requested that punishments never be physical, and are not decided by other family members.*

*I understand many of you would like to know our nationalities, but unfortunately I have seen a lot of racism on reddit, and do not intend to fuel the fire of unnecessary comments towards my ex-fiance's country.*

AITA for telling my sister to mind her business about my weight loss?,"\*cw: discussion of food/weight\*

So, I (M21) have been on a health kick after my breakup. A small part of her reasoning was that I don’t take care of myself, and it was a huge wake up call for me. Now I eat smaller portions, keep track of my meals, I avoid carbs wherever I can, and I focus on getting more vitamins and minerals into my diet. I also got a gym membership and I try to get myself there for a workout most days a week now. If I can’t get out, I’ll at least go on a short run. And this has been really successful for me, I’ve gained so much confidence from this. It’s actually insane how differently I get treated by people now. And I’m carrying on with it, because I don’t want this to be a short-lived thing that I let slip, because it's so easy to lose progress.

So, I’m at our dad’s house, and my sister starts talking about my habits and kept asking how I got so much off in a few months, etc. I told her it’s just discipline, and she could do it, too, if she wanted, but that offended her, I think, because she asked to speak privately.

She expressed that she was worried, and that it sucks that I’ve started to change myself because of my ex. I told her it was for my wellbeing and that she sounded jealous. She told me that she’s far from it, and that she’s just looking out for me. It feels more to me like she’s just mad I’m doing better, like I can’t get my life together and upstage her perfect life or something. She said that she’s just being caring and that I shouldn’t be so defensive, and I told her to mind her own business and that she’s not my mom. We have a bit of an age gap, and our parents are divorced, so she’s always been a bit overprotective, but it’s starting to get to me that whenever I’m doing good, she has to swoop in and make it sound like a bad thing somehow. Like I'm some weak, fragile person. She got really hurt by this, and she said that I was being out of line. I don’t think what I said was unfair at all. I don’t get why she couldn’t just be happy for me, but my dad seems to be on her side, because he asked me if I was okay and that I should listen to her concerns and say sorry.

Now I don’t know anymore.

AITA for being angry at my mom for buying my sibling something?,"So, I have college coming up, and I've been asking my mom for a couple of months now if we could go shopping for things for my dorm. She tells me that she wants to wait until the week before move in day to go shopping. I don't like her way of thinking at all, but whatever. So, my sister got a new mattress the other day, and the exact same day, my mom buys her a new bedset (comforters and stuff). She also buys new curtains and a few small things for around the house. I'm not angry at my sister or anything, and it's not really the bedset or the curtains that I'm upset about (I understand that it was time for new ones), but for a long time, I've been noticing that when it comes to me needing and wanting things, she has no problem putting it off for the *very* last minute. I am missing a shot that I'm required to have, and she still hasn't taken me to get those, I ask almost every week ""Can we schedule a doctor's appointment today?"" I've been asking her if she could teach me how to drive, and every time I ask she gets angry and curt with me. I rarely ever ask her because either she will say yes and not take me or she just says no. So, when she came home with this stuff, I got angry. Not like bursting-with-rage angry, but ""you hurt me and I don't want to be near you"" angry.

AITA For blocking my gate?,"So I have a back garden gate that provides access to an alleyway. This means the next 3 houses up can access the alleyway through my garden. It’s not usually an issue as ordinarily people, such as the window cleaner normally ask. However the last couple of times it’s been used the individual has been leaving it wide open.

Whilst it’s irritating, it’s more the fact that I have a toddler and if my gate is open she would have direct access to the alleyway and then the road.

I messaged my neighbours and said I do not care whose leaving it open I just care that whoever it is stops because whilst my kid doesn’t go in the garden without supervision there’s been once or twice where she’s managed to get out there without us (sneaky bugger).

Anyways one of the neighbours was instantly defensive about how it couldn’t possibly be him or his teenage daughters and I reiterated I didn’t care who was just that whoever uses it needs to shut it behind them. If it happens again I’ll be buying a lock and then no one will be able to use it without knocking first.

I work from home and my partner is a predominately SAHD so it shouldn’t really be an issue. Anyways went out into my garden this evening and once again my gates been left wide open again. And I’m furious, I’d spoken to them all and told them I would put my kids safety before their accessibility and no one objected. 

So whilst fuelled by rage Ive ordered a sign and a hard core, would keep out zombies if necessary lock. Because screw whoever it is they’re potentially endangering my kid and knowingly doing so.

However in said fuelled rage I’d written on social media in a comment (not calling anyone an idiot) amazing restraint I know but making it clear that I’ve blocked the gate for now but I’ll be locking it from now on and I’ve had a ‘mixed’ response. So Reddit AITA for putting the safety of my kid over the ease of accessibility for my neighbours?

Edit: changed the word rant to a comment because whilst I was furious and venting whilst writing it the reality of it is the comment on social media was pretty bland in comparison to how I was feeling.

AITA for comparing kids to puppies?,"Backstory: I haven't spoken to my cousin in a long time due to a falling out. This falling out was caused by her reaction at a family party last year. Word was going around in the family that I was starting to get good at cooking meals and dessert, and that news made it's way to my cousin's ear. Let's call her H.

H's personality: Blunt. Humorous. Kind (when she wants to be). Vain. 

H made this delicious dessert and I asked her how long it took her to make it and what recipe she used. But, she ended the conversation with this: ""Yeah it's good huh?? Not anything near yours though, I don't add all the crazy shit and fluff you add to your food. I keep mine simple and see how it tastes? Delicious!"".

It was a backhanded compliment that I did not expect lol and  I don't think she realized who were around her when she said it because everyone had this face 😬 (including me) and her husband said, ""Hey, BoosyBoo has her way of cooking. You have your way of cooking. Everyone's dishes is unique in its own way, alright?""

H caught herself and knew she was being called out. H said, ""Am I talking to you?? Can you like, go watch the kids or something??""

That was the last time I wanted to talk to her because of her immature reaction/response. 

Present day; I get a text from H. H is asking how I am doing. Told her I am doing well and just got a new puppy.

H: Wow, so your new puppy and senior dog are living together with you huh? Must be a lot of work!

My response: It is a lot of work. My two dogs is like a taste of having kids. Your two kids must be pooping/peeing and screaming all the time so it's a lot of work for you. Mine also poops and pees all the time, and I have to constantly change the doggy pad. I am counting the calendar days until my puppy is one years old before I can leave him alone at home and not have to worry about him during work.

H: Excuse me? Did you just compare your puppy to actual kids?

My response: Yes I did, but what I meant to say is that taking care of kids obviously requires much more effort than taking care of dogs/puppies.

She stops texting me.

AITA for telling my cousin about the surprise party she really didn't want thrown for her?,"In 2005, my cousin was turning 30. My grandmother and others (including an unknown person who I didn't/ don't know) were planning a surprise party for her in August.  She didn't want one. She had just had a hysterectomy, doesn't like surprises, wasn't happy about turning 30 and really just didn't want a surprise party. 

While I visiting from out of town that summer, we were talking about the upcoming birthday.  It was a lot of ""they better not.. "" and ""I don't want.. "". After talking for a while, I did say that there was a plan for a surprise party.  She got angry and yelled. Then she made some calls and yelled at others.  When all was said and done, the party happened regardless. 

Bc I have have lived in another state all this time, I completely forgot about this incident 15 years ago. I was reminded of it last night when my cousin and some friend of hers (who I don't recall ever meeting) screamed at me for ruining the surprise. The surprise party that my cousin didn't want.  In 15 years, no one has mentioned disdain with my choice to tell her. No call, text, email. Nothing. 

I would want to know bc I hate surprises and grand gestures. I'm also the type to make someone aware-- hey, cops are sitting down on Old Monroe, slow down; hey a storm is headed your way, put your furniture up; and hey, ppl are planning a party, act surprised.

WIBTA if I canceled plans with a friend after it was “planned” out for two weeks?,"So I’m 21 and super busy in general since I work two jobs so I rarely have time that I can hang out with friends. Early last week, a friend of mine mentioned about taking a weekend trip with him and his boss to one of his vacation homes on the beach. I was reluctant since I knew I was working a lot but I reluctantly agreed thinking that it should be able to work out. Lo and behold since this conversation lasted like 5 minutes, I forgot about it (since I really don’t talk to this friend a lot). I went out for breakfast with my friend yesterday who told me that they already rented a fishing boat and we’re planning stuff with me. I told him I totally forgot about it and on top of that my mom informed me of an appointment I needed to go this week to (which was going to be on Saturday) with the next possible day I can schedule it for being in October. He seemed pretty peeved cause I guess he assumed I was 100% going. But then he actually told me where we were going and it was about a 3 hour drive one way from my house. Since I assumed we were going maybe an hour or hour and a half out, a 3 hour trip one way for a Saturday morning to Sunday morning/early afternoon trip is a lot for me considering I work about 10 hours the next day. With all these considerations, would I be the asshole if I flaked on this trip? I more so feel bad since he said they rented a fishing boat for exactly four people and they paid a lot for it so I feel like a dick if that money goes to waste. But I feel that at the same time, the trip wasn’t planned too well and I was informed of crucial details days before we had to go.

TLDR: I got invited on a beach trip (Saturday to Sunday) last week and I reluctantly agreed, not 100% agree. I forgot about it and I learned about an important appointment scheduled for Saturday where the next open slot is in a few months. In addition, I found out yesterday that this day trip is three hour drive one way and since we are staying Saturday morning- Sunday morning, I feel it’s way too far for a day trip and the trip wasn’t planned well (at least I was not informed about anything with this trip). I am considering flaking from this trip but I feel bad cause I found out yesterday they rented a boat and bought it with the intention of me being there and it costed a lot of money.

EDIT/UPDATE: I definitely see that I would be the asshole if I flaked on him and you guys did give valid reasoning for that as well. With the appointment, it is an orthodontist appointment and my mom has a habit of scheduling everything and never telling me when they are actually happening. But I called my friend today, told him that I was going and now we have a pretty solid plan now for what we are doing so thank you guys for your inputs.",Asshole
AITA for calling my mom a bigot for repeatedly misgendering/dead naming me?,"I am FTM transgender and raised by two Christian parents who divorced when I was 7. I have experienced gender dysphoria since I was 3, but I did not have the language/resources to realize it until I was 18. I lived with my mother until 2 years ago when the dysphoria made me extremely depressed. For religious reasons, she would not allow me to begin HRT while I was ""under her roof"". The depression got so bad I had to move out to live with some family friends, that way I could begin HRT. So far, I've become more comfortable in my body.

My mother still calls me by my deadname and misgenders me while I'm around her. Over the 2 years I've been gone, I've become disappointed and frustrated with her lack of regard for how it feels when she says those things. It hurts *a lot.*

Today my frustration got the best of me. While we were on the phone, I said she was a bigot. She acted indignant, but still continued to call me by my deadname. When she did it again, I finally shouted ""stop calling me (deadname)!"", and she immediately hung up.

Earlier today, I called her to apologize for losing my temper. When she did not answer, I apologized via text. After accepting the apology and saying I ""should be sorry"", she texted me a screenshot of the definition of ""bigot"", as well as the following message:

""Read the above definition of a bigoted person. 
I do not hate you or anyone with your struggles. Nor am I intolerant of you. But....you are very intolerant and have no compassion for anyone but yourself. 
The sad thing is, you don't even see the hate oozing from your own mouth. I know for a fact not every one struggling with gender issues has the hate you have for the family struggling along with them but in a different way. Some have compassion and love for their family. I am so sad that you are such a angry bitter person who seeks their own comfort. 
If anything your struggle has made me more compassionate and made me reach out to another person with your same issue. I understand better how maturity and the fact of loving family members for where they are in life makes life better. I am sorry to see your self esteem and confidence in who you are depends so much on others. 
Unfortunately you fit the definition of a bigoted person yourself.""

If I were an outsider looking into this situation, I'd gladly call my mother a bigot as well. However, I've regrettably observed selfish tendencies in myself, much to my shame. Thus, when she throws out this language that implies I'm selfish for asking her to stop calling me by my deadname, I'm always apprehensive. It doesn't seem like it's much to ask a person to stop calling you by a certain name, but it also feels like I'm asking too much. Also, notice that I said I've asked her to only stop calling me by my deadname, not call me my new name.

AITA for calling my boyfriend a “job stealing immigrant?”,"After writing it down, I’ve realized how bad my title sounds, but hear me out.

I (M16) and my boyfriend “Mike” (M16) tease each other a lot. Like, a lot. We’re not like that all the time, but I’m sure you get the point.

A few years ago, I came out to my grandfather as gay, and he called me a “perverted homosexual.” I was never really close with him, so I kind of thought it was funny that he called me that. I told Mike about what had happened, and mimicking my grandpa, repeated what he said. It was so stupid, and from then on, he would sometimes call me by that title. 

Now, here, I have to explain that Mike is Mexican. He’s not even an immigrant, and neither are his parents.

When my grandfather saw my boyfriend at a family zoom meeting, he started making jokes about illegal immigrants, and it made us kind of uncomfortable. When we told him to stop, it turned into a heated argument, with everyone else in the meeting taking sides. Eventually, he just called my boyfriend a “job stealing immigrant” and left the meeting.

My boyfriend and I made fun of our grandpa together, making jokes to make him, and I started copying my grandpa’s racist rant, ending with something like, “Whatever, you job stealing immigrant. Let’s go eat ice cream.” Over the past few weeks, it’s evolved into a teasing nickname. Now I call him my “job stealing immigrant,” and he calls me a “perverted homosexual.”

So here’s when things got a bit heated. I was on a phone call with my Mike while my sister was driving me somewhere, and I casually called my boyfriend his nickname. After the call, my sister went all quiet for a while until we parked, and asked me if I had just called my boyfriend that. I tried to explain that it was a joke, and that he was fine with it, but she just shook her head and said that “racism should never be excused.”

Now I feel really bad. I know Mike is okay with the nickname, because I’ve asked him, but now thinking about it, it may look like I’m really racist to other people. I also might be propagating racist stereotypes. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for getting mad at my friend for a Facebook post she made about my deceased dog?,"I do not consent to have this post shared anywhere. 



A while back when visiting my mom I (25F) told her our 11 year old family   dog (L) needs to be put down. He had trouble seeing, walking and eating so the kindest thing to do is to let him go. My mom was sad but agreed.

I asked my mom to help me with the clinics and such but she didn’t and it seemed like she wasn’t ready to let L go yet. At one point I scheduled an appointment without consulting her because L was in a bad shape and I couldn’t bear to see him struggle. She had a work day at the day of the apt, and she told me she couldn’t handle coming to the clinic anyways, which meant I would have to go alone. 

Yesterday my friend A (26F) asked me to hang out (tuesday) and I said I won’t have the energy as I’m saying my final goodbyes to L. A said she will come with me, she wants to say goodbye to L as well and I can’t do this by myself.

To be honest, I was relieved that she suggested it because the idea of me doing it alone was stressful. We agreed on the details and I went to bed.

This morning when I went to my mom’s to spend the last hours with L, I sent A a message. She read the message an hour before the apt and said she can’t come, she just woke up and can’t get a ride. (The clinic is 15 min away from where she lives by a bus.)

I went to the vet by myself and it was hard to be there alone. Even though I know it wasn’t about me, it was about L. 

When I got home, I distracted myself with social media but noticed A had made a FB post about L and how she missed him. I noticed it was posted 10 min later when the vet apt was scheduled to end. Her friends were giving her their condolences and she replied with hearts and thank yous, and to be honest, this angered me, she wasn’t even there for him! Why would she post anything on FB???

I asked her to take the post down and she got quite defensive at first, but later deleted it, and asked why she couldn’t keep the post up.

I told her that it felt a bit cold to promise to  be there for him and bail out on the last hour because she slept in and didn’t want to take a bus and then make a post about L without even consulting me first.

This caused a small argument between us and here’s where I think I may have been the AH.

I told her that she doesn’t have a right to collect pity points from her friends with MY pet. I asked her how many times I have been there for her, including one time when I drove 1,5 hours in a snow storm at night to visit her because she needed support but she can’t take one single bus ride to be there for me and L even though she promised. 
 
She said F You to me, and after that our conversation ended. I do feel really bad about what I said, especially since I could have been a lot nicer about it, but also I do feel I am kind of in the right.

AITA for getting upset at a Christian musician?,"I made musical friends online a few months ago. She saw me playing live and sent a message saying she liked my songs and asking if I'd listen to her. I was blown away by how talented this girl was. Just the most perfect, haunting voice. She's special. I was honored someone so talented liked my songs.

Fast forward a few months, she covers my song and posts it on youtube. I have a deep, raspy voice from a paralyzed vocal cord suffered a few years back so it was so beautiful for me personally to hear my song done by such a beautiful voice. People wrote me,, freaking out about it,, saying they were listening on repeat, crying, etc... and we knew we had something special. We talked about how our music felt cosmically connected, that the combination of my songs and her voice was perfect and felt right. Well, our song got heard by a producer who was worked with several famous acts (I verified this)and he volunteered to make an album with us. I got super excited about the prospect of this and told her about it. At first, she seemed really excited but then she asked if she could put a Christian song on the album. I'm an agnostic so the thought of that horrified me. I said no and could tell she was having reservations. 

The next day, she writes me saying that she's no longer interested in working on the project because ""it glorifies me, it doesn't glorify God"". I got super upset by this and told her that was a ridiculous reason to back out and that she's throwing away an amazing opportunity. I'm feeling kind of guilty about that now but we've complained to each other so many times about our lack of success in music so I was so sad she wouldn't do this with me. My best chance out of obscurity, working with her and this producer, gone.

"AITA for asking for my trousers back, that I gave my friend","Long time lurker, first time poster, so sorry for any grammar or format mistakes, I am on mobile.  This story is actually happening to my best friend, but she doesn’t have reddit so I told her I would recount her story for her. So I will tell it from her POV. 

This may seem like a petty dispute but I (17f) gave my friend (17f) a pair of trousers last month. Although they only cost like £20, I’m struggling to find my first job as I live in the countryside and don’t drive, and my mum works. So those jeans are fairly valuable to me. If it’s important, they’re a cool red colour with patterns going down the side. I like them but I didn’t wear them loads and my friend expressed an interest in them, and I thought she could wear them more and love them even more than me, so I told her she could have them.  

Now a month later (now) I saw online that she’s selling a bunch of clothes, including the trousers I only just gave her recently. I found this kind of insulting as I liked those trousers and thought she did too and thought it was kinda tactless of her, especially as she had them such short term. So I messaged her asking her if she didn’t like them anymore or they didn’t fit, if so, could I have them back. 

She said she was struggling to meet rent money (she lives with her boyfriend in an apartment, both out of contact with their parents) and so she was selling like half her wardrobe. This made me feel bad as I don’t want to take money from her rent funds, especially if she is struggling. But I also really like those trousers. She seems reluctant to give them back but hasn’t directly said no. My friends are pretty split on a judgement.

The other night we got into a fight. My dogs got into something and made a mess, and he saw it before me and got frustrated and yelled. I thought he was yelling at me (rather than just out of frustration), and got upset and scared and shut down (scared because that’s my general response to yelling). I ended up having a panic attack. We communicated about the whole thing afterward, and I told him that I thought I might have a form of autism because I sometimes have a great deal of trouble understanding tone.

To be clear, that is not the only reason why I suspect myself of being on the spectrum. I’ve thought for years that I think differently than other people, and whenever I look up symptoms of adult autism in women I can usually relate to about 75% of the signs. The more research I do, the more I think it’s a possibility. I haven’t been able to talk to my doctor about it since she’s been on leave for awhile, and I haven’t found a new GP yet, so I am not diagnosed. I also know that mental health issues are sort of “trendy” nowadays. I’m very glad that more people are getting help and awareness but know that there are people who say that they have X in order to get Y special treatment. I don’t want to be one of those people. 

I feel like I’m TA here because I used an undiagnosed mental disorder to try to get leeway in my relationship. If it’s just me not understanding then it’s my responsibility to work on communication, not blame it on something out of my control, right?",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting my friend to apologize and take down videos that were making people (specificly gay people) uncomfortable?,"So this happened and I need to know. I learned that my friend, Hope, was posting tiktok videos that were upsetting quite a few people and friends and she didn't want to take them down. I didn't fully understand what was wrong with them at the time but I now understand that they are harmful. I was an asshole (and I mean a HUGE asshole) and blew up at one friend, Leo, who had banned her from a server because of her actions. (He's gay and was very uncomfortable seeing the videos and many other people said that to Hope too.) But once I understood better, I apologized to Leo and said I would try to get Hope to take down the harmful videos. Hope hasn't replied to me yet and I pray that she will take down the videos so that all this fighting can stop.

I felt so bad after I blew up on Leo and apologized many times, not wanting to lose a friend. I said many bad things to him that I wish I didn't. I know I'm the asshole there, but I want to know if I'm wrong for asking Hope to remove the videos??

(The videos were huge dramatizations of a fem cat boy in a relationship with a masc wolf boy. I thought they were fine at first but now I see that they are harmful. I've told Hope this and I hope that she'll listen to me. If she replies or anything else happens, then I might update this.)

I want to keep my friend group together but Hope hasn't said anything to me yet and I don't know if I've upset her by asking her to take down the videos.

I know this post is short but I have to know. AITA?

EDIT: I'm so sorry, I forgot to add one thing. Not sure if it will change much but Leo had said it would be better if I confront Hope about this because he doesn't want to talk to her currently and since I'm closer to Hope, she might listen to me. They had gotten into a fight so I think they're pretty angry at each other. I finally got into contact with Hope so I'm trying to see if she'll listen to me. If she doesn't, then I might have to consider not being her friend.

EDIT #2 *jazz hands*: Hope actually said she would say sorry to Leo. She's starting to understand that she made a bunch of people uncomfortable and she wants to know how to change for the better. Right now, we're all taking a small break to breathe, maybe eat or drink something, and calm down. This now comes down to these two and I don't know if I can help past this point. I did tell them that if they start to feel upset or angry, then they should say so and take deep breaths but if it gets to be too much then they should leave or say that the conversation needs to continue on another day. Anger is an emotion that can cause a conversation to dive bomb into the group. Hopefully I'll have one more update and it will be a good one! I know I should stop fighting other people's battles but Hope had to put her pride down and I was the only one willing to tell her that. Even if the friendship is over, I want them to end on better terms than a fight.
I told Hope that if she ends it on a bad note then she might feel guilt in the future. I know how carrying around guilt feels like because I ruined a lot of friendships because I wasn't willing to change and now I can't apologize to most of them.",Asshole
AITA for not buying my husband cigarettes,"I, 27f, work a low income job. My husband, 29m, doesn’t work and hasn’t for 6 months. For our whole relationship I’ve been the main one earning income, except for when he does sporadic under the counter jobs and last year when he started working for his family member when I lost my job. I was unemployed for 6 months, but was receiving unemployment and watching our child while he worked. 

I didn’t mind being the only one working when he was watching our child, but our child is now in school. For the past six months he’s played video games night and day and barely contributed to household chores and child related responsibilities. He has started learning to cook more recently.

With that background out of the way, I have direct deposit and get my check deposited in the an account that we can both access and use. It is currently empty. He is out of cigarettes. I had $60 of cash I received as a present that I hid. I was keeping it in case of emergency like running out of food or gas. He tore apart the house yesterday looking for money to buy cigarettes. He found my hidden money I hadn’t told him about. He’s very irresponsible with money and I can’t save any if he knows about it so I lied and said I didn’t remember the money was there because I knew he would get mad if I didn’t buy him cigarettes. This was yesterday night. I told him he couldn’t use the money for cigarettes, but he had found enough change and a coupon to buy a pack. Before he returned the money to me, he used part of it to buy kratom even though I told him he couldn’t use my money. This morning I woke up and he makes me food and a drink. This is unusual. He then tells me he stayed up all night last night playing video games and that he’s out of cigarettes and asks me for my cash to buy another pack. I tell him no. He then says that I’m not doing anything with the money, didn’t even know it was there (because I was afraid to tell him I had cash all along and hadn’t bought him cigarettes), and get paid tomorrow. 
I tell him no, that I’m tired of every time I get money as a present that it ends up getting used on necessities and cigarettes for him (the previous month I gave him my birthday money to get medicine for our son, which he ended up not needing, so he used it to buy cigarettes without asking me), but that he uses his to get things for himself. He freaks out, starts yelling and calls me a bitch. We argue and I yell that I’m tired of him not contributing to our family. He says he’s leaving me and calls his dad to pick him up. His dad tells him to rethink things and he just texted me that he’s calmed down and is in his words, “a shithead”. 
Was I wrong to not give him money for cigarettes when he’s withdrawing? Am I being controlling by telling him he can’t buy certain things? What should I do?

Edit:
I also didn’t work for six months last year. I’m conflicted on judging him for not working for the same period of time. I know he struggles with depression and so do I, so I can understand how this can affect motivation. He keeps telling me that he’s looking for work or has jobs lined up, but it always seems to fall through. It feels wrong to leave, right when he’s starting making steps towards improvement.

I’m strongly considering leaving the relationship, but I can’t get ahold of my therapist to talk it out.",Not the A-hole
"AITA For telling my mom's friend ""you put our lives in danger""","On the road with my little brother and mom, my mom's friend tried to overtake the car front of us while there were 3 other cars lined up after that same car on a two lane road limited at 100 km/h (62 miles/h). The visibility was clear enough on the other lane (no cars for 200-300m ahead) and the pace was 100km/h before the overtaking. When trying to overtake, I felt he tried to overtake 2 or 3 cars at once but he could not do it since there was a car coming toward our direction and no gaps between the 4 cars. The first overtook car had to break to leave us the space to slide in then flashed us from behind. Then after the first car overtook, he tried to do the same for the 3 other cars when I told him I felt scared and unsafe that he put our lives in danger like that just to gain few seconds / minutes. After I told him, he stopped overtaking any cars the rest of the trip and drove 20 km/h below the speed limits and things have been awkward with some tension since then.

We were on holidays, not pressed by the time, and driving on the left side for the first time. I understand he had the control of the car (he has been driving for the last 10 years on the right side but lost few points because of speeding) but to my mind, he does not have the control on the other cars reactions which I was more scared of.

AITA because I didn’t want to keep giving my sister money?,"I’m 19F and I recently started a new temporary job a few weeks ago that I love. I finally heard back from this field trip instructor/teaching assistant job where I help at this school and they pay me and everybody $16/hour because of the travel and hard work.

I feel like I made the mistake of answering my sister (26F) when she asked how much I was making, and she’s been asking me for favors or wanting to be close lately. Her boyfriend (27M) and her make minimum wage which is a little above $8 per hour in our state.

So since money has been an issue for them, I guess that’s why she has been asking me for some in small amounts but it piles up. Like her $20 for groceries and $15 to buy takeout is going to pile up and I’ve probably given $100. It doesn’t bother me that much since I still have enough for savings, but I feel like all of a sudden my sister sees me as a money maker.

So I tried to back away or spend less, but she caught on. I don’t know if they’ll censor it but she called me the c word and a bitch for turning my back on family now that I’m doing better than them. 

It’s starting to get to me emotionally because she was never like this, and I know she’s not good with money either since she gives it to her boyfriend for spending so she doesn’t have much either. AITA really because I’ve tried to put a stop to giving her money?",Not the A-hole
AITA For being upset my when little brother deleted all of my data on my switch,"As the title says my little brother deleted all of my data on my switch.  This happened while I was in the shower.  When I got out and put on some clothes I decided that I would play some Pokémon, but when I turned on my switch it showed that I have 0 games.  I immediately got upset because I had 1,100+ hours spent playing on it and I knew that my brother had to have done something because he always wants to have my switch. 

Then I go to his room and ask him if he messed with my switch and he said, ""Yea.. I'm sorry.""  And then I said, ""Why did you do this."" showing the data less switch to him.  And he laughed saying, ""Get pranked""

I was upset and I left his room to go to my mom's room to tell her what happened and she was asking me why I was upset over some games then getting mad at me for being upset over games. 

I went back to his room and yelled at him for doing what he did and he got upset at me and said, ""What's the problem you can still play the games.""

So I left his room even more upset and with my dad coming into my room and after me telling him what happened he was on my side.

But I got grounded by my mom for still being upset over the switch.  And my brother said I was being an ass to him for being so upset.

"AITA: for calling my best friends writing 7 months ago""meh""","My bestfriend loves books, and words, and reading, and poetry. A lot of his identity is tied into being the intelligent, thoughtful, bookwork guy and currently he has aspirations of being a writer. Recently, he sent me the first page of a story he's working on and in my opinion it's well written. Here is what I replied with verbatim:

""You know, Every time you write something.  It gets more and more captivating. At first your writinf kinda meh, and then the prose started getting better, and then the characterization gets better, and in this one Im really intrigued in this character and the setting he's made for himself. I really enjoyed how the way you made the protag convey information, sorta clued me into the type of person he was. That he would take note of specifically how much of every type of trash was littering his floor is a really cool way of showing that he's both grubby but intriguingly astute and detailed oriented""

After i sent that text, my best friend responded with texts explaining that he thought that it was rude for me to say that his writing was ""meh"". That writing is his passion. That he's always expressed himself through books and words and things so when he found writing it felt like even if it was new to him it was something he'd always had.So when i say that  it's meh or ""whatever""  it makes him feel like the sum total of his aspirations is being reduced to a shrug emoji

I've always believed in my friends ability to be a writing. I genuinely think that he has the potential to be a great author and I don't want him to fall into complacency. I try to emphasize growth, challenge, progress and a part of that is that I reserve my compliments for when i sincerely like his writing. I feel like encouraging a self-identity of being a writer person will stifle his potential of becoming a great writer because he won't be critical in the areas that he needs to improve at.

AITA for not inviting my mother's partner to my wedding?,"My birth mom (47F) and I (27M) don't have a real relationship anymore. A lot of things happened growing up and it led to her only really reaching out to ask me for money or not at all. It's been very frustrating for me because I don't have enough hate in my heart to completely cut her out and I fall for a lot of her manipulative tactics. Boundaries are hard.

I'm getting married in a couple months and I went back and forth on whether or not to invite my mom to the wedding. I want it to be my olive branch because I do want my mom there but I'm not sure whether or not to commit to the invite. My fiancée (28F) is on my side no matter what I do, so it's really up to me.

I finally made the decision to invite her and before I sent out the invitations, my sister (24F) and my aunt (35F) both tried to have a conversation with my mom about our relationship. She was complaining that she hadn't received an invitation and she said that she wasn't coming to the wedding  regardless without her soon-to-be-husband. My sister and my aunt both yelled at my mom and they got into a fight about it. My aunt is no longer talking to my mom.

The thing is, this invite is for her only. I have no interest in whoever this guy is. I've never met him and I don't feel like introducing myself to anyone new on my wedding day. Plus, I want this to be a chance for me and her to rebuild our relationship and move forward. I feel like that's not possible considering how she is with men. She's likely to pay more attention to her relationship with him than her relationship with me.

I'm really struggling with this. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing or not by excluding him. They are going to be married but I honestly do not care about their relationship at all.

AITA for benching a kid for the Grand final after he abused a referee,"Hi Reddit. So I'm the coach of a junior football (Aussie rules) team here in Australia, the boys I coach are Under-17s, so basically 16YO boys. This incident occurred last year, but it came up in conversation today and I was wondering what this thread would think.

&#x200B;

So in the semi-final last year one of our best players suddenly got sent off - we didn't initially understand why and the player when he came off told us it was because he'd asked the umpire to ""umpire fairly"". I said it was unlikely the umpire sent him off for this, but he insisted that's all he said - he continued insisting on this for multiple hours after the match.

&#x200B;

When the report came through the next day the umpire alleged he'd said ""you are so f\*\*\*ing biased"" to the umpire - my son then confirmed to me this was what he had indeed said - the kid had been lying. We as a club pled guilty to this offence and the child received a warning from the league but no suspension

&#x200B;

HOWEVER, it is our club's policy to suspend a player for a game if they abuse an umpired. I, as the coach, DO have the power to overrule this tho.  But I chose not too, and imposed the standard 1-game suspension, despite that one game being the Grand final.

&#x200B;

The child's mother then wrote me an impassioned email explaining that this game ""was so important"" to her son and that he'd been crying when he found out he was suspended and was very remorseful over his actions.

&#x200B;

I wrote back saying I was not going to waive the suspension for 3 reasons.

&#x200B;

1. I'm a big believer in the importance of respecting umpires - it's really important to me, we have no game without them and it's never acceptable to abuse anyone doing their job to the best of their abilities. I wanted to set an example to the team that this behaviour WOULD NOT be tolerated and do what little I can to improve their treatment in our sport
2. He had also lied to me for hours after the match, which suggested to me he initially had no remorse - doing something in the heat of a game is one thing, but still lying after the match is another.
3. Getting sent off seriously harms the team, as they play a man down. We nearly lost the semi purely because of going a man down (we were up by 20 points when he was sent off, hung on for a 1 point win). I couldn't afford to risk the team's chances in the chance this behaviour was repeated.

So - that was my rationale, a mix of moral and strategic considerations. So Reddit, was this fair, or am I the AH for giving too harsh of a penalty?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to join in with works nights out?,"So for a while I didn't drink at all, however lately I have enjoyed having a glass or two of beer or wine with my wife sometimes sat in the garden.
I casually mentioned this at work, and then it began ""oh fantastic you can join the works night out in x amount of time"".
One, works nights out usually means they start at midday and end when the last person has dropped from being totally inebriated, I absolutely cannot stand being drunk.

Two, I like to keep work and outside life strictly separate, I have a couple of people I work with who are on my wavelength that I chat to outside of work, and being brutally honest, I would rather not see some colleagues on a personal outside of work setting at all.

So I said no I won't as their idea of a night out and mine are very entity's but thanks for the offer, cue some of them calling me boring, sad etc and that its a team building exercise......really.
Some of these colleagues cannot understand that I like to keep work and home separate and that I have a life outside of work that doesn't involve me being in their pockets end of the day I spend most of my week with at work.

"WIBTA if I continue living in his in-law's house, even though I don't want to be friends with him, AND he is moving back into the house too?","I grew up with my friend Suzanne. I was known as the raggedy lost girl who hung around everyone else's house. My parents were both abusive and my mom had serious untreated mental health problems so I just tried to stay away from them. Suzanne's parents liked me because I was the ultimate people pleaser and did anything to be liked so that other families would let me hang out there. I would actually do things like clean Suzanne's entire room every time I came over. I was also extremely shy and timid and young for my age so parents saw me as a ""good girl"" / good influence.

Eventually we all went to college and I ended up in a city near Suzanne so we hung out a lot. Eventually Suzanne got together with ""Bill.""

Bill is one of those loud guys who always has an opinion on everything and everyone. Bill alienated all of Suzanne's other friends because he'd do things like insist to be included on girl's nights and spent the whole time awkwardly hitting on people, giving ""Advice"" on their looks, and telling them ""why they were single."" But then he was extremely ""hurt and upset"" when nobody liked him.

I tried really hard to be friends with Bill, but Bill is one of those people who is never happy, thinks the whole world is against him, and his life is everyone else's fault. Of course he blames the people closest to him. So when I was trying to be his friend, he blamed / attacked me for many things in his life that weren't my fault. So I distanced myself from him. He ""confronted"" me about this years later and told me I was a hurtful and bad friend. So I distanced myself even more. But stayed friends with Suzanne.

Because of my rough start in life and genetic propensity for mental illness I ended up in a bad position, struggling to stay on top of my student loans and couldn't afford any healthcare. I never liked to ask anyone for help but eventually had a nervous breakdown. Suzanne called me and said her parents asked how I was doing and she told them of my nervous breakdown. Her parents wanted me to move in with them and they would take care of me. This was humiliating at the age of 31 being independent since my teens but I accepted it.

When I moved in with them, they encouraged me to start a Master's program so I could make more money, and said I could live with them the whole time. I went for it and now have 6 months left in the program.

Since then Suzanne and Bill decided to have a baby even though Bill has refused to work for 5 years. He said he'd do most of the baby work, but now that the baby is here, he refuses to. Suzanne needs help badly so her mom said to move in here too and she would help.

The problem is I don't want to be friends with Bill even though I live here. Just want to finish my Masters and GTFO. Can I stay distanced from him, though Bill says my distance is ""hurtful and mean""?",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking my husband to speak louder because we're facing away from each other with an object between us?,"
Our living room is about 25 feet wide, and the TV is on one side, his computer is on the other. There's a couch in the middle-ish. I sit about 7 feet away from him, but we're not facing each other and there's a couch back between us. I have trouble sitting at a computer desk due to some health issues, so I game on a laptop from the couch, often using the TV as the monitor. 

He speaks, constantly, at a quiet indoor voice that one might use once it's ""gearing down time"" even if it's 4PM. I can't hear him, and I've asked him multiple times to please be mindful that I can't hear him and speak at a normal indoor volume, or perhaps slightly more. 

Recently he got inordinately upset because I didn't hear him ask me if I wanted to do something (I was playing a game at the time and literally didn't hear him speaking quietly), and then blew up about me just not listening to him. I tried to explain that I've said it before, but I genuinely can't hear him. It's OK to speak at a slightly elevated volume (and isn't that hard) if you need to ask a question or tell someone something when you need to be louder for them to hear. 

Apparently this is a ""me problem"" and I need to ""listen better."" I'm not that kind of gamer, though, I don't get wrapped up and can't hear, whenever he's sitting next to me I respond no matter what's going on in game. 

Here's where I might be TA, though. I told him that if he doesn't feel like making himself audible to me, then he can just answer whatever question he has for himself and leave me out of it. I can't be arsed to be chastised for not hearing him when we're not even facing each other, and if his request is that important he should actually make sure I can hear him and not just pretend I'm ignoring him. 

Unfortunately now he's acting like I'm asking him to scream in our house (I'm asking him to speak a little louder, not yell), and that he's just going to not talk until he feels like sitting on the couch.

AITA? Work friend thinks I betrayed her trust,"My work friend told me about a problem at the office today.  It was not anything that she was directly involved in, just a trend she had noticed that I knew would be an issue if it continued.  Moreover, had it continued she could have gotten grief from our bosses about not doing anything about it.

Details if useful: a visiting team from another office has been camping out in the private offices in our group all week - offices that are full of confidential client info (we work in M&A).  They have been going as far as to plug laptops into docking stations, and working in these offices for hours.  They’re messy too, leaving food debris in  common areas, so I don’t expect they’re being respectful in these offices either.  Every one of our managing directors would be angry to discover some random person making themselves at home in their personal space, and a couple of them would likely come at my friend asking who these fools are and who told them they could squat there and why she didn’t tell them to bugger off.

I’ve been at the company for 15 years; she’s been there 2.  I outrank her, in fact she is technically my assistant.  I did her job for years and know the team and their expectations.   I now work in operations and used to be the office manager.  Solving problems like this is well within my skill set and purview. 

My friend made it clear that she had no intention of doing anything about this except be annoyed.  I told her I would mention the trend to our lead MD and get his blessing to evict these squatters (I knew he would want this 100% but also wanted to cover our asses if he saw something amiss the next time he’s in), and also told her that I would shoot a note to the admin of this visiting group asking her to book some conference rooms if they need office space.

Ava has an autoimmune disease and Down's Syndrome and is about to start kindergarten. The special needs program at our public school district is horrible. I've heard horror stories from parents and teachers, so my husband and I decided sending Ava to public school isn't an option. 

There's a private school for kids like her not far from our house and it's perfect. They have very small class sizes, an amazing curriculum, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and nurses (this is important for us because Ava needs to be given shots and medicine through her picc line during school hours).

I'm a SAHM and my husband doesn't make enough to support all of us and send her to that school so we approached Jonathan and Madeline and told them that we're either going to need them to pay rent, utilities, and groceries because we can't afford to support them and pay for Ava's new school or they'll need to move out so we can sell our house and move into something smaller. 

Madeline agreed and is looking for apartments but Jonathan yelled at us for threatening to kick him out and for making him pay rent instead of me getting a job (I will be working part time once Ava goes to school).

I told her I thought it was a bad idea because we'd be splitting up the relatives and people won't want to travel to the same city for weddings 2 weeks apart. However, I said I would come.

Mar 2020: 2 wks out from our wedding, due to COVID, we decide to cancel and move to Sep '20. Two weeks later, she canceled hers and rescheduled for Sept 2020 - **2 weeks after our** ***new*** **wedding date**. Ok, I'll come, maybe dates were hard to get.

Sept '20: COVID is in full swing. We canceled our wedding again because we think it's not safe and *rescheduled for Sept 2021*. My sister holds her wedding (church ceremony and a wedding reception in a beach house with a buffet with 50+ people). We're nervous, but we attend. My sis made her SIL a bridesmaid and makes me & bro ushers.

Since we've planned our September '21 wedding, she's decided she will have a ***2nd*** **""post-COVID"" wedding** with more people in September '21, **3 weeks after our date, same city.**

I am an MTF trans woman, I was still ""in the closet"" and presenting male (about 6 months on hormones) at the time of her Sep '20 wedding. I was ready to come out but chose not to mention it on this trip so as not to take away focus. I waited until a zoom a month later. I have updated name, pronouns, and have been publicly female since then.

My younger sister is also having a wedding and made me a bridesmaid. My fiancée and I decided not to really have any bridal parties but I asked both sisters, niece \[older sister's daughter\], and a friend to essentially be bridesmaids and get ready with me in my bridal suite. My brother is the man of honor. Unprompted, my sister told me, ""oh I'm not really having bridesmaids."" However, her wedding site has a list of groomsmen and bridesmaids and - lo and behold - me, with updated name & pic as an **usher**.  I simply said, ""that's ok, I won't be able to attend.""

Context: *I have facial feminization surgery that I had to schedule many months in advance. It is 10 days before her 2nd wedding and 2 weeks after mine. My fiancée and I also have 5 more weddings to go to this year including my younger sister's.*

My parents and my sister are upset and are saying I should move my surgery (hard) and come to the wedding.

So, AITA if I don't go to my sister's 2nd wedding?

**Update:** Just RSVP'd no on her site.  Had to use my deadname to do it.  Thanks sis!",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to go to my moms because she has my pathological liar cousins always there?,"So background, 2009 one of my uncles has a daughter(my cousin we’ll call her A) as soon as she was born it was like my entire family changed but I’ll say positively. She became my favorite cousin mostly because she was a baby and I was 11(I’m 23F). From her birth until she was 6 I was always around, I’d babysit her, I’d take her places, Id get her stuff. Well anyways as I got older her mom wanted to distance her from me bc she claims I am/was a bad influence because I used to wear chokers as a teenager and didn’t know what I wanted to do after high school. So I pretty much stopped seeing here as much and got over it stopped trying because I’m not going to consistently argue with someone about their kid.

Fast forward my mom and my grandma live together and my cousins is always there. She’s now a pathological liar always lying and making up stories except sometimes these stories get other people to problems or cause other people to have problems in the family. For example claiming something is hers(when it’s something my mom has got for me clearly an adult) and then crying when confronted about it. At first I would just let it go and focus on spending time with my mom but we could literally be watching a movie and she’ll interrupt to tell a lie or make up a story to get our attention. Last week my mom told her to change bc her dad was coming to pick her up and she acted like my mom wasn’t talking to her so I told her what my mom said again and she told me that my mom said to do that later I told her no she didn’t I literally just heard her and she kept insisting that my mom said later, swearing to God, and trying to change the subject and call me a liar. I asked my mom  that she said and she repeated that A needs to change because her dad is coming. A refused to admit she was lying and began to cry saying to telling people shes a liar(i only told my mom)

I told my mom I’m not coming over while A is there because I’m uncomfortable around kids that are always lying. My mom told my sister and now both of them are consistently telling me that I’m over reacting, that she’s a kid and kids go through phases, that she(A) loves me and that we used to be super close and I’m being a bad daughter and cousin for not wanting to be around.

AITA for not wanting to be around a kid that’s always lying",Not the A-hole
AITA for meddling in a relationship,"I (22M) have been friends with this woman (23) my whole life. We were neighbour's and went to school together. I'm now in the same line of work as her dad as he was one of my college professors and have always been close with her family. We used to tell people we were cousins when we were young cause they always joked we were dating. I consider her family. 

We have both had relationships and have respected each others partners and boundaries, like no solo hangs, sleepovers or late movies/drinks if our partners weren't there, and easy on the snaps and texting/phone calls. She has never been a topic of an argument in any of my relationships and as far as I know I wasn't an issue with  her ex. 

She's been dating her current boyfriend for about 3 years now and we have gotten along great. He's been pretty cool and we have some things in common. We've hung out countless times and I have never noticed anything bad until recently.

We had a small camping get together with about 10 people. I noticed everytime she sat down beside me and started talking, her boyfriend would get up and join the conversation, within 30 seconds. He would abandon beerpong by subbing people in, he completely abandoned the bbq one time and we had to put out a small hotdog fire. Then, whenever she got up to do anything he would switch seats and sit beside me. She would come back and sit somewhere else. I brushed it off the first time but since we were playing games and moving a lot he did it every time we sat beside each other, within seconds of her getting up. We weren't talking to each other evertime either so it wasn't a natural ""We're talking so ill move closer"" type thing. 
She even asked for her chair back a couple times and he refused. He would also make crude sexual comments about her and she was constantly asking him to stop. She very obviously didn't find them funny but he would laugh and keep the joke going. 

We got a minute alone and I mentioned that he didn't seem to respect her boundaries and listen when she asks him to stop something that makes her uncomfortable. I also mentioned the chair thing and she said he always did that when she was sitting next to a guy. I asked her if she's OK being with a guy who doesn't seem to respect her boundaries. She told me it was none of my business. I apologized profusely and told her I didn't mean to over step. I just wanted to make sure she was OK. She seemed to accept and we moved on. I've now heard from a mutual friend that they have been fighting constantly and he's saying with a friend. I told the mutual friend what I said and she thought I had overstepped and it was probably my fault that they're fighting. This was not my intention and I've messaged her a couple times asking if she wanted to grab a coffee and she hasn't answered. So AITA?


Tldr I noticed some red flags in my friends relationship and mentioned it. Now they're fighting and I believe it's my fault",Not the A-hole
AITA For being hyperfocused on going on a trip I've been planning for months?,"This all started when I (F20) and my friend from another state (F21) got our first jobs. We made an agreement that when we get a bit of money saved up, we would get everything in place to see each other and have a week to be kids for a bit before work gets hectic. Everything was going good, I got 3 checks in and I've been talking to my family and friends about the trip and asking for help planning everything for around 3 months now. 

This is where things go sour.

My bank has been running into issues with my debit card, currently I don't have one and the one they sent out to me in the mail is almost 5 days late. Due to the inability to pay for my way out there, I turned to my sister who has a very very good paying job: $27 an hour compared to my $10 an hour. I told her I'd pay her back in full, no matter the price  At this point, things have been being shot down left and right. My siblings both said no to driving me to the nearest bus station to catch a ride. Only 1hr away and before any of them had work. My sister refused because the last trip I took also involved this bus station, and on the way to pick me up from the bus, she got into a car accident where a taxi hit her vehicle in the side. According to her, it's my fault because if I hadn't gone on my trip, she wouldn't have been picking me up and gotten in the accident.

My brother told me that he's not ever going to drive me to the nearest city, saying he just doesn't want to. He is completely willing to drive 6 hours across states but doesn't want to take me because he's not going anywhere near the city.

At this point, on the morning of the trip, my Lyft never showed, and I had to cancel my bus ticket. My parents who already didn't want me to go because my friend and I are both bisexual and they say she's my my girlfriend and I'm just wanting to go to have sex, said that the Lyft never showing up was my sign that they were right and that I can't go on the trip.

I admit I went off the deep end here. I tried working with my sister to get a taxi, a ride from a coworker, and even a bus TO my bus, but in the end she gave up and sided with my parents. I've been snippy and angry and frankly downright rude ever since, trying to find a way to see her even if I have to pay out of pocket for it. My parents say I'm obsessed with the trip (no argument there) and that proves I shouldn't go because I'm up to no good. I told them that they're paranoid, and just because they think I'm up to no good is no excuse to block everything I try to propose to make this trip work, because they have no proof and are being paranoid.

AITA for not listening to them, even though I still live with them, and obsessively trying to make this trip work? I think I am TA but at this point, I'm too furious to stop.",Asshole
AITA if I don't tell my family I'm coming home?,"By family, grandparents. I have around 10 of them. All of them demand time and visits, and to make sure that their own time and visits exceed the time given to other grandparents. I have not seen my actual family  (parents/siblings) since Dec 2019 due to circumstances you can probably guess at. Due to the younger kids not being able to be v@xxed yet, my parents, siblings, and I have agreed that while it sucks, we can see each other spring/summer 2022. (Baby bro will be 2 by then).

Since earlier this year, I have been in basic training and tech school. Although it sucks, I'm going to stop by really quick to get my stuff out of storage before reporting to my first duty station. Essentially driving 30+ hours to get my stuff, wave through the window at my parents/sibs, and leave the state again within a day. No other stops in my home state.

My worry is, since I was a kid, most of these grandparents have been emotionally and mentally abusive to me and my parents (especially my mom). During 2020 they would often force me to come over, pretending they needed help with something, refusing to m@sk, and then reminding me often that my parents were stupid for not letting anyone visit/exp0se themselves. They called my mom crazy, to my face, multiple times (even outside of 2020). Before 2020 the demands were always more time spent with them, even if we didn't have the time or energy to give it to them, amongst other things they should not have been asking for and insane amounts of guilt trips if we didn't deliver. They're going to discover at some point that I WAS back in my home state, but did not visit them as they have been demanding since I have left for basic almost 6 months ago. There's just too many of them, they're too spaced out distance wise, and there's not enough time between leaving tech and reporting to make them all happy. However, once they find out, it will start WW3 - and I'm worried my parents will take the brunt of it as I will once again be out of state and busy, but my parents easy targets.

This is extremely over-simplified, but there has already been 1-2 fights between my parents and grandparents regarding visitations this year alone, and I'm worried this will spark another.

Basically, AITA if I ignore them and sneak around and out, despite the fall out that will happen?

AITA for letting my dog help me babysit?," Ok so here is the situation. I live in a multi family house and my family shares the kitchen, which is upstairs, with another family. Our families naturally became family friends. I (19M) have a 16 year old poodle, who lets call Alexander (not real name his name is too recognizable). Alexander has literally never had any problems with anyone, I've spend everyday with him his entire life with the exception of the first few weeks of his life, but pretty much everyday since I was 3, and I consider him a brother pretty much. I have 2 siblings significantly younger than me who I had to baby sit before they got old enough, and if I needed to go in the kitchen while I was on babysitting duty, I told Alexander to stay with them and he would let me know if my siblings needed anything by calling me down with his barks. I'm pretty sure my parents have also used Alexander in the same way to help watch my siblings while they needed to do something else in the house.

Anyway so the family that has been living in the same house as us for about 2 years now last week asked me to babysit their actual baby one night. They asked me because my parents and siblings had gone and visited our cousins in another state (I stayed bc I am taking summer classes). Anyway they trust me and know that I have experience with my siblings. I just had to watch the sleeping baby they already put to bed in his crib while they went on date night. As I am watching TV and monitoring the baby, I realized I didn't have dinner yet and neither did Alexander. So like I literally always did with my siblings, I had Alexander (who was already familiar with the baby) sit on the couch next to their baby's crib, and told him to stay there. I cook some dinner for Alexander and me, come back down eat, no problems.

My neighbor comes home and asks how everything went. I explain that the baby was asleep the whole time, everything went well. And I mention how Alexander even helped me out with the babysitting. They ask what I mean and I explain to them what happened, reassuring them I've done the same and my parents have done the same with my siblings and Alexander. They flip out on me, saying how could I leave their kid with a dog and a bunch of other things like that. They are hispanic and I'm pretty sure they even called Alexander a monster in spanish thinking I would not understand, which is extremely rude. They literally would not listen to reason as I tried to explain that I've known him for 16 years, he has never been aggressive to anyone, ect, they wouldnt let me say anything. Since this happened they have been quite rude to me when I see them in passing, and I have not apologized because I don't think I did anything wrong considering I know for a FACT, beyond any doubt that Alexander wouldn't hurt their baby or a fly that landed on the crib.

TLDR: Neighbors asked to babysit their baby in a crib as it slept at night, and I left the baby with my extremely trustworthy dog as I made dinner upstairs.",Asshole

"AITA for saying ""I don't know"" instead of something that would cause issues with my MIL?","
My mother in law asks a lot of questions that have an implied right and wrong answer, like ""when are you having kids"" and ""how much are you going to church""

My husband usually says what she wants to hear but kinda noncommittal. I've generally been honest which gets her upset with me, and my husband thinks I could be a bit more delicate.

So when I feel like one of those conversations is coming on, I have started saying that I didn't know myself or hadn't decided yet.

Like on the topic of me traveling alone this summer: I dunno how long I'll be traveling for, I dunno where I'll go exactly, I'll figure it out

Or on the topic of kids: Oh I dunno; might as well let nature take it's course, well see

Or on the topic of my job: Oh maybe I'll keep this job or maybe I'll hop to another, I'll see how it goes.

On the topic of being a homemaker: Yeah maybe I'll learn to cook or maybe we can get one of those recipe boxes delivered, we'll figure it out

Etc... Whenever it's a tricky conversation, I say that I don't know yet. And honestly, for a lot of these, I really don't know. Like I'm traveling but I honestly am keeping plans loose. I love my job but I'm not so attached I wouldn't leave if circumstances changed. I am not trying to have kids but who knows how I'd feel if we got pregnant with a miracle baby lol

My husband was fine with this at first but now his mom is getting frustrated at me for being so aimless in life. She feels like he married an apathetic layabout who won't learn to do anything or grow up

I feel like being honest would have just been easier...

AITA for pointing out friends hypocrisy?,"Em(24f) and I(23f) have been friends for years. Em met Iz(27f) through work and they became fast friends. I used to travel up to almost every weekend, so I also became friends with Iz, though not as close as I am with Em. 

Last year, Em started seeing this guy(Q). Em is a self proclaimed romantic, and was committed almost immediately. Q was clearly not a romantic but did seem to really like her. As soon as they started hanging out, all conversations Em and I had somehow looped to Q. Talking about family? She’s describing Q’s. About flying home? She wants Q to come on her next visit. About music? This is what Q thinks of that genre. Though this did get annoying, I know that people get excited in new relationships and want to gush, so I just went with it and tuned it out if it was too much. Fast forward, things didn't work out between Em and Q. 

Fast forward again, both Em and Iz are “seeing” guys. They started talking around the same time, but Em and “X” have been making slow progress because he’s a PHD student with a very demanding course list and can’t meet up every week. Em still talks about X constantly. Iz sees “J” very often. They have dates at least once a week, they’ve been on multiple trips together. They haven't officially said they’re dating, but they are exclusive and she doesn’t correct me when I call J her boyfriend. Em cannot stand when Iz talks about J. Anytime they hang out I’m guaranteed to get a call afterwards complaining about how Iz wouldn’t shut up about J, how it’s annoying, and how she wasn’t taking Em’s feelings or situation into account at all. Em thinks Iz is trying to rub it in. I’ve asked and the things she says Iz talks about are basically all the things Em used to go on about with Q. I’ve tried telling her to be honest with Iz that she’d rather not hear about their relationship, but Em insists she shouldn’t have to, and that it would make her feel like she was losing to Iz if she admitted it bothered her. 

Last night I got another call, Em ready to complain again, and I kind of snapped. I told her she was being unfair for always wanting to gush about her guy, but whining when a friend wanted to do the same. I told her I was fine to listen to HER gush about the men in her life, but didn’t want to hear her ragging on Iz for doing the Exact Same, unless she was also going to stop talking about men. That it was clear she was upset and jealous that Iz had the relationship Em wanted. 

Well, Em is pissed and saying I yelled at her when she was already upset, that I should try to see from her point of view and how Iz talking about J makes her feel, when she “can’t seem to keep any guy interested in her” (her words, not mine). 

I can see how I might be TA here. Em is my bestfriend, so I think she expects I’d take her side, as Iz is a friend but not a close one. But I felt the need to stand up for Iz, who didn’t deserve the railing she was getting behind her back. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for being Selfish ?,"Aside from the title, I’ve been called selfish by family members including my father and step mother all the time.

Recently my step mother likes to tell everyone she knows about the fact that I have no friends, that I’m too selfish, and I don’t have emotions. Leading up til today, I had only one AirPod in, following her rules just in case she calls one of us (my brother and I.) I heard distinct yelling at first thinking she had called one of us, so I turned my volume down but didn’t hear anything for about two minutes so I put them back in thinking that she on the phone. Turns out the whole time she had called for me and asked me for my laptop. So I agreed but I had to leave my game and decided to just leave and not save it so I could just give it to her faster. Seconds later she barges into my room snatches my laptop and proceeds to yell at me and call me selfish, even going lengths to blame her own son for being sneaky and hiding her laptop charger (which he would never do)complaining that none of this would happen if I wasn’t selfish and that her laptop was charged.

They finally showed up close to midnight. I was fuming because I expect at least a text saying they are running late. I kind of lost it because this isn’t the first time this happened, where he stays out late and doesn’t let me know and it annoys me. I confronted my bf and asked why he couldn’t take 2 seconds out of his day to keep me updated and he goes on about the internet being down at his shop and he had work conflicts he had to take care of. Here’s where I might be the ahole. i wouldn’t accept his “excuses” and said that he was inconsiderate for not keeping me in the loop and he insists that I’m over reacting and his solution is that he’ll never bring our kid to work with him again.

Now all the other brothers are mad because my father shouldn’t have allowed me to get the money and that money should have been used to help that family member out now.

Unfortunately she had ptsd from another medical where she was not medically put to sleep during the procedure. This gave my parents major guilt and didn’t want to make her life anymore difficult.

I have dealt with severe depression and anxiety my whole life and was just offered medical help to treat this and my father refused the help without talking to me about it. I have been waiting to  be seen to for 5 years so for him to refuse me getting the help I need was a complete slap in the face. When I asked him about it he told me that I was just asking for attention and I need to get over things from the past. Just to be clear one to the main reasons for my mental health issues is my fathers infidelity to my mother since I was 7 years old and have kept this a secret from my sisters for years. Just recently my sister Amy was told that she and our family will have to do family therapy and my father was the first one to agree saying: “she’s actually depressed she’s not faking therefore we’re all going to do this for her.” It broke my heart and i yelled at my dad for how he treats us so differently and he claims that i just desperately want attention.

One time when my parents helped me and my partner move my partner's stuff from their abusive old landlord to my place, I was intending to go back to my old home, but refrained when my partner had a meltdown due to PTSD and I decided to make sure they were safe. My brother sent me an abusive text insulting me and my partner.

Then one time when we had laundry issues and I had to ask my parents' help again, my brother once again sent me a very abusive text because apparently I'd ""ruined things"" and he ""needed the laundry before work tomorrow"".

Earlier this month I finally visited home and was ready to do stuff with my brother, but he was angry when he found out I was only staying for the day and not for the night. I do feel asshole-ish for not staying the night when he wanted to do stuff with me, but I didn't feel comfortable given everything else I mentioned above. He called me a snake, a monster and how I've ""changed"". He then threatened to cut up my partner's clothes should my parents ever do their laundry again. (My brother has never approved of my partner, telling me they're not allowed in the family home, and can't ever visit for Christmas.)

This was the final straw. Afterwards, I decided I'm not going to do anything with him unless he realises how entitled and selfish he was behaving, especially after how he talks about my partner. However, last weekend my dad visited. He told me how my brother complains to him that I never talk or get in touch with him. I tried telling my dad my reasons, and my dad understood, but tries to tell me to ""at least send him a message"" or ""give him a call"". I'm especially worried about how I might look like the asshole if I come ""home"" for Christmas but don't do anything with him.

My dad's a great parent, but I'm not sure I can do this. And now I'm feeling a bit asshole-ish for not even telling my brother I wouldn't keep in touch. And my dad seems to think I should at least try to get along. Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for being mad at my friends for leaving me?,"So over quarantine I had made a handful of friends on amino, we grew to know eachother and even made plans to move in together, meet eachother etc.

Soon enough- I got a girlfriend and she became part of the friend group. The friend group's humor was basically just being mean to eachother, but when my girlfriend (lets call her A for now) made the same jokes, they got mad at her and went way over the line, which I was trying to stop.

We all started being a bit more nice toward eachother again, even though they did act mean toward A multiple times, I always tried to talk to them, and one time, they told me that A was gaslighting and manipulating me, which is a trigger for me as I was gaslighted in the past.

One day, they went away and moved, when I asked why, they said its cause of A and that I didn't stop her even though I had tried and she tried too, they said it was my fault too, being her s/o, which generally passed me off.

When I stopped arguing with them, they kept boasting and shouting about how they were 'finally free from us' etc, despite them being about 2 years older. AITA for still being mad and not moving on?",Asshole
WIBTA If I Outed my Mom's Best Friend for being Cruel to her Daughter?,"Note: All names have been changed.

&#x200B;

My Mom is best friends with my BFF's Mom, Susan, but I've become increasingly uncomfortable with our Moms' friendship.

&#x200B;

In the past month or two BFF has told me about how toxic her home life is, where Susan is constantly making negative comments on BFF's appearance, fat-shaming BFF, and leaving BFF to take care of her 3 other siblings. BFF constantly has to drive her siblings to their activities, has to cook for the family, is the only one to take care of the dogs, washes the dishes, and is then berated for ""not doing enough"", even though she has a part-time job as well.

&#x200B;

Susan is constantly yelling at BFF for the smallest things, and always goes into BFF's room and steals her stuff. BFF has tried asking Susan to respect her boundaries, but just to spite her Susan will push those boundaries more. For example, when BFF was doing dishes and Susan was in her personal space, when BFF asked Susan to scooch a little bit away, Susan intentionally moved closer.

&#x200B;

There have also been times where Susan called BFF a (word for someone who is paid for passionate hugging) for wearing a dress that was less than an inch above her knees (as a swimsuit cover-up), and other times where Susan intentionally brings up BFF's deceased Grandmother and how disappointed the Grandmother would have been in her. BFF was so incredibly close to her Grandmother, and seeing as she died recently, is still grieving the loss. To make matters worse, Susan never apologized for anything.

&#x200B;

BFF is getting poor sleep, occasionally loses the will the eat, and has had multiple panic attacks due to her treatment. Susan has even stopped letting BFF see her friends, claiming them as ""Bad Influences"", and I'm so scared of BFF retreating even further into herself. She isn't even allowed to pick up a job of her choice, and was forced to work at Susan's office, where people constantly compare the two of them and Susan called BFF a ""Little Me"". It makes BFF want to throw up.

&#x200B;

BFF has tried telling Susan about her mental problems, but Susan dismisses them and says that ""It's all in \[BFF's\] head"", and that BFF ""has just been taking things wrong"". BFF is terrified that she's the one in the wrong and is blowing things out of proportion. Although I haven't witnessed the scenes BFF has described, I believe and support BFF one hundred percent, and I am furious on her behalf.

&#x200B;

I don't want to break up my Mom's friendship, especially seeing as she has so few, but I hate the idea of her staying friends with Susan, and I'm so worried about BFF. There's also the possibility that my Mom won't believe me, and that I'll be banned from spending time with BFF. Would it be cruel of me to tell my Mom what BFF has told me?",Not the A-hole
AITA for calling BIL and SIL names & making pregnant SIL cry?,"I (26F) and fiance H (26M) generally are alright with his brother BIL (27M) and his wife SIL (28F). H and I are an interracial/international couple. We used to live in the same city as BIL&SIL, but due to c\*vid, we moved in with his parents about 3 hours away. We both work part time in addition to doing our masters and pay rent & bills here. 

Ever since first meeting SIL, she has always been passive aggressive and arguably r\*cist towards me. She used to say things to me like ""Don't you think having mixed race children is wrong"", ""Why do you have gay friends when you're Christian"" (she's religious & anti LGBTQ, but I personally think religion should be personal), ""Don't your people eat dog"" etc. BIL has not said anything as explicitly as SIL, but he does make snide comments about me wanting \*the equivalent of\* a green card (we don't live in the US) and living off my rich asian parents and that I can just ask my dad to buy me things.

I always stand up for myself but BIL&SIL's responses were usually that she was joking/I'm too sensitive/maybe I misunderstood cuz English isn't my first language. H always defends me but BIL will then complain to their mother, and twist things to say that they were joking/I'm overly sensitive, or falsely accusing me of saying things to upset SIL. 

BIL is a massive mama's boy and calls his and H's mom everyday. He also always asks her to solve problems for him e.g. when he and SIL got into an argument, she didn't want to do his laundry, so he made his mom drive 3 hours to do it for him. SIL is very entitled, an only child and is used to getting things her way. 

SIL is currently pregnant. There was recently a c\*vid-safe family BBQ with H's family. During it, BIL&SIL started making comments to H&I, saying things like we're leeching off of H's parents and am I sad there's no dog meat. Then, BIL said I should just ask my dad to buy a place for us cuz ""aren't all asians rich anyway"". They kept going on until I just physically walked away. I didn't want to make a scene. I went to a corner with H, upset, and said something like ""they're r\*cist assholes"" and ""at least I don't run to my mom and dad every time I have something to complain about"". I genuinely didn't know that BIL&SIL had followed us from behind and overheard what I said. 

SIL made a big deal about it and burst into tears calling me mean. BIL yelled at me for making his pregnant wife cry and told his parents ""that's why she (me) doesnt belong in the family"". The BBQ ended on a really awkward note. They also told her family and their friends (who weren't at the BBQ) and they are calling me an asshole.

We explained our side of the story to H's parents, but things are a little awkward as BIL still calls everyday and demands I apologise to them. No one has asked me to, but I think that if I did, it might ease things. 

Despite this, I'm still upset and can't shake off their words as 1) I did call them r\*cist & immature, and 2) I made a pregnant woman cry. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to get my mom chocolate?,"Okay, so my mom lost her job a few months ago. Not because of Covid, but because her boss was, and is, a major asshole. We sued him and won, but because he has such an influence in the field my mom workes in, she lost (at least) 2 job opportunities because of him.

Anyway, she got a job offer, but it's not as high up as he wanted it to be, so she thinks about not taking it. Which concerns me because, I can't work at the moment, as I go to school and do not have the time to also work and my dad can't pay for everything forever. We do get a little money from the government, but it's not ideal.

Anyway, here's why I think I am the asshole.

It may not be diagnosed, but I think my mom suffers from a binge eating disorder. She also makes herself vomit almost everytime she eats a huge amount of junk food. Because I do not want my mom to do that, I don't buy her junk food, when I go to the store. Which makes her scream at me, but whatever. Anyway, today she asked me to get her, like, 10 chocolate bars. I told her no, so my sister went. I asked her not to buy her them, or eat least not that much, but all she said was: ""She is in so much stress right now, you're such an asshole because you refuse to get her chocolate!"". After she asked me if I wanted anything, she left.",Not the A-hole
AITA for backing out of being Maid of Honor?,"I’ve been best friends with this girl for 10+ years. She was supposed to get married in 2020 but pandemic, so her wedding has been postponed now twice (2 years). She asked me to be MoH back in 2019 and I said yes. I wanted to go abroad but didnt because of bach party/other wedding related events. I stayed living in a city I was having issues meeting people in (to be available for her) and was happy to make the sacrifice. Then the pandemic hit and I moved back in with my parents for a short time. 

Over the pandemic, a lot of things were revealed about our friendship. She got weirdly jealous when i moved into a new house specifically because I was getting really lonely and started making friends even though us doing our own thing has never been an issue in our past. We’re both in our 30s.

She ended up getting married virtually, i attended happily and bought her a gift. 

She also got diagnosed with a lifelong disease and i bought her an expensive care package and took her to the spa

Around the same time I got diagnosed with a serious but temporary medical condition due to side effects from a medication. It snowballed over a 4 month period of time and I had to go to the ER. I told her about it a few times over a few months and she said I was obsessed and needed to get over it. 

I also broke up with the guy I had started seeing (and was very excited about) because i was in such bad shape and her response was that I always rush into relationships.

At this point i stopped telling her anything about what was going on in my life. Over the years of our friendship I always tried to show up for her, and I feel it had been reciprocated until this last year.

A few weeks later after serious consideration about my health, I told her i needed to take care of myself and asked if it was possible if the other bridesmaid could take over MoH duties. She basically lost her shit for a moment and told me she was super hurt and it felt like i was rejecting her. We ended up not talking for like a week and then called and she cried to me on the phone and told me her husband was very angry at me. I told her i had told her several times about my health issues and that her responses had been very dismissive. She recognized that she had been an asshole and asked if I still wanted to go to her wedding (and gave me the option of being in The bridal party) and I said let me get my health in order and to give me a few months. 

Over the last 2 months I’ve gotten back into good enough health & went abroad. I have some clarity and I don’t really want to go to her wedding knowing that both her and her husband reacted so negatively to my health but can also get over it. 

There are some other details I’m leaving out but is leaving me questioning being friends with her since so many things have happened in such a short time.. Still processing. 

I’m supposed to give her an answer soon.

AITA for ‘demanding’ onions on my burger?,"I’ve got coeliacs, it sucks and I miss gluten. Tonight I went out for dinner and ordered a GF version of a burger burger, which had onion rings on it. Now I’ve never come across a place which does GF onion rings *and this place didn’t have GF onion rings either, and would instead the GF option that costs extra comes with less stuff* so I asked if it would come with normal fried onions instead. 

The waitress told me I could add onion, and it would cost $2 extra. I could buy a bag of onions for that price, and explained it wasn’t really ‘extra’, it was the GF option for the burger. 

Because it is? Why should I not get any onion on my burger, and pay more (on top of the $3 coeliac tax I already have to pay) to get what I paid for? 

She told me if I wanted onions, I’d have to pay for onions, I reminded her I had (the more expensive form of the onions).

Ended up escalating to the manager, who relented to my side after a few minutes of talking.

I’m not in the US, so our country doesn’t have a ‘customer is always right’ attitude. Often, waitstaff will instead act like you’re a burden and do the bare minimum. Which is chill, I’m nice and remained polite the whole time. I just think it’s a rort for me to be expected to pay another $2 on top of a $28 burger for onions! 

One of my mate’s I was with said I was a dick for not just paying (but agreed I wasn’t rude), but I’m sick of already paying a bloody tax on every meal because of a medical condition.

Edit: seems people are calling me the asshole based on misunderstandings. This is a somewhat expensive restaurant already, the onions are $1 cheaper than the onion rings I was already going to get if it wasn’t GF. I was paying extra from the get go for GF only to actually end up with less on my burger. That seemed crazy to me.",Not the A-hole
"AITA For being the best man for my best friend's fiancé, even though I don't really know him?","So this is a situation that developed lately that I've been getting absolutely blasted on socials for.  


I (23M) have a best friend (24F) who is about to get married in September to her boyfriend (26/7M).   


*Let me paint the picture about our friendship:*  
We've known each other for, 9-10 years and we are pretty close (tried dating but it didn't work out so we stayed friends). I've been there through her previous boyfriends, through her mental health issues, home issues.. Basically everything since puberty to this point. We are very close and I consider her more of a family than my actual family, and I know she sees me the same. Her fiancé knows all about this and is fine with it. I took him once on the side to talk face to face if this is ACTUALLY fine and not just a facade he keeps for her.  


Since her engagement a year ago, she has been telling me she wants to me to act as her witness (signature on the marriage certificate) and ""best man"" (just a civil partnership, no church stuff so it wouldn't be an issue) but her christian family fought hard that even though it's not religious, they want her to do it more traditionally, so I've been replaced by her female best friend. Because of this, her fiancé offered that I be his best man and witness, replacing his cousin that he grew up with and was very close.  
I made sure several times that it's okay, that they both want it, that it's a mutual decision etc but a few days ago, I started getting some messages from his family members, all of them basically just calling me the AH for doing this because I'm not actually close to him. We are friends, but we honestly don't talk unless it's when I visit them.   
I know they said it's okay, but I also know this cousin is the only family member in his life that he actually likes, respects and is close to. The cousin has not contacted me.

AITA for not telling my fiance how much I spend to get my hair done?,"I decided to dye may hair platinum blonde. I'm of Korean decent and my hair is long and is both extremely dark and extremely thick. For those who don't know it is difficult and takes time and effort especially to get any hair blonde buy especially Asian hair. It took two salon appointments that were 6+ hours each and each one cost about $400. After the initial appointments I now have to go in every two weeks to get my roots and the color touched up and those appointments are $150. Plus I spent a couple of hundred on a few hair products every month. I have had platinum hair for over three months and I love it. It is a lot of work but I don't care because of how much I like being blonde.

My fiance spent mid-March to mid-June out away doing fieldwork (we are both grad students, though in different areas). I had been thinking about making the change for a while but I did it a couple of weeks after she left. When we did video calls she said she liked it. She didn't voice any objection until she returned from her fieldwork and saw the bank/spending records. She is upset at how much my hair costs. I know it is a lot but we don't usually consult each other on every purchase the other makes. I've been a lot more frugal with our grocery budget and I put the rest on my credit card. I think she is overreacting about the price. She thinks I am wrong for spending so much when we are on a student budget. Even though she said she liked it when we Skyped while she was away I suspect she doesn't like it now. Not only does she complain about the costs, but also about the products and the maintenance I do at home and that I can only wash it once a week now. Was I really wrong for not telling her how much it costs? I've never asked her for permission to spend money before and I don't think I should have to start now.",Asshole
AITA for refusing to stick up for my mom as MIL screamed at her?,"My MIL is annoying. I'm not going to sugarcoat that. She is like a freaking chihuahua, super reactive. MIL's husband is a very nice man and has five grandkids the same age as my kids, he is very good with them, and my kids adore him. The other day we had a party for my three year old and MIL was holding my baby and went to hand him to her husband. SFIL has burns on his hand from something that happened when he was a kid. My mom freaked out and tried to snatch my son, and demanded to know what that was and if it was contagious. I gave the baby back to him and MIL and told my mom it was a burn and that was totally inappropriate.

Later my mom made a comment to me that his hand was gross, but he probably makes good money because he works for a big architecture firm, so maybe that is why MIL can overlook the burn. I ignored her. Towards the end of the party, my mom was talking about how my dad won't do anything adventurous in the bedroom. The kids weren't around, but still eww. My husband's stepmom, who gets along well with MIL, made a comment about how MIL has good sex because of something involving their sink. I tried shutting it down, but my mom asked MIL if his ""messed up hand"" gets in the way or distracts her.

MIL reacted in typical MIL fashion calling my mom ugly, a bitch, a cunt, saying my dad is probably getting sex somewhere else. I walked away and went inside with the kids. My mom came in with tears to gather her stuff and leave. She told me I was a bad daughter for just walking away, and how could I let someone talk to her like that?

WIBTA for asking my ex MIL for help in my upcoming wedding?,"Hi this hasn't happened yet but I'm considering doing this and my fiancé said it would be an asshole move on my part to do.

One year ago, right before the pandemic, I [30F] finalized my divorce with my ex husband Kyle [30M].  We ended on somewhat amicable terms.  There was no cheating involved on either side and no abuse or anything like that.  He just got fired from his job a few months after our wedding and in over two years never looked for a new job, never got help for his depression, refused therapy or anti depressants, and barely helped with the housework.  So I fell out of love and decided I was done.

To be honest I miss his family more than I miss being around him.  His parents and his two sisters were both aware of what we were going through and do not blame me at all for ending things.  We're still somewhat close in that we talk a lot on Facebook and share things with each other about our lives.  I stay respectful to my ex husband in that we're not together so I'm not in his personal business or anything like that.  Doesn't mean I don't care about them.

Well come to the present.  My current fiancé James [26M] proposed in June and I said yes.  We had only been dating for 10 months but we've known each other for longer and have been good friends for a while.  He helped me out with a lot of things during my divorce and we haven't seen a lot of other people since we were still in a pandemic.  Things just clicked.  This was the kind of relationship I'd always wanted with my ex husband.

Anyway since this was my second wedding and he doesn't have a lot of family in the area anyway, we decided we were going to get married on a cruise and pay for all our guests airfare to the cruise location and most of their actual cruise.  They also don't need to get us any gifts.  Still that's going to be somewhat costly on us.  We can afford it and it's something we really want so we're willing to do it regardless of anything else.

Well my ex MIL is a retired travel agent.  She knows people, she knows everything about cruises, and she gets a lot of good deals.  I wanted to ask her if she had any advice and if she could pass on information about some good deals she knew about and could help us take advantage of.  She's offered to do this before in the past I just don't know if it would be tacky to take advantage of her offer for this specific thing.

I also plan on getting her and my ex FIL a gift as a thank you for the help.  James doesn't want me to do it.  He says it's an asshole move getting my former family in law's help with my wedding to someone new.  He also thinks it would hurt Kyle a lot if he found out about it.  To be honest, I'm not entirely worried about that.  He already knows through Facebook that I'm getting remarried anyway.  But he has a point that it might be cruel to my ex MIL.  I still want to attempt to do it anyway.  So reddit, would I be the asshole?",Asshole
AITA for expecting my brother to receive the same treatment?,"This isn’t an overly complicated situation but I do feel I’m not the worst for wanting this but I’ll leave that up to you. 

So I (22f) my sister (19f) and brother (14m) each split the house chores between us one of us does housework (bins, vacuum and mop) 
One of us does dishes for the entire week 
And one of us takes care of our cat and dog (feed, take out for bathroom breaks, walk and bath twice a week) 

My sister is not the problem in any way shape or form they do the job every time no complaint 
There is a catch to our jobs though, if you don’t complete your week you repeat the one you didn’t finish AND the next weeks chores giving the other sibling a week off. 

My brother has reached that fun time where he doesn’t like to listen and just plays video games or goes out with friends as a result he pretty much does the bare minimum, he leaves the dishes up to our mother and only completes them on Sunday so that he can “avoid” repeating a second week. 
His housework he never completes so I haven’t actually done that in a few weeks as that seems to be the only job he is made to repeat.

What’s finally made me fed up is this last week he was on pets week, he did NOT clean our cats litter he did NOT walk our dog and left most of the toilet breaks up to us. 
He was not made to repeat...

I was on dishes, I have recently gotten married and like to switch between staying with my husband at his house and us at my house (no money for our own place yet) I give full notice so they know if I’m going to stay there.

I get back on Sunday and was told because I left for 2 days I had to repeat my dishes and do the pets this week. I asked why I had to repeat when I gave the notice and my brother didn’t even do his job and didn’t have to repeat.

I was told to shut up and just get over it
Here’s where I may be the a**hole, I said if my parents didn’t coddle my brother he wouldn’t feel he could get away with what he does and he should be made accountable the same as me and my sister.

AITA if I don't invite my biological father to my wedding?,"Hi, sorry about the formatting and such. This is my first post, and I'm on mobile. 

So as the title suggests, would I be the asshole here?
So, I just recently got engaged to my wonderful partner in April on our anniversary. We are currently planning our wedding, and this is where the trouble and drama starts. 
My biological father called me and asked to walk me down the aisle, after numerous times of me saying no. I told him I would not be comfortable with that due to many years of abuse and that the fact that he constantly plays the victim and chooses women over his children. I told my biological father that I would feel more comfortable with my mother, my stepfather, or one of my brothers to walk me down. My biological father questioned if he could attend my wedding, and I said it would be fine but his current partner (I'll call her Jen)would not be invited after this weird letter she wrote to me on Facebook. Jen absolutely hates my biological father's children and constantly talks badly about us. Jen is also a racist, an ableist, and is just plain hateful. Though, my biological father ""left"" Jen, and moved out while she was at work without telling her. I put left in quotations because he ended still seeing her and lied about it ""because it would upset us (his children) too much.  
 Anyway, when I told him that Jen would not be invited, he claimed it was unfair. That I cannot tell him who to be with etc. To make it clear, I never told him that, I just don't want unnecessary drama on my wedding day. And honestly, after looking back on his past behaviors, I don't want him there either.

AITA for not inviting my fiancé's aunt to our wedding ceremony?,"Hi, everyone.

I always dreamed of getting married, but I never wanted a big wedding. I don't like being put on a spotlight and the whole idea of professing such deep and personal feelings for someone I love in front of a crowd makes me uncomfortable. I always dreamed of eloping to Italy.

I got engaged just a few weeks before COVID hit. My fiancé and I were talking about wedding plans (he knew I wanted to elope), and his only reservation was that he wanted his grandfather, parents and sisters there. I said of course, they're family, I want them to be there too.

My close family only consists of my mother and my little brother. Those are the only people I'm bringing to Italy to watch the ceremony.

But since we have friends and other family members, we agreed on having a weeding party to celebrate our wedding when we get back from Italy on June 2022. I want to get married in June, and I hope that by then the COVID situation will be better. So, everything was working out perfectly, right?

Of course not.

My sisters in law were out shopping and met my fiancé's cousins. They started chatting, and eventually the topic of the wedding came up. They were understandably upset that they weren't invited to the ceremony. Even if they are distant cousins, they're still family and love my fiancé and want to be there for him too. I understand why they are upset. If someone in my family got married and didn't invite me, I would be upset too.

I felt bad and guilty when my SiL told me that, so I talked to my fiancé and we decided to call his cousins and talk it out, explain the situation. We got on the phone with them, explained that it was going to be a very small ceremony with just immediate family. There weren't going to be any friends, bridesmaids, guests, nothing. Just us, the Italian countryside and a preach. We also said that we're inviting them to the wedding party to celebrate our wedding with us, we'd love to have them there, etc. They understood, but were very annoyed and giving only ""Hmms"" and single worded responses, which I don't blame them for.

I asked my fiancé if we should bite the bullet and invite them too, if he wanted them there. My fiancé said no, that we agreed on immediate family only and if we invited them we'd have to invite the rest of our family's too, it wasn't fair.

My fiancé got a call from his aunt who was screaming so much she sounded like an alien. She asked him how he dared not to invite his family to his wedding, she even called me a bitch and accused me of hating his family (which I don't, I adore his family, that's why I'm spending thousands of dollars on a wedding party so we can be together). My fiancé got very upset and said that his aunt was no longer invited to the party and hang up.

I am still in shock and can't believe this happened. Am I really a bitch because I want a private wedding ceremony with the man I love? AITA for not inviting his aunts and cousins?",Not the A-hole
AITA? My aunt has overstepped,"AITA? My mom's 66th birthday is coming up and since we didn't get to celebrate last year, my daughter and I decided to treat her to a trip to Washington DC. Backstory. The three of us are very close. We tend to hang out a lot, going to dinner, on trips and such. My aunt, my mom's younger sister, is a Complete nutcase and we rarely involve her in anything the 3 of us do together. Today I go on the Book and see where she has posted that she wants to do something for her only sister, since nobody else will, she has too. We celebrate my mom on a regular basis not just birthdays and holidays. My aunt was very mean and dismissive to her mom, my grandma, when she was living but now she wants to paint the picture that she was the golden child. 

So, anyway,  I text my aunt and say that the post made me feel like she was saying that I don't do anything for my mom and that we actually are planning on being out of town for her birthday. I even say that I am pretty sure that she didn't intend for it to sound that way. She then goes back to Facebook and says that since SOMEONE is all up in their feelings, she was referring to them being siblings. I responded back this time pissed off. She of course deletes my comment. 

She texts me back claiming that she is not going back and forth with me. I told her that all she had to do was ask me what we (her children and grandchildren) had planned for our mother. She tells me it has nothing to do with me. And maybe it was all my fault because I didn't ask her if she wanted to go to Washington with us. (We have never been on trips with her), And I was wrong for not thinking about how that would make her feel. She didn't even know about the trip until I told her which was after she made the post. So now all the family on Facebook is telling her how sweet and wonderful she is and my mama doesn't want anything to do with her. So am I the asshole?",Asshole
AITA For Chewing out my mom,"To preface this I should add my mother and I don't have the best relationship but I give her a chance... She abused drugs for most of my life, took my away from my father and kicked me out to live with my father at 14(Currnetly 17 and she has been living with us for about a yearr) because she and my sister wanted a house to do drugs in... She is now clean(ish) and lost everything due to covid, me and my father decided to let her live with us(rent and bill free) under the conditon she 1. Takes me to and from practices, the gym, my work untill I get my license(9 month permit period) and 2. Cleans the house, and cooks.  
Recently she has gotten more irritable, and or just angry. She doesn't like how I clean things(Not detailed enough) Which I admit I am not the best at but I clean when asked, albeit maybe a few hours later as I am usually doing things..... Most recently she and I got into an arugment over how I wake her up to go to the gym around 11am on off days and 7:30 on work days... She says ""every morning you ruin my sleep by waking me up to go to the gym.. every fucking morning, what do you do around the house? little to nothing""(Now keep in mind my room is clean, and I do the dishes I make, and the trash ect...) I chewed her out by saying ""The ONLY reason you are here is to clean, and take me to and from places, I get my full license in a month. It isn't hard to wake up..... sit there while I drive, and take a nap, or walk the dog for an hour or 2 a day. You accepted those two things, and you live here free.""(I could've worded better but She got ENRAGED) AITA? If i am :( fuck",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I told my parents I won’t care about their health if they don’t make any changes?,"On mobile so sorry for bad formatting and any spelling errors, and all that stuff.

Me (M 20s) and my parents have a great relationship and I wouldn’t change anything about what we have. However, in the past year or so I, I feel they’ve really let their bad habits get the best of them. They’ve both been smokers my whole life and have always drank, just nothing excessive, but since last year it seems like they’re smoking way more then they used to and both their drinking has gone up a lot, to the point where some people might consider them functioning alcoholics. The main cause to this problem is that they both lost their parents last year, and so when you’re sad you go to your vices to feel better. 

Quitting these bad habits has been something they’ve been telling me and my brother my whole life they would do but it never happens for more then a couple months at most until they’re back at it. Now on top of what I’ve previously mentioned they’ve also been gaining weight, my mind worse then my dad, and it just hurts to see them changing before my eyes. Now it’s gotten to the point where I feel like if they don’t make some big changes soon, they won’t have many years left leaving my brother and I in the exact same position they’re currently in. So basically I plan on telling them if they don’t make any changes soon how can they expect me to care when it inevitably leads them to an early grave. 

This is the part where I feel I would be TA, since it’s not exactly the nicest way of going about it, but I’m tired of hearing their excuses and I feel it’s gotten to the point where they won’t make a change without hearing something like that.

Edit 1- Just want to add a quick edit to say that my out of the blue comment isn’t really accurate. I’ve talked about it with them before, I’ve just never really said something so drastic before.",Asshole
AITA for not wanting to hold a baby,"I (35f) met my husband, Charles (40m), 5 years ago. He has been friends with Kayla (30sF) since they were in high school. Her and her husband, Alan (40sM), had their first baby last year. Hubs and I are childfree, though he's pretty good with kids while I'm more awkward around them. I am also an introvert and socially awkward as well.They know this. We were invited over to meet the new baby Addie last month with a few other friends. 

We get there and say our hellos. Hubs goes to get us drinks and Kayla brings over Addie to me and asks if I would like to hold her. Before I can even finish saying no thank you she has shoved her baby into my arms. My face apparently showed my annoyance and surprise, because she started laughing and goes, ""Oh wow you look like a shocked pickachu!""

I tried to hand Addie back to her, but she backed away still laughing and calls for our husband's to come over. Everyone is now looking at me and I'm so embarrassed. I try again to hand back her baby. AND SHE WONT TAKE HER! So I take Addie and put her in the playpen thing and walk out the door. 

Hubby followed me out to the car and asked if I was alright. I told him I just want to go home. Kayla and Alan follow us outside. Tells me ""she's just a baby"", ""Why won't you hold her"", ""it was just a joke"". I don't respond because I know I won't be able to hold in my feelings so I just got in the car. Charles is telling her to stop and Alan isn't saying anything. 

Hubby says he'll call her in a couple days and gets in car. As we're pulling away Kayla yells that I didn't have to be such a bitch about it and ruin the party. 

She has called all their mutual friends saying I'm a horrible person who hates children and I ruined the first party since covid and having a baby. A couple people from the party on her side saying I'm an AH but others are saying it's on her because she put me in that situation.

AITA Bad night out - am I overreacting?,"So, 
I was out for the euro finals (I don't like football but enjoy everyone's vibes). I have a friend - we will call him Dan - and had someone who I know vaguely from my social group - call him Tom. 
I was staying at Dan's who left early, as he had work but said to ring him when I left the pub so he could let me into his flat. Tom stayed out with me. Halfway through the night I thought I had misplaced my phone, and asked the bartend to keep an eye out as it had my card in also. 
I had a great night and got pretty drunk, I still didn't have my phone though so asked the bartend if he could call it. I said it was on loud so we would hear it. Couldn't hear it so decided to just try again the next day. 
I asked Tom to ring Dan to let me in, he said he didn't have his number (confirmed the next day that he did). I walked to Dan's and buzzed the flat but he must have been asleep. 
Tipping it down with rain and Tom asks me for a quicky and I decline, he is married and I'm not interested. He suggests walking back to the pub and there are some guys standing outside, I ask about somewhere to stay or an after-party and make several flirty jokes. Things start to get weird and a little too flirty for my liking. I start crying as I realize I may have to give one of these guys a BJ to have a place to stay out of the rain. They offer that I can stay with them if I stay in one of their beds. One of these guys (a nicer guy?) Said I didn't have to, after about ten minutes of me crying a bit then this other guy goes to get his phone out and pulls my phone out! I lose my shit and ask him why he has my phone. I can't even remember what he said and I snatched it away from him and rung Dan's. 
I end up crying for a good hour at his then get some sleep.
My thing is, I'm anxious because clearly I may have led them on somewhat and it looks from the outside that I'm being dramatic. 
Dan is going to go to the pub (his local) and hear all about this crazy girl that over reacted.
I don't know if I did, I don't know if I read too much into it or if I saved myself from a sticky situation.

I'm not reporting these guys as I think I am also at fault here.

Like she assumed it was a phase and this was proof it was not. The other night my brother (7M) asked about it and said it was cool. He than asked about getting one for him. I said it could be cool and I might get him one. This was when my mom stepped in and said ""no."" When I pushed on it and asked why she said ""just no"", ""is this really something I need to fight about"" and ""im the mom what I say gose"" and so I said ""ya know what I always thought you were Progressive. But here lately you're acting like a wine mom. You're okay with the gays as long as you don't have to talk to them and you kids aren't them.""

She tells me to tell my supervisors my ""tummy hurts"", I insist that I need the hours. She gets upset with me because she's having a bad day and that she has nobody else to see, and mentions that she never asks me for anything (untrue). I accidentally opened instagram while trying to expand the chat notification, but don't actually have time to read it. She then gives me hell for leaving her on read (not my intention), and I ask her to cut me some slack as she leaves me on read regularly only to respond hours later. This is when she tells me that one of her best friends died and that I was being an asshole for arguing with her. I begin to apologize profusely while also trying to defend myself for reacting how I did (I don't handle stress well while at work.) Its a long story, and it gets uglier, but she ended up not wanting to see me that day, and this is essentially the catalyst for our breakup.

AITA FOR TELLING MY DAD TO SHUT UP?1,"I (21yF) and my baby brother (10yM) had a difficult grow up life style, my dad (43yM) literally cannot see that him and my mom (44yF) are separate for almost 9 years and is literally drive me crazy, he's a good dad, not the best if isn't the part of manipulation and alienation parenting, when my mom speak to him of anything about us he goes and go offensive on her and start threatening to not let us leave and go back to our house (we live with our mom), we know he can't do this and also him.

AITA for calling my sisters husband useless?,"My (17F) sister (34F) called me saying that her work had an emergency and she needs to get there ASAP and needed me to watch her kids because “no one else can”. I rushed over there just to find her husband locked in his game room playing video games. I asked her why she called me over if he was home and she said he didn’t want to “babysit” because it was his only day off. 

Sister left, and I started hanging with the kids. I was changing the baby’s diaper and the other kids wanted a snack, I told them to go ask their dad to make them a snack since the baby had a blow out and it was going to take my awhile to clean him up. 

Well their dad sent them back upstairs and told them to ask me again. After cleaning the baby up I made the kids a snack and their dad came out to eat and told me not to let the kids interrupt him on his day off. (By the way, he works part time from home, 6 days a week).

I kind of snapped at him and told him it was MY day off too and that he’s a useless f*cking father and husband if his wife has to rely on her teenage sister rather than her own husband. He started telling me I was disrespectful and didn’t understand how hard parenting is, and I told him he clearly doesn’t understand how hard it is either since he considers parenting his own children “babysitting”. He ended up kicking me out and apparently my sister was forced to come home because he told her she needed to figure it out since I’m her sister. 

I feel like I may be the asshole because my sister is mad at me, her husband is mad at me, my mom is mad at me for causing drama, but my dad thinks it’s funny and agrees with me. I definitely didn’t need to call him names but I just hate this guy so much. We have argued about things in the past as well so we already don’t have a great relationship. My sister is saying I need to apologize to him and he is threatening to never let me into the kids lives if I keep disrespecting him.

Edit: wow I was not expecting this response at all. Thank you guys for all your comments, and to the people who messaged me dick pics or to kill myself... what? Why? Lol y’all are crazy. 

For anyone who has asked, no, he does not take care of the kids normally. My sister takes them to daycare during the day and then picks them up on her way home. She is the breadwinner and the primary caretaker. 

Also, I got a few questions of “does she pay you?” Not exactly, but she will randomly take me on expensive shopping sprees and will regularly buy things from my Amazon wishlist instead, and I have no problem with this arrangement. I really love those kids and don’t have an issue babysitting them, I love hanging out with them. 

I also don’t blame my mother for her being mad at me, just because of the fact that my sisters dumbass husband texted her and apparently told her a much different version of what happened, lol. He told her I was sitting on my phone the whole time being lazy and the kids kept begging me for a snack. 

Also, I did not yell at him in front of his kids. It was a private conversation.

AITA for forgetting to inform my friend?,"I live with one of the fellow students in my master’s degree program. I’m 26F she’s 25F. We usually help each other out with the assignments and projects. 
So our big project this semester is due on 3.08 but we occasionally give presantations throughout the semester to show how our project is going. The Professors announced last week on a very short notice that the written part of the Project should be “almost” done by the next presentation which on this coming monday, so way earlier than we all thought. It is already a hard project and we already had been working really hard, we had almost no time for ourselves so that put a lot of extra stress on us.

Anyways, a few days ago we had a non mandatory lecture and I attented to it, my friend didn’t. It was online and i was listening kinda half assed, didn’t really pay much attention. They gave some details about the submission and told us that even though it’s due on Monday we have to upload everything on Saturday since they want to have some time to take a look at everything. 

As I said I was already very stressed out these past days, my brain didn’t function properly and I think I assumed she already knew that info or maybe I thought I already told her. I just had a lot on my plate and it really was an honest mistake. 

Today other students were talking about it in our whatsapp group so she came to me and asked why I didn’t tell her about that. I said I thought she already knew and she got really angry and slammed the door against my face and hasn’t been talking to me since. She’s been avoiding me in the kitchen and acting really agressively when she needed to take something near me.

I mean I understand why she’s upset but i’m human too, i can forget things. It’s not like i did it on purpose. I haven’t even been sleeping properly it just slipped my mind. And it’s not my fault that she didn’t attended to the lecture. It’s just one day earlier, should’t be that big of a deal right?. I found her reaction kind of intense so I haven’t talked to her either. She’s an agressive person in general and likes to scold people. She frequently talks to me in that manner, as if I’m the child and she’s the parent. That pisses me of so I don’t think I’m going to apologize just because of the way she acts.

AITA for asking my sister to wear more clothing,"So some needed background my family has always been pretty athletic with a big focus on fitness and exercise. We also have a family business that owns a couple of warehouses. Because of this we have taken an unused corner of the warehouse and built a pretty good gym set up. So while the warehouse itself is owned by the company all the equipment has been purchased by myself, my siblings, Uncles, cousins etc. and its just a nice communal space.

About a year and a half ago my sister started to get into bikini division bodybuilding and has given it 110%. We all try to be very supportive and genuinely are proud of all the work that she's put in and how well she's doing. My wife and I even drove her 4 hours to her last show. However, as her bodybuilding has progressed she has started wearing less and less to the gym and it started to make a number of us a little uncomfortable. Shes started wearing her suit and doing a posing session in the middle of the communal area which is pretty awkward since a bikini competitors suit is basically a g-string. 

The straw that broke the camels back was when we were lifting and she told me ""hey you need to turn around and face the other way because I'm probably going to have a wardrobe malfunction doing this exercise."" So I finally asked her ""then why did you wear that to come workout? Other people use this space too and we shouldn't be barred from using equipment we payed for because you might flash us. If you are going to workout in a communal place you need to dress atleast practically""

She got mad and stormed out. Now granted maybe I could have been more diplomatic but was I wrong for asking her to dress more appropriately?

EDIT : She wears her suit to do her posing routine in the public space. She doesn't do exercises in the stage suit but what she does wear isn't much more coverage. Thus the ""I'm probably going to have a malfunction"" comment. Apologies if my writing wasn't the most clear",Not the A-hole
AITA for being 'unnecessarily mean' to a driver who breaks cut out and damaged our property?,"So I (23f) was in the back yard with my dog. I hear weird metal screeching and I see a car rolling down the hill. I call my dog in but it's too late. The car crashes into our garden, hitting our car, our dog and breaking down the brick wall as well as general damages to things in our garden.

I'm so shocked and in an adrenaline fuelled panic, I start screaming at the driver. I will admit, I called them all sorts of names. But I was also telling them to get out the car and to turn the engine off. I get that going from insults to trying to help will definitely scare and confuse someone, but my brain was frazzled and the insults were a shock, first reaction thing.

My boyfriend and neighbours had called police, ambulances and vets. Luckily everyone was ok. Dog had a fracture (thank god) and everyone in the car was ok. The people in the car stayed inside the car until the police arrived and it's a women and her toddler. She's in absolute hysterics.

The women and her toddler get taken to the hospital and the car gets towed. Boyfriend and I are talking about it with neighbours and one of them says it wasn't ok for me to scream at her like that. Boyfriend agrees and said it solved nothing. We later found out her breaks messed up so it wasn't even 'her fault' and now boyfriend thinks I'm even more of an asshole.

AITA: I (24f) won’t allow my brother (23m) to own a snake in our house,"So a little background, my brother and I live at home currently. My brother joined the military at 19 and was gone until may 2020 when he got medically discharged. I however lived at home until 22 since I went to trade school and couldn’t move out on my own. I moved in with my ex bf  and was on my own for 6 months until I moved back due to multiple issues in feb. 2020. we came home within months of each other. It’s safe to say that my parents are sick of us living with them, and decided as a family for my brother and I to get a house. This also included our mutual childhood friend (24m) and my bf (22m) living with us too. we have our parents involved with the house loan. my brother made some bad financial decisions and his credit isn’t the best.  And since this would be my parents for second residence,they couldn’t get approved for a loan without putting a huge amount of money down, we’re upper mid class. So, we made the decision keep him off the loan and title of the house and have it under myself as primary and my parents as secondary. It made everything cheaper, and to even the playing field my brother would put down more money so he was involved more. I agreed.  We went through the process and we found a property and now are trying to get everything finalized. But the whole process has not gone smoothly, my brother would make demands on what he wanted To do with the property and we definitely butted heads and gotten heated. We smoothed out most issues apart from a few. He wants to get a pet once we get into the house and my parents said no, with the exception of my cat since I took ownership of her when I moved out the first time and was established that she’d come with me when I moved out again. tho I generally like pets, he wants to get a snake or a reptile. I’m terrified of snakes and I dislike reptiles, so when he asked to get one, i said no. I would consider a dog but it wasn’t guaranteed and I’d have to wait until things settled to make a final decision. He got upset and told me how he always gets screwed over when it came to my parents and they play favorites. He didn’t think it’s fair that I could have my cat but he couldn’t get a pet, I reminded him we agreed that she was coming regardless and we agreed to live with the cat. My friend is claiming he hates cats and doesn’t want to live with her. I reminded them that I told him the deal and that if he didn’t want to live with the cat then he didn’t have to live with me since she goes where I go. Both are trying to convince me that it’ll be “more fair” if my brother gets a snake. I said I didn’t sign up to live with a snake and that I wouldn’t live with them if they got it. My plan is if they got one anyways, I’d call animal control and remove it from the home since it’ll technically be my house. I don’t want to pull the “its my house “ card.

AITA if I Insist on Rehoming our Dog?,"We just found out that our 13 month old dog has an enlarged heart. We have spent about $3K on him last year because of a parasite, his neutering, and trainers that have worked to an extent but because of advice to not have our dog around other dogs when he was a puppy for vaccination reasons (DO NOT TAKE THIS ADVICE LIKE WE DID-there are ways to socialize him without getting him sick, we know now 🙄) he still has severe socialization issues. We have an older cat who only has 2 rooms in our small apartment because he chases her out of the rest of the rooms- we were told by one of the trainers to ""let them go at it""...didnt take obvs. She's peed on every inch of our bed out of stress. We live paycheck to paycheck anyway, and then we learn that he had a congenital heart disease because the terrible breeder doesn't stop breeding the lines that have heart disease. We would have to take out a loan just for the consultation and tests. I have put aside going to school for a whole year to try to address his socialization issues and there has been progress but it has been very slow and I want to finally get a career instead of my retail job, and so does my husband. Also like I said our apartment is small but because of the socialization issues, our dog is afraid of going down the steps of our apartment because there are dogs nextdoor to the left and to the right. (I couldn't even let him go out to poop this morning because he just planted himself on the steps.) 

I just feel like people with more money and space and distance from other dogs would be able to help him more, and I don't want to put off going back to school for another year. My cat's a wreck, I haven't been able to see a doctor in months, I went a couple weeks without my medication to pay for his vet bills, my husband's already taken out a loan for him before, and its just getting unbearable, My husband used to object to even the thought of rehoming him, but now he's just so defeated. AITA?

Edit: Hey all just clarifying: we were not living paycheck to paycheck when we got the dog, but now we are because of the trainers and vet visits. This has all happened over the course of a year. We can afford future vet visits if we take out a loan but I will have to go at least another 6 months before going back to school. But no either way we will not be able to afford another dog for a long time. Also I am way too exhausted after all this for another dog.",Asshole

AITA for not telling someone she wasn't my friend?,"In third grade, I became friends with a girl from my school who I will call Annie (not her real name). After a while I started not being comfortable with her being my friend anymore. She started being too clingy and I decided to stop spending time with her. At least that's how I remember. A few years have passed, we're both still in that school, she went to a class and I went to another, I made other friends who left that school and now I only have a single friend there, but I haven't seen them in over a year, because they have asthma and can't go to school because of, y'know, pandemic, quarantine, etc.

So, remember when I said she went to a class and I went to another? Well, these two classes got together and now we're in the same class again. Since I didn't have much people to talk to for a while, sometimes Annie would try to talk to me, look at my drawings, try to start a subject. She likes things like anime and RPGs, so sometimes she'd come over to me and say something like ""hey, you know that thing that was revealed about Boku No Hero? What do you think of it?"" and stuff like that. And since those are subjects I quite enjoy, I'd politely answer and even rant about it for a few minutes. She'd show me her own drawings and I'd also not be rude and just reply something like ""that's cool."" Nothing much, but apparently it was enough for her to believe we were friends. I never referred to her as a friend, I never tried to get closer to her, we never hung out or went to eachother's houses, and I thought she didn't either. But I also never said to her face ""we are not friends.""

Today, Annie messaged me about something random that is pretty unimportant, but she said something around the lines of ""I'm your friend, you can tell me."" At that moment I realized that she had a wrong idea of what she was to me. I coldy answered with ""no, I'm not."" A few messages go, Annie starts thinking that I'm saying we're not friends because I"" am mad at her"" and I had to explain that no, we weren't friends ever since third grade, this wasn't because of a stupid little argument. She started accusing me of deceiving her, tricking her into thinking we're friends, treating her as a friend and lying to her (her words translated, not mine), but I never did any of that, I never said we were friends and I clearly never treated her like one of my friends. She was just a classmate who I sometimes talked to, I'm sorry she didn't understand that, I thought I was being clear enough.

Annie blocked me and I bet she's gonna be pissed when vacation's over and we go back to school. I really don't mind her being mad at me, because, y'know, she wasn't my friend in the first place and I honestly won't miss her if she distances. But I do feel like maybe I didn't have the proper attitude in this situation. So I'd like Reddit's opinion.

AITA for refusing to move/take down a new garden pergola?,"Obligatory throwaway and posting on a mobile. 

My husband and I (20sF) have lived next door to K and F (70s) for 10 years. We have always gotten along well and though we do not socialise, have always stopped for friendly chats and kept an eye on each other’s houses when away etc. Our houses are detached and we live on a hill, with our house being higher than theirs by, say, 2-4 feet. 

K and F are very opinionated on various matters and like to express their views on work we have had done to our house. I am talking about internal works which have zero impact on them. We’ve always smiled and nodded and passed it off to an older generation trying to pass on advice/wisdom etc. 

We are currently doing work to our garden. We had our garden re-designed and the new design incorporates a wooden pergola which goes halfway along the border we share with K and F. It has now been built. It is just under 7 feet high and is around 13 feet long. We did tell K and F about the new layout, where the pergola would be and this was reiterated when they came into our garden before the work started and took a few of our plants that we didn’t want. 

Cut to yesterday, I was invited around to their house where they shouted at me for about 10 minutes about the pergola. They called it a monstrosity a number of times and were also critical of our garden design. They said I ought to have got their approval on our plan and that I am selfish as they now have to look at the top 2 feet of the pergola over their fence. I asked what I could do and offered to buy some screening hedge to plant between the pergola and the boundary fence but that was not acceptable.  I explained the pergola will be planted with mature wisteria and that it will eventually be a mass of flowers. Again, they didn’t care and want it moved. They are no longer speaking with us. 

I agree it doesn’t look great from their side at the moment but ultimately it won’t look the way it does now for long. Legally speaking I have done nothing wrong. It does not impact on light either. But…

AITA for not offering to move/take down the pergola? That would involve a lot of costs and it is an integral part of the garden design.

AITA for not wanting to come home every weekend from college?,"I, 19 year old female am heading to my sophomore year in college this coming Semester. I have a sponsorship so my tuition + dorm fees are fully paid off. My mother expects me to come home every weekend or ""ask her"" every week to stay on campus during the day on Saturdays and get picked up at night. (\~2 hour drive, would have to leave evening time the next day to drive back)

Essentially, I've told her that I want o learn to be more independent, that I don't mind if things get difficult because I want to be able to take accountability for my actions and grow from my mistakes as a human. (Up until this point, I have not been allowed to be in any situations where I make ""mistakes"") My mom tries to do everything for me (cook, etc) so I've never learned how to do anything. I don't want to keep living like this until my thirties. (I'm allowed to be independent when I get married and start a family, like that's not even being independent?) I'd rather make mistakes and learn from them and grow as a person while my peers are doing the same. I also mentioned how I no longer want to ask for her permission to stay on campus every week, whether it be to study, hang out with friends, part time job commitments, or school events. I tried expressing how the way she wants things is no different than it being a ""glorified high school experience"" where I wasn't allowed to make decisions for myself (which killed my social life in a way where I never got to make genuine friendships outside of class)

This subject makes her upset so I don't bring it up but she ALWAYS talks about it and gets mad. I understood her POV for ""empty nest syndrome"" up until today when she threw a screaming tantrum about how ""If I choose not to respect her rules, I no longer have a home and can never step foot in the house ever again"" and that the moment I pack up and leave, she will ""forget that she ever had a daughter because the thought of having such an awful daughter disgusts her"". I was screamed at to get out of the house and how she is ""ashamed to have wasted 19 years of her life raising an ""evil brat"" who hurts her feelings. She then proceeded to invalidate my sadness from her words and continued on the narrative on how I SCARRED her heart.

I do not believe anything I said warranted this response from her but I can't help but feel that maybe I should've just sucked it up and agreed to come home every weekend.

With all of the verbal berating I received yesterday, I truly did start to believe I was in the wrong. Thank you for showing me that I should stand up for myself and not tolerate her BS.

Aita for getting annoyed with my gf because she never closes the door,"I come home from work and the door that I’ve asked her nicely sooo many times to keep shut is wide open. All the time. 

It’s just a big extra bedroom turned into a closet so I don’t want to pay for the heat/AC in there and I don’t want the cat in there. I also don’t care to see the clutter as it’s sort of a mess. I come home and it’s open so I’m sure it’s been open all day and I don’t want to sound like a meizer but I just like to keep my utility bills down. 

I have explained it to her many, many times that I want the door kept shut. 

It is so annoying to me. 

I just want the common courtesy of being listened to. She doesn’t pay any rent. I’m not asking for that much, but she gives me this huge attitude when I reminder her to keep the door shut and she says I “don’t need to scold her like a dad” but like wtf just shut the door.

AITA for inviting my dad to my graduation?,"
Bit of background, when I (21F) was 12 my parents split up and it was really really bad. They both did nasty things to each other and it was difficult for my twin and I. I ended up moving away with my mum and my brother stayed with my dad (our choice). Over the years I had little to no contact with my dad. Every phone I had went “missing”. I suspect my mum took them away. She hated my dad and always spoke bad about him. and that I had contact with him. I wasn’t allowed to see him at all but Christmas was the despite a court order. I was always guilt tripped into staying with my mum “you’ll really leave me all alone at Christmas” but my dad always let my brother come up and see me. While my dad never really speaks bad about my mum, she always talks bad about him, saying to me “I wish he would just drop dead”. They’ve only just divorced due to other reasons. Anyway, since I’ve been 17/18 I’ve had regular contact with my dad and though mum doesn’t like it, she can’t stop me as I bought my own phone. I’ve just finished my 3 years at university and will be graduating in a few months. I really struggled with it and didn’t think I was going to graduate so I’m really proud of myself for doing so. They both supported me throughout Uni. My mental health suffered and if I was having tough days I would talk to them both. My dad understood my anxiety and stress more with my mum not believing me. I don’t want to paint my mum as the bad guy because I’ve ether years she has done a lot to help and support me but I want them both to come to my graduation, however my mum refuses to go if my dad is there saying he did nothing to help me during my secondary school education and the fight for him to pay child support and keeps sending me crappy messages about how I’ve changed and is being off with me. She also has my house in her name and I’m scared she’ll cancel the tenancy if I don’t invite her. Recently as well I found the court order where she agreed to purchase train tickets for me to travel to see my dad, however she never did such thing. Instead of looking forward to my graduation I’m now dreading it and kind of just want to have neither of them there. A lot of people agree with me and say she’s being selfish, but she and a few others think I’m wrong for inviting him.  I’m torn because I don’t know if I’m wrong or not.

AITA for calling my friend an asshole and telling him to seek therapy?,"So my (21F) friend Jose, (20M) is a pretty chubby guy and has admitted in the past that he feels self-conscious about his weight. Whenever our group of friends hang out, we always take a picture together. Jose always volunteers to take the picture. When someone else volunteers to take it, he insists on doing it. Our friends have tried to get him to be in the pictures, but he declines every time. It kind of creates an awkward situation.

Last Sunday, after Jose took yet another picture of us, I asked him why he never wants to be in the pictures. Jose admitted that he doesn't like how he looks in photos because his belly pokes out like a sore thumb. Apparently, he wants to get fit first so that he can actually feel proud and happy when he sees himself. He then turned to me and asked me if he was being an asshole for always being the one to take the group photo.

I could have just lied to make him feel better, but I decided to be honest. I said yes, he was an asshole because his refusal to be in the pictures makes the rest of us uncomfortable, as if he doesn't want to be associated with us. Would it kill him to be in ONE picture?? No one cares if he's overweight! We love him for who he is on the inside!

Jose looked at me in shock and said he was sorry. I continued with my honesty by telling him that his negative self-image was not contributing to a healthy mentality and that there are red flags pointing toward him developing an eating disorder. I also recommended him to seek a therapist to resolve these issues. It will do wonders for him! He'll stop with his photo avoidance!

Jose became angry and told me that I can't just assume that he has an eating disorder and that he needs a therapist. I tried to explain myself, but he told me to fuck off. I admit, I started tearing up and cried on my way home.

AITA? I know you guys are huge advocates for therapy and mental health awareness, I'm sure you can understand where I'm coming from! Was I really wrong for what I said to Jose? I'll make sure to read your feedback! ❤

AITA for not allowing my neighbors dog to stay at my apartment for a couple of hours?,"So I (24f) was on a vehicular accident a week ago. I have a hairline fracture on my left ankle (on cast) and huge bruise on my thigh and my waist. My fiancé (25m) moved to my apartment a few days ago to take care of me. He works from home and he's currently the one managing and cleaning the house. 

A few hours ago my upstairs neighbor messaged me if I could watch her very hyper dog (belgian malinois) for a few hours, because she has an important meeting to attend (for promotion). I reminded her that I can't watch her dog because I have a foot injury and my body still hurts. She told me that my fiancé can look after her dog for a few hours. Now my fiancé has a dog that is currently staying at his brother's house for the mean time because we don't want the dog bumping to my foot or body slamming me when he gets playful. I told her no that his also busy. 

A few minutes later she came knocking on my  door crying my fiancé open up the door. She told him that this is her only opportunity for the interview and she might lose chance being promoted. My fiancé told her sorry but no that he is very busy and we don't want her dog accidentally bumping on my foot and he closed the door. 

Now she send a message on our group chat and said me and my fiancé we're TA because apparently she missed her interview, and it's our fault she's not promoted. 2 of the tenants sided with me but the 4 others thought we're TA. I just messaged them then why didn't they offer to look for her dog for few hours then?

AITA for not buying a video game cosmetic for a friend?,"Mandatory english is not my first language 

So i known this guy for years and we are pretty good friends. Lets call him Bill. Bill LOVES spending money in video games and buying other people cosmetics / games (he said this multiple times). He also does this when he cant afford it. (cant pay rent to parents? still buys skins to MY friend who he never met before because he plays a charachter that Bill likes). 

Me on the other hand cant really afford to spend money on games. Im working too but im living with a roommate and have a worse paying job. So i basically never spend money on these things. Bill gifted me a lot of stuff over the years. (even when i specifically told him i dont want to and i feel bad).

A close friend of mine passed away after a long battle with cancer and left me around  90\~ euros to spend it on games or something that i like. So i decided that finally i can buy some stuff for myself and dont have to rely on other people's generosity.

So queue the AITA.  Bill hears about this and says i should buy him a cosmetic. I told him politely no. i finally have something i can spend on myself from literally my friends will who specifically said to buy something for myself. He becames really mad says he bought me so much stuff and now that he cant afford it and i can, i wont even buy him that. The cosmetic he wants is 20 euros. 

Also i should note he has a habit of buying stuff he really cant afford. He has been fighting with his parents about not paying rent and still buys skins for random people like i mentioned before. (but not for himself for some reason)

AITA for coming late to a family vacation in order to avoid my grandparents?,"Backstory: My dad’s parents are not good people. My grandma was one of those boy moms that refused to let her son go and hated my mom from the second they got together. My mom is an amazing person and I have always resented them for the way they treat her.

I have 3 younger siblings, and they are nasty to us as well. It’s me (23F), my brothers (21M & 17 M) and my sister (15F). When we were younger, they would constantly call my youngest brother and I fat (we both were normal, healthy weights but carried our baby fat for longer than my other siblings) and would constantly comment on our diets and eating habits. My sister has pretty severe ADD and they would always comment about how stupid she was and how my moms poor parenting is enabling her immature behavior (my mom is literally a teacher with experience handling learning disabilities). The only one my grandparents seem to enjoy is my other brother (21M) and I know it is because he looks and acts identical to my dad when he was younger, while the rest of us look and act more like my mom (who they hate). My grandma has literally called my brother “sexy” to me before, while telling me I should have him help me out at the gym since he’s in such great shape. 

My whole life, i have been tolerating rude behavior from my grandma and downright creepy behavior from my grandpa. Last year’s vacation was the last straw for me. My boyfriend at the time came with me. While him and my grandpa were sitting on the deck, i was walking to the dock in a bathing suit and he told my boyfriend he can “see how I would get him excited in bed.” My boyfriend was appalled and obviously told me what he said. 

I took this up with my dad and he told me it was probably taken out of context. I love my dad dearly, and he is a great father, but he is downright in denial about his parents behavior and i think it has to do with him being scared of his father. I told my dad i would not be attending the next family trip with them because this comment put me over the edge. I explained how he has made me uncomfortable all of my life but my comments were always shrugged off since i was the only girl my age and everyone thought i was being dramatic. Well now, i have three younger girl cousins and a sister who are now old enough to endure the same uncomfortable comments and behaviors. They have made me realize my experiences and feelings were valid all of this time as they unfortunately have had them too. 

Over the past year, my mom and I decided we would go late to the family vacation only because it means a lot to my dad and i don’t think my grandparents will be around much longer. This was a compromise i decided to make instead of the alternative of not going at all. 

My dad is upset with my decision and thinks i am overreacting. So, AITA?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA for refusing MORE of my time if my family asks for it?,"
To preface this, both my parents are immigrants turned US citizens. Both of them didn’t receive any education past high school, and worked/work very hard even to this day.

With that being said, I grew up very differently from my American peers. Where most 4th graders were busy having birthday parties and trying to become student of the month, I was busy juggling homework, house work, and a new born baby while my parents worked. 
As I got older, the responsibilities increased.
On top of being a student, doing house chores , raising two toddlers, the burden of bills /money struggles also fell onto my plate. 
And before I knew it, I was so codependent on my family as they were with me that it was hard to even see a life outside of them. I didn’t do sports in high school because “who would watch the babies?” I didn’t go to sleepovers or hangout with friends because the babies needed me. I chose to go to the local community college , not to save money, not because I didn’t have any other schools I could’ve gone to, but because i knew the family couldn’t function without me. I had filled a role of a person who could and would be anything for my family. Mother, father, sister, chef, maid, chauffeur, student, whatever was needed and I never questioned it because that was how my life had always been. 
Going away to college and making friends outside of my sisters made me realize a life outside of my family was NORMAL and not selfish. 

It feels like I blinked and suddenly I’m not 16 anymore, 27 is looking me right in the face…and I have nothing. I dropped out of college to help my family financially, and I haven’t returned since. This year, I planned on trying to get back into school , I’m in a loving relationship and suddenly my parents are investing everything they have into a cannabis farm. 

They’re adults, cool. If that’s what they want to do, who am I to tell them no? 
They kept telling me to come visit , just to take a look around for a couple of weeks. 
Visiting became helping a bit, which moved into helping a lot, to BECOMING the help.
2 weeks became 3, and now 6 months because if I don’t help then everything fails and they lose all their money. 

I’m in a state of disbelief and have to ask other people…if my parents ask me to continue to help with this farm outside of the 6 months, am I the asshole to refuse and to move back home? 
I know they’ve done so much for me and my sisters, and they’ve worked hard to provide a decent life for us, and it would be amazing for them to be able to retire early, to be financially free…but fuck, I’m trying to live my life too.",Not the A-hole
AITA for overreacting after I found out my best friend dated my ex?,"Ex and I broke up because she’s been convincing me to send my parents to elderly care facility so I can move in with her. I don’t want that because I’m afraid they will be mistreated. We’ve been arguing non-stop about it, so I broke up with her as I can’t take the heat anymore.

Flash forward, I saw my best friend and ex hanging out through Tiktok. I knew they were close, so I just shrugged it off at first until I realized they were actually dating. I felt like my head exploded. I called my best friend and angrily asked him about it. Long story short, we had a heated argument about it, with him explaining we’re over and me accusing him of being a snake.

But after I calmed down, I realized my mistake. I mean, we’ve been over for almost a year. Who am I to demand? And it’s not like I want my ex back. I still love her, but her suggestion for what to do with my parents is a major deal-breaker for me. I just let my emotions control me.

So I called my best friend again and calmly asked him to meet up. He agreed. It was awkward at first, but we managed. I first apologized for my overreaction, but I asked him to answer my questions honestly. Well, most of my accusations are false except for one thing: he’s interested in her while we’re still dating. I froze but managed to calm myself right away. I told him to give her the love she deserved, as my way of saying I’m supporting their relationship. He drove me home after our talk, and we’re both in silence.

It has been a week since that encounter. Last night, I received an angry call from my ex. She’s angry because my best friend broke up with her. Apparently, my best friend said that he realized how fucked up what he did. I’m a really good friend to him, and I deserved better. So he broke up with her because he would rather lose her than ruin our friendship forever. My ex told me that I probably manipulated him to think that way as their relationship has been stable for the last three months.

I called my best friend, but he won’t answer my call. So I called another friend for some unbiased opinion, and he said I’m a jackass. Ex and I have been over for years, and my words were probably some sort of reverse psychology. I mean, it is not, but now that I think about it, maybe that’s how my best friend interpreted it?

I’m still trying to call him, but he still won’t answer. And now, I’m panicking because I feel like I ruined our friendship, and my ex’s new relationship.

AITA for causing my lab group to fail the class by giving them the wrong answers when they wouldn’t help with the labs?,"At the start of the school year we had to pick our lab groups, the teacher told us we would be with these groups all year so to choose wisely. Unfortunately I didn’t know anyone in the class and got stuck in the only group that had an opening. This group consisted of three other girls who are extremely obsessed with anime. When I say obsessed I mean they didnt talk about anything else and wore cosplay of their favorite characters or OCs to school sometimes. I don’t mind anime and watch a few myself, but this group was over the top. On top of this they were also really into hentai, which is basically squid porn. They constantly talked about it in graphic detail, but switched out some words with fruit names so the teacher wouldn’t realize what they were talking about from small snippets of conversation. I asked them to stop talking about it around me because it made me very uncomfortable. They told me to stop being immature and to just stop listening if I didn’t want to hear it, which is really hard to do when I am sitting a couple of feet away. They also laughed at me for being too immature to understand ”the beauty of the art form”. I thought of telling the teacher but I didn’t want to be labeled a snitch.

For the first couple of projects they were ok, but soon they started refusing to help with the labs so they could work on their art projects. One of them wrote fan fiction and the other two drew anime people. I tried to get them to help but they just wined and complained pleading that they needed to work on their “art” for their futures until I did the work myself and just told them the answers. They were all convinced that after high school they would move to Japan and create anime and manga. I did a couple of labs myself just to avoid confrontation, which is something I really hate.

I eventually got sick of this arrangement and started refusing to give them the answers. When I did this they would bug me in the halls and in other classes I had that they were also in. I finally just started giving them the wrong answers just to get them off my back. This satisfied them since they didn’t bother to check their grades. For all they knew they were making As of all of the labs. I just did the labs myself which I was fine with as long as they weren’t getting to mooch off of my work, but I still had to listen to their gross conversations.

In the end they realized what was going on near the end of the class, but it was too late for them to do anything about it. They failed Biology and had to take it again the next year. To make room for it in their schedules, they had to drop art which was devastating for them. They were furious with me, but couldn’t do anything about it.

I might be the ass here for letting it go so far that they totally failed the class. I could have told the teacher, but as I said earlier I didn’t want to be labeled a snitch by the class. I also could have just kept refusing to give them the answers, but I didn’t want to have them harassing me all day.",Not the A-hole
AITA for being mean to my mom about MLMs?,"My (16m) parents were lured into a multi-level marketing scheme by their friend about two years ago (when I was 14.) My dad is the sole earner and my mom is a housewife, relevant bc, you know how MLMs work. 

Back then I had no idea what an MLM was until I googled the company they were lured into and found out that it was an MLM and that MLMs were bad. I brought this up with my dad but he completely dismissed me and told me I was wrong using some weird logic that probably doesn't stand in real life. 

They kept on trying to peddle their stuff to friends and acquaintances for two years and I hated every moment of it and I was extremely embarrassed.

I stopped trying to talk to my dad about it because my relationship with him soured even more than it already had when I was 14 over the next two years and now I don't really feel comfortable having any sort of conversation with him. 

Although I'm not much better about my mom, for various reasons I still felt like expressing my distaste and dislike of their activities to her and I tried to do it as politely as I could, and I tried to express my frustrations at her taking such a risk. However she'd always victimize herself and paint herself as an innocent angel whenever I brought up her marketing and peddling activities and she'd say ""it's just your dad who does that stuff, I just use the products because they're great!"" 

Which is a flat out lie. For the last two years she's been subtly manipulating me to try and get me to use the stuff and tell my friends about it so that THEIR parents would be lured into the trap. She's done inappropriate things like offer a product to my home tutor (it's very common in my country to have a tutor at home, we're not well off) in the middle of a lesson and I was furious at her for trying to profit off my teacher, who is in his 60s, slightly out of touch, and didn't know any better.

As far as I can tell there's been insignificant profit off of it in two years and they stopped the activities sometime this year, although they even play that up as an ""advantage"" like they can pause whenever they want. 

So today I asked my mom if they've stopped and she started the same tirade. And I got kind of rude and started saying stuff like, the whole company is a fraud and scam, and how she shouldn't expect me to respect her when she makes decisions like these.

I've never been this rude or direct about my opinions on this before and she seemed kind of quivering and crestfallen. I feel kind of bad. It's like I talked shit about something someone was looking forward to and now that person is really sad.

WIBTA for shaving my head,"I (23 F) am blessed with healthy, beautiful, straight, dirty blonde hair that can take just about whatever I throw at it. On top of that, hairstyles are impermanent. Even if I do something with my hair that I absolutely hate, it's a matter of waiting for it to grow out or settle down again.

Because of this, hair has always been my main method of self expression. Hair is straightforward, it's flexible, and I can put as much or as little effort into it as I feel like on a given day. It's good stuff.

So, recently (meaning over the course of about 6 months), I'd been planning my most extreme haircut yet. I was growing out my hair to cut off and donate, then shave my head completely bald.

Problem is, I live with my mom (51), and she was NOT a fan of this idea (neither was my aunt (50s...?) (we'll call her Cindy), but we'll get to that).

Cindy and I were going to get our hair cut together, with her paying for us both. I didn't realize until about a week beforehand that neither she nor my mom knew about my plans. I had talked about it before, but apparently Mom thought I was just considering it and not actually going to go through with it?

Once that was clarified, and the three of us had a long conversation about it, I agreed to compromise by going in ""phases"", starting with a fairly short undercut, which is what I now have. Mostly, I just didn't want to talk about it anymore, and I also didn't want to ask my aunt to pay for something she wasn't comfortable with.

Now, my mom is saying I cannot get my head shaved at all, ever. This is upsetting to me, both because I really had my heart set on it and it's pretty important to me, and also because that isn't what I initially agreed to. I've expressed this, but we haven't really sat down and talked about it. So here's where I might be an asshole:

Her, my dad (53), and my sister (25) are going on a trip starting tomorrow, and will be gone for a few days. I'm heavily considering taking the ""ask forgiveness"" approach and going to get it done while they're gone, so no one can stop me.

This will ABSOLUTELY upset my mom, but for the first time in my life, I want this badly enough that it kinda seems worth it. At the same time, her and I have never had a conflict like this before, so I'm very out of my element and debating whether this is really the hill I want to die on. On top of that, I'm debating whether I should sit her down first, try one more time to convey how badly I want this, and give her a chance to come around. She's difficult to talk to when she's busy rushing around planning and preparing something, and on top of that, I'll admit, I'm kind of a coward, and this is the first time I've felt inspired to consistently assert myself over something.

Anyways, if more details or any clarifications are needed, feel free to ask. The main question remains: WIBTA if I went and shaved my head behind my mom's back?

EDIT: Just wanted to clarify something, since a couple people seem confused. I already donated the hair (12 inches, by the way! Not too shabby!). The haircut I ended up with after that is what I said in the post, the short undercut. This was supposed to be a step towards going fully bald, but currently, I still have this undercut.",Not the A-hole
AITA because I snitched on my coworker for putting an old woman's teeth in on the job?,"I work with the elderly, medical care as well as basic caregiving duties with a dementia and Alzheimers provider. I'm very very good at my job, so head office often sends new hires to me for me to train them on how to do the job. 

I was sent a new girl, looked about 30 years old. I'll call her ""Shelby"". She claimed that I ""didn't need to train her"" because she had ""done this kind of work before for two years with another company"".

Since she would be with me for a week anyways, I just said okay, and decided to only supervise for the first day so I can assess how well she does on her own. If she needed further guidance, I'd step in and start her training properly. 

Everything seemed to go well enough. She needed to be reminded of certain feeding times and diaper changes, but otherwise did well. At the end of the day, it was time to remove and clean Patient A's dentures. I allowed Shelby to do it on her own, but I decided to go back and check on her at the sink. (Dental hygeine is very important).   When I found her, she had Patient A's dentures in her mouth, and was laughing and said ""hey look at me I'm 80 years old and a raging b!tch"". (Patient A is notoriously mean to unfamiliar people).

She must have noticed I was in shock because she quickly said, ""I already cleaned them!"". She then took them out of her mouth, and proceeded to clean them again while I watched. I made her sanitize them entirely. 

Afterwards she came up to me and said, ""hey that was just a joke I'm sorry. No harm done right? I made sure I sanitized them really well"". And I said something like ""it wasn't funny, knock that sh!t off."".

I immediately told head office about the incident, and they are apparently now reconsidering her for the position. She has my phone number because we coordinate for different files, so she texted me and let loose on how I'm a horrible person, and how I have no sense of humor and am threatening her job. She asked if I believe in god, because I'm evil for threatening the job of a single mother trying to support her family, and how she was going to never do it again and I didn't even give her a chance. Now I do feel a little guilty because it's true, I have a ""one strike you're out"" policy when it threatens the health of my patients. But I'm wondering if that's too harsh and she deserves a second chance. 

TLDR;  My coworker made a ""joke"" by putting my dementia patient's dentures in her mouth and insulting the patient in private. She sanitized them afterwards and apologized, but I still snitched on her. She now is questioning my morals because she's a single mother who needs the income.",Not the A-hole

WIBTA for kicking my roommate out?,"So, I moved in with this roommate a while ago, I was moving to a new state for work and they already lived there so it seemed win win to get a place together for lower rent. We were previously good friends before this, I never expected anything but good vibes.

RM never does chores, pays for food, cleans or takes out the trash. I've asked them to do these things but, nothing. RM at least pays rent, internet and so on. I could handle the food bill mostly.

The breaking point was something recent. We usually have a friend around to party. I started to have feelings for Friend and was hoping to start some form of a relationship because the feeling seemed mutual. I told RM about this because I trusted them. After I went to bed, I found out that RM tried to (and nearly did) sleep with Friend.

They're their own people, so I am not mad at Friend, but it hurt a little as RM did this knowing my feelings for Friend. They also told a mutual friend that they aren't going to stop anytime soon.

This kind of hurt me, on a friendship level. As I talked to friends about it, I began to realise more things that RM did that made me uncomfortable that I had just brushed off after they didn't stop when asked.

RM never apologises for anything even when it's deeply hurtful, often drives away new friends by being rude to them, will borrow money and not give it back, constantly makes you sacrifice things for them but will never do so themself.

RM also has a huge temper and will get mad at anything, even if it's as small as grubhub forgetting something. This has made them stomp around the house before. 

There's more but without identifying myself (RM is a big reddit user) I can't really say.

I'm planning on giving RM a month to find another place, because living with them makes me constantly on edge. 

WIBTA?

Edit: I don't sublease. We're joint tenants, along with another roommate who is also uncomfortable with RM. We pay the majority bills, rent ect.
I know now I can't give notice and such, thank you, but I probably will ask RM to find another place or try to find one myself, I'll talk with my landlord too to see if there is anything that can be done.",Not the A-hole
AITA for making the loser eat natto after loosing a bet?,"Recently, my coworkers and I had a bet going on about the England vs. Italy match.  We're all Americans who love soccer.  There are six of us involved in the bet: two are white, one is Mexican, two are Asian (one is Japanese, me, and the other is Korean), and one is of biracial (Asian mom, black dad).  

We decided that the loser would eat natto (fermented soybeans) if their team lost.  I grew up eating the stuff, and while it's considered a beloved food staple in the old country... it smells nasty.  

That losing team would end up to be England, so the losers (me, one of the white guys, the Mexican guy, and the biracial girl) all had to eat natto dishes for lunch earlier today.

Only one of our coworkers (who had nothing to do with our wager) got offended by what we were doing and reported it to HR.  So before lunch, we had to have a sit down with Sheryl about inappropriate workplace actions.  Including ""culturally appropriating food as a punishment"" (her actual words, I swear to the gods). Apparently, the coworker thought that we were being culturally insensitive towards the Japanese by making fun of a delicacy.

Again, I'm Japanese and this is a staple food like bread or beans everywhere else in the world.  It's not a delicacy. I can buy a four pack for two bucks at Tokyo Central. 

Sheryl wouldn't have any of it and told us to apologize and swear we never do it again.  We're mad at the coworker for ratting us out, while the rest of our workplace is split.  Most of us are on our side and rest think she is right and that we shouldn't use a foreign food as a humiliation for loosing a bet.

I don't think I'm being the asshole, especially since the humiliation was my idea and I am totally cool with everyone eating natto.  But this is America and I need a second opinion.",Not the A-hole

Today I had a shit day (dental surgery) and will be recovering for the next week. I was planning on working on the puzzle a lot for that time. Today my mom started trying to help, and I asked her not to as I wanted to do it alone. I offered to move it back into an unused room so it was out of her way as well.

WIBTA if I didn't call my gma before she died,"I (27m) have never had any substantive relationship with my maternal gma. Although it was never a bad relationship it can most accurately be described as non-existent. She never made any effort to call me or my sister before, never showed up to any milestones in my life (she does have MS but didn't make any seeming effort to watch or support us), nor played any important role in how I was raised. Now my mom wants me to call her as she is going to a nursing home to die (bleak, I know). I don't really want to call her because 1) she was not nice to my mom who I love a great deal and 2) I feel like we have nothing to talk about and, at this point, it would be an awkward 5 minute conversation that would make me feel really weird as it would basically be a final goodbye as I live across the country from her. I've always bristled at my mom asking me to call because I think it's unfair that the grandchild is the one who should be the one who has to invest in their relationship with their grandparent and not the other way around. In the same vein, it feels like I would basically be calling a stranger to ask how they're doing.

The only real reason I'm considering calling is that my mom wants me to and I would feel bad if my mom knew I didn't call. I don't think I would regret not calling, but I'm interested in hearing what the people of Reddit thought.

I on the other hand have decent credit, and my parents have been asking me to co-sign so that they have a better chance at getting approved. The thing is: I don't want to.

AITA for asking money for a bag from my sister?,"Recently I(24F) splurged on a set of gym bags for myself. My mom saw the yoga bag, fell in love and raced to get it. Some time after my sister noticed it and asked where to get it, but at that point it was already sold out. She was kinda bummed out. 

I tried to take the yoga bag out a couple of times and came to a conclusion it's a too big for my normal gym things, but I was hesitant to return it because I liked the design so much, even if I felt guilty for wasting so much money for something I will use infrequently. 

This Monday I was in especially good mood as mom did a very nice thing for me, so I thought I'd do something nice to my sister in return - I'd offer her to buy the bag she liked so much off of me. She takes a lot of stuff to the gym so she'd make an excellent use of the bag.

I texted her with the offer which she answered with that she wants to make sure her things fit but it's inconvenient for her to come to my home so *I* should bring it to her place instead myself. I was kinda aggravated at the tone but decided to play it down and joked that I don't offer a same day delivery and if she wants she can either meet me at the gym we frequent or some other location halfway or even try it at mom's place as she has literally the same bag. Which she answered that again *I* should call mom, explain everything and arrange for her to be able to lend the bag for a day. It sounded simply ridiculous(why she won't do so herself??) so I lost my temper and refused.

She said she won't be buying ""cat in the bag"" (no pun intended) then and if I really wanted to get rid of it then I should have either offered it for free or delivered it to her to try out.

I felt very offended as she made it sound like I tried to trick her for money so I explained my thinking to her and how I wanted to do a nice thing, but she reiterated that if i was serious about it then I should have brought it to her to try or would not have charged her. 

I'm not gonna lie, I thought it would be nice to get some cash back as this bag was the most expensive in the set, but I thought it is just a good deal for everyone involved - she won't have to hunt down and buy the whole set, the bag would be useful and I get some money back. But this whole confrontation left a bad taste in my mouth and I'm not even happy about owning the bag anymore. Maybe I should have just gifted it??? Was this really cheap of me??

AITA for Yelling at My Mom?,"For context, my parents signed me (f) up for a softball league that is funded and managed by the district. This means that all the girls on my team already knew each other from school. I go to a private school in another town so I had never met them before. When my parents signed me up they somehow thought I would immediately become best friends with these girls and I didn't. We are friendly and polite. But, we don't talk much and I don't see them at all outside of games/practice. I have social anxiety and my parents have always tried to ignore that and they always say things like ""you're just shy!"" or ""you need to make more of an effort"".

So, when my birthday was the same day as practice my parents decided to throw a small celebration afterwards (because of Covid). I have always hated birthdays and all the attention and I constantly tell my parents this. However they never seem to care and just throw big surprise party's, and then they expect me to be grateful and super excited even though I hate it. Anyways we were going to softball and I notice my dad bringing cupcakes, candles, decorations, etc. I instantly realize what was going on and after he got my mom on the phone I practically begged them not to do it. They just said I'm being dramatic and that they were doing it anyways. So I just went to softball practice and at the end my parents (my mom just got there from work) walked towards everyone on my team and started the celebration. Immediately after they got the balloons and candles lit they started encouraging everyone to sing. I just stood there until they were done singing and started eating their cupcakes before I slowly and quietly made my way to the car (the celebration was in the parking lot and the car was right next to all the people).

When my mom got in the car she started yelling at me that I embarrassed her in front of everyone, was rude, that it wasn't about me, and that I slammed the car door (I didn't no one even looked up). I got really upset at her and started yelling that she never listened to me and that she wanted everything to be about herself. I felt bad afterwards and once we got home my dad told me that they knew best and if I wouldn't have gone to the car I would be happy. I know she didn't mean to make me upset, she just wanted me to make friends, and I was TA for yelling at her.

AITA for not doing my schoolwork after nearly dying from a kidney infection?,"TLDR: Kidney infection almost killed me and I was unfit to do my schoolwork, but my dad really wanted me to anyways. He got mad at me and called me a lazy asshole, and now I feel sort of bad.

A little while ago, I (17F) had a life-threatening kidney infection that reached my bloodstream so I was hospitalized for a week. 
My father (50) took me to the hospital. The day that this happened also happened to be my father’s birthday.
On our second day in the hospital, I was able to stay awake for longer than a few minutes so I was able to watch some shows on my phone to keep myself occupied. However, I was still in a lot of pain and was really messed up from all of the medication that I was on.
My father said that if I was ok enough to watch videos, I could do my schoolwork. I told him that I already had plans to drop the course that I was taking and that I could barely move enough to type, so I didn’t think that doing my work was a good idea. He started yelling at me and calling me lazy and saying that he took time out of his day to take me to the hospital, so I owed it to him. 
I told him that he was being unfair, and that he was too controlling to even cut me some slack while trying to recover from literal sepsis.
He seemed to be getting really angry, so I tried to stand up and leave the room to give both of us some space. I kinda failed and ended up falling over in pain, so I called a nurse while my dad just sat there.
He called me an ungrateful little brat and started knocking things off the table next to him. He then blamed me for ruining his birthday and said that he won’t forget how I embarrassed him in front of the nurses. He stormed out of the hospital and called my mom to come stay with me instead because he “couldn’t deal with me”
I can’t help but feel bad somehow, and my dad really thinks I’m an asshole for this since he sent me an angry paragraph over text a few hours after he left.

AITA to change the amount of money I promise the sister,"Note: I am not a legal expert. I may have used some words incorrectly. ESL. On mobile. ASL may have changed to protect privacy. Also still use present tense mostly.

My best friend of 30 years just passed away. She and I are like sisters. 

I know she isn't close to her family.  She tells me they don't understand her.

I always know she loves me but I never reciprocate her feelings. I am not gay but I don't really care. She is still my best friend.

A month ago, she was hit by a car. Needless to say, I was distraught. The police told me that they found my name and phone number were in her purse as emergency contact. 

The police wouldn't tell me anything about her because I am not next of kin. All the police wanted was the phone number of her family.

 I remembered she has given me a folder with some of her documents in it. She has given me her power of attorney. I didn't pay attention that time because we were still young. I opened the folder. There were a bunch of documents and her will.

Since her family and she were not closed, I told them if they have any question about my friend they could ask me. So far, radio silent.

When I first met her family, I thought of them as an extension of my friend. I knew my friend left them the bare minimum in her will so that they couldn't contest her will. No surprise，she left most of her money to me. I told her sister that I would double her portion of her money as indicated in the will. At that time, she and her sister look alike and I couldn't help feeling close to her. But now, she doesn't seem interested to learn about her sister. The only time she reached out was about her sister's belongings and the money. I regretted my decision to double her money. Now I know my friend would never want her sister to get more money than what was indicated in the will.

AITA for giving my flatmate an ultimatum of 'Pay your rent or move out within the week'? He owes 2 months rent currently and I cannot afford to cover his half again.,"I moved in with my flatmate 2 years ago this August. He paid nothing towards moving in or any rent at all until the October but gradually paid back most of the costs I had incurred by July last year. But he only paid any back at all because I had made a mistake on how much the utilities bills were and he had been overpaying a small amount that built up over the year. Once I told him about the overpayment he has since not paid anything towards the remaining amount owed, which was a couple hundred quid at the time.

But for the past 2 months, he hasn't paid any rent at all and now owes close to 1K, including the initial debt from 2 years ago.

He has changed employment recently and said there were issues getting paid and that he would be on monthly pay. I made allowances for that as I understand new jobs and pay issues can arise and covered his rent on the proviso it would be repaid once he got paid, naturally. 6 weeks went by and no job in the UK messes you about for that long. I could cover the first month without too much problem, just tightened my budget. But with no payment again last month either I had to take out a small payday loan and borrow some money from a friend to cover everything. 

I found out yesterday that he has been on weekly pay since he started at this new job and basically just hasn't been paying anything out of choice and lying about pay issues. He has consistently been drinking, smoking, buying takeaways and having weekends away with his friends and girlfriend yet always claimed to have no money. 

I told him that he needs to pay towards rent weekly, to cover what he owes me and towards the next rent due in 2 weeks, my payment plan I gave him clears his debt to me by October and has him just paying rent by November. I've said if he doesn't pay each week, he needs to move out that week so I can get someone else in to pay the costs as I cannot afford it alone and have my own debts to deal with. I live a very frugal lifestyle and have sacrificed many hobbies and events in order to ensure my bills are paid.

I understand people can get into trouble financially, my own issues testament. But he's saying I'm being unfair for requesting pay every week and that he can't afford it, yet what I'm asking for is basically just the rent and a small amount on top to repay what he owes me. 

I want to move out as soon as his debt is paid off and can't afford to do so until this happens. I feel like I'm trapped with him at this point.

"AITA For ""snitching"" on co-worker/friend","I work as document management for a medium company thanks to a friend (call them Sam). Said friend has been messing up many times and I happen to be one of the people to catch it. They have incorrectly put out documents, materials, etc...within the system that we're working in and other co-workers would either fix it themselves or let them know that they did it wrong and Sam would fix it. I have done that multiple times with some of the documents but it seems Sam is never learning from their mistakes. Also the fact that we now have a quality check implemented so that someone else on the team can check it before we release it. But they has been skipping that and then later we find their mistakes.

There was recently an incident where multiple co-workers did the same incorrect thing on the same day and I had to go to my boss to fix the first co-worker's issue because it was something bigger than what I or my co-worker could do. And then to find that Sam basically did the same thing but a month ago and I just happened to find it. Therefore, I went to my boss again; however, I didn't mention it to Sam first. I figured this issue isn't a new event and we need preventative measures to fix it, using these two documents as examples and to why this needs to be fixed. But this at the same time notified my boss that Sam had messed up and this isn't the first time. Another co-worker says I should have gone to Sam first and have him fix it and now Sam might get fired because, as stated before, this isn't his first strike.

The issue turned out to be done by a simple mistake; however, I keep seeing these simple mistakes too often and they, in reality, are much bigger problems especially since many of these issues can be compliance issues and there's going to be an audit in the coming months.

AITA for telling my wife that her hair looks terrible?,"For context to my post, my and I are both 38, we have been married for 10 years and together for 13 years. About 3 years ago my wife noticed she had a few gray hairs. Her hairstylist dyed my wife's hair blonde and put some very big highlights in. My wife says the big highlights hide the grays from her fresh not dyed roots where it grows. She also had her hairstylist cut it, give her bangs and cut the hair around her face shorter because it would hide wrinkles. I never noticed my wife having wrinkles but she said she did. The new hairstyle was a big change because before her hair was a bit longer, black and she didn't have any bangs or short parts. Personally I think the blonde doesn't look right on her at all, the highlights aren't natural and if I were her I would not have bangs. But she likes it and it makes her more confident so if she is happy it's enough for me.

My question comes about because my wife's best friend is getting a divorce and it is not a pleasant one. She goes to the same place as my wife to get her hair done. She told my wife her ex-husband said she wasn't as hot as when they got married and made a bunch of general insults about her looks and her hair. After this happened my wife started asking me if I'm still attracted to her. I said yes. She asked if I liked her hair. I said it makes her happy so I do. But she kept asking me if I liked it. I don't know why it started after 3 years and the questions about her looks and her hair kept going. Especially after she had a virtual book club and wine night with her friends.

She kept asking me and my answer was always the same. One night she asked me to swear on our daughter's life. Which was ridiculous for something so minor. But since she wouldn't stop I admitted I preferred her old hair color and style without layering or bangs, but I also said if it makes her happy it's enough for me and a different hairstyle isn't going to change my attraction to her. She is upset with me over that answer. She has called me an asshole to my face. She told her friends I insulted her hair (which I did not). She even asked me if I would prefer her sister now because she has black hair but does not dye it or cut it like my wife. I don't know where that came from, her sister is gay and lives in another country. She is perfectly nice but that's it. I've never thought of her like that.

Should I have lied when my wife asked me to swear on our daughter's life about her hair? Am I wrong for not understanding why hiding gray hair is so important for women? Am I the asshole for saying I preferred her old hair when she kept asking me and should I apologize? If I was truly wrong I would apologize for the misunderstanding. I do love my wife and I hate that she's mad at me over hair.",Not the A-hole
AITA for being angry at my dad kicking me out?,"I (24f) moved back to my home country after my mom(59f) was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  I basically took care of her amd my dad's house, cooked most of the meals, and drove her to appointments when needed.  I didn't work to focus on her and keeping her life as stressfree as possible.   Six months later, she passed and I spent six months continuing to keep the house in shape for my dad (59m) so he could focus on healing (he lost his wife of almost 40 years, and within the year also lost his mom and dog) and his job.  My brother lived in town but he had a baby with his wife so he couldn't help much.  My parents didn't charge me rent and gave me a small allowance for, quote, ""keeping things smooth.""  My dad met his current wife(48f) about 6 months after my mom passed.  About 8 months later, my dad announced his gf was moving into the house at a meal with my brother and sister in law, and basically told me to move out.  I was gobsmacked; he had never talked to my brother or I about the new then-gf moving in and the implication was heavily ""you need to move out.""   At this point I had been jobless for almost 2 years in my 20s in a not great job market.  When I told my dad it hurt me that he didn't consult me about this at all, he just shruged and said since it was his house he didnt have to discuss it with me.  While, yes, true, I spend 14 months of the years I should have used to establish my career making sure he didn't drink himself to death.  I did find a temp job and a friend with a spare room, but the whole ""I had no obligation to discuss this with you"" rubbed me the wrong way.  I'm not saying I would have stayed or that my opinion would have swayed him, but a discussion to show that he appreciated what I did would have been nice.  I could have left as soon as my mom passed, leaving him alone (He's not good alone, he needs to be around people).

So AITA for telling my dad he hurt me by kicking me out of his house when I was the only person who helped him through his grief?  He did see a grief counselor, and I went to a join session with him where the goal was to clearly make me not feel animosity toward the decision.  It's been a few years and I still find it so hard to forget whhat happened  I've told my brother my dad does not want me to pick my dad's retirement home/if he gets sick I'm not putting my life on hold again for him.  I know I was an adult at the time but it still feel raw, even after individual counseling.

AITA for telling a brand new acquaintance to stop oversharing?,"A good friend of mine invited me out to brunch with another friend of hers (""Jen"") who I had never met before. I was excited to meet Jen since my friend had told me a lot about her and it sounded like we could be buds.

Very early on in the conversation Jen started telling me things that felt like overshares or even trauma dumping. She looked me in the eye very seriously and told me unsolicited that she had slept with so many guys that she couldn't even keep track anymore...not in a bragging tone but a grave one, like it was something bad that she was confessing to me. She also told me that she doesn't speak to either of her parents anymore, that her sister has a baby that she's never met and doesn't even know its name, that she got pregnant from a guy who gave her a fake number and then had a miscarriage, that she has always felt excluded from things since she was a child and she was glad that my friend and I had invited her to brunch—and then asked us to confirm that we were happy to have brunch with her.

My friend didn't really respond much as she was dumping all of this on me and when Jen asked us to tell her that we were happy to have brunch with her, my friend was just like ""Of course!"" But I was feeling incredibly uncomfortable at this point, not just because she had dumped all of this stuff but because she interjected it out of nowhere when we were talking about normal things. So I looked at Jen and I said ""Honestly, I just met you and you are being a bit much. Could you not blurt out all of your private thoughts? It's very uncomfortable."" Not exactly as well-put as that just because I kind of stammered it out, but that's what I said. Jen got really quiet and didn't respond. The awkwardness just continued to escalate because she took on this dour look and refused to say anything, so within a few minutes I told my friend I was going to call it a day and we could talk later, and I left.

My friend texted me after and said that she understood where I was coming from but that I really hurt Jen's feelings by admonishing her in public, that she had been through a lot of trauma and that's just how she was and I could have been much more gentle with her. I am not really in a place where I'm willing to be someone's emotional crutch right now so I'd honestly rather just not meet up with Jen again. I feel bad for hurting her feelings but I don't know if I really said anything wrong.",Not the A-hole
AITA for sitting in the front seat of the car?,"This is a bit dumb of a story but here it goes. 
Today my sibling, mother, and I went on a car ride to a big city. While in the city and returning to the car to drive elsewhere, I sat in the front seat of the car. I meet all the requirements, and I like to look around so why not? This is where everything happens. My sibling insists I get out and let them sit there on account of it being all of the following: “an unwritten rule, they’re the eldest, I sit in the front seat when my dad drives, etc, etc.” this was not all at once, as the conversation turned debate turned argument lasted about ten minutes. The main reason for me not being allowed to sit in the front seat was that I wasn’t the oldest. I feel like this is dumb, as I have zero control over that fact. I hadn’t sat in the front of the car on the hour long car ride to said city, and this was a ten minute drive, and if I got off the seat I wouldn’t be allowed to sit there on account of the sibling stopping me. My mother also took my sibling’s side saying that they were the eldest and therefore were allowed the seat or something along those lines.  Should I have just moved instead of staying in the seat?

AITA For refusing to help my out of work father?,"All my life (all my father's life, for that matter), my father has spent his time relying on others to support him through his inability to stay at/find a job.  His mother supported him until she passed in his 30's, then his grandmother took it up and supported him even after she passed.  He spent most of my childhood unemployed due to no one putting their foot down and making him work for a living.  When my grandmother passed, he received a very large inheritance and spent the next five or so years unemployed, squandering away that inheritance on ridiculous, unnecessary items (two new motorcycles, several hot tubs, a pool table, and so on) all while arguing with my mom that she was responsible for all of the bills/food/housing costs whenever she asked for assistance.

Once that inheritance was spent, my mom took on the responsibility of applying for jobs and financial assistance for my father.  About 5 years ago, she finally had enough (after over 30 years of dealing with his bullshit) and finally left him.

The burden of helping my father find a job, housing, etc then went to my siblings and I, but it quickly became obvious that he was just falling into the same pattern of abuse and was now expecting us to do everything for him.  I pay for cellphone service for him and I put together a resume for him, set up an email address and Indeed account and made it incredibly easy for him to do this on his own.  He still refused to do it on his own, so between my older sister and I, we started applying for jobs and scheduling interviews, loaned him money he'll never be able to pay back, and so on.  My younger brother helped him out by getting him a job at the plumbing company he works at, and he lasted all of three months before he quit because he didn't want to deal with the commute.

Back to square one, my sister has been handling applying for jobs and setting up interviews and my father just keeps blowing them off, offering up lame excuses, flat out ignoring phone calls, and even deciding to go camping for an entire week without telling anyone instead.  While this is going on, my sister has been pleading with me to help out and I have refused.  I flat out told her that it's not worth the time or worrying that he has caused and for all I care, he can become homeless because he's clearly shown that he has the expectation that someone else will do everything for him.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not paying my ex bf phone bill?,"my (f24) bf (m22) have been together for 3 years. He has lived with his mom for most of this time and he has not held a job for longer than two weeks, stating he doesn’t want to work. 
His phone bill and car insurance, gas, food, necessities and wants have been paid by either his mom or myself (mostly myself). 

Seven months ago his mom kicked him out and he has moved in with me. I have paid his bills a few times but I also have bills and can’t keep paying it, therefore his phone service has been turned off and the bill is $190 right now. 

Since moving in, the relationship has gotten physically, mentally, verbally, emotionally and financially abusive and I finally decided to ask him to move out because it’s best for everyone. He is wanting me to pay the $190 before I kick him out so he can have a working phone to DoorDash for money.

Because he has had such a long history of not working and expecting others to take care of him, my own financial hardships and because of the abusive parts of our relationship I don’t really want to pay the phone bill, but I also feel guilty because he doesn’t have anywhere to go once he’s out so maybe that’s the least I could do.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my sister she can’t go with me on vacation?,"Last weekend while at my parents with my siblings, my dad and I were looking at a few locations where I might take a week solo trip.  One of my sisters walks in and overheard me mentioning wanting to go to a lake.  She then says “Oh, how about you and I go to the beach?!  I haven’t gone to the ocean in YEARS!”  I tell her that maybe one day when her kids are older we can go (she has 7m and 5m) but until then, this will be a very much needed solo trip.  She goes off about how she wished I knew how hard and expensive it was to have kids as a single mom.  That she really needed a break and couldn’t afford a week off with just her income and needed help with the kids.  I reminded her that not only could I not have kids (medical reasons) but Ive also helped ALL  of my siblings at one time or another financially with their children as well as childcare when needed (for free) and if she’s single it’s because of her horrible choice of men (her ex is a douche).  She went crying to my mom, so now my mom is taking her side.  My dad is taking my side since he knows I work hard for my money and I don’t really don’t splurge on myself.  Plus I haven’t been able to take a vacation in almost 2 years.
Edit to post-I normally would keep my cool and not be bothered by what she said, but the fact that she made it sound like I didn’t have kids by choice really hurt.  A little over ten years ago I almost didn’t survive a tubal pregnancy. My ex refuse to take my pain seriously.  I drove myself to the ER, had to have emergency surgery and ended up having an ovary removed.  I’ve always wanted to me a mom, she’s known this and yet did what she said.  But I should have not said what I did and instead should have told her to stop and not bothered with it.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA for not being 100% honest to vendors about the type of party they’d be providing services for?,"So, I get frustrated with the wedding industry in the US. I am against buying new diamonds for engagement rings. I think it’s immoral that wedding vendors (like caterers, venues, bakeries, florists, etc.) often bump up their prices to a ridiculous amount when someone mentions that the product their purchasing is for a wedding rather than a regular party. Like, sure if you’re dealing with bridezilla who’s being super picky and extra and asking for tons of extra frills, yeah, charge extra. But if I just want like, a basic cake that’s basically the same as all your other cakes or a couple vases of flowers for the tables that are the same as flower arrangements you might make for a classy birthday party or New Years Eve party, why should I be paying 200% more?

My (25f) boyfriend (25m) and I recently moved in together and have started talking about our general opinions and plans for our future. We’ve talked about kids, timelines, places we’d like to live, future career goals, and of course wedding stuff. We recently found out my ring size so things are moving forward. I mentioned to him that I would want a New Years Eve wedding with him (because NYE is when we first got together and it’s a special night for both of us) and he agrees that that would be perfect. 

I also mentioned that a NYE wedding would probably be wildly expensive so I think we should plan it as a NYE party, aka book the venue for a classy NYE party, get a caterer *for a NYE party*, get floral arrangements *for a NYE party,* etc so they don’t all up charge us just because it’s a wedding. He told me that was a fucked up idea and he’s not ok with scamming people. I don’t see it as a scam because we’d be paying whatever price we were charged for the services we’re getting and I *do* want our reception to feel like a lit New Years Eve party rather than a traditional wedding reception (as does he.) 

IMO why does the purpose of the party really matter to the people we are getting the flowers or food from when we don’t want it to be anything more exceptional than a nice NYE party? But he feels that omitting the fact that it is technically for a wedding reception is lying and immoral, and I can see where he’s coming from. Now whenever I try to bring up the topic, he gets mad and shuts down the conversation. AITA?

TLDR: I want to save money on wedding reception services by planning our reception as a New Years Eve party and not tell vendors that it’s technically a wedding reception. My bf thinks that’s unethical and sees it as “scamming” the vendors. AITA?

Edit: Thank you to everyone who has commented their judgments and opinions. Even though the official voting period isn’t over, I realized that I WBTA so I won’t be doing this. Luckily I won’t be getting married for years so i have plenty of time to save money, do my research, and plan appropriately, I (stupidly) didn’t realize how much coordination goes into a wedding, even a small one. 

Thank you to everyone who have given me great ideas and suggestions (like using Sam’s Club for flowers, doing a court house wedding than NYE party after to celebrate, and researching vendors and only going with those who don’t apply the wedding tax). I will definitely be looking into all those options when the time comes! 

Thank you to everyone who helped educate me on *why* wedding receptions are more expensive than regular events (flowers that don’t wilt by the end of the night, more durable hair and make up, more coordination of food coming out all at once, etc). I do see the bigger picture now and I understand the process so much more than I did before. 

To those who said my parents will be paying for my wedding or my life, they won’t, but that’s ok. To anyone who accused me of being bridezilla, I’m sorry if I came off that way and I see how a lot of what I said in this post came off poorly and contradicted my intentions. To those who said I was expecting free stuff, I don’t at all and my SO and I do have a fairly decent amount saved up for this event, so we are very excited that we’re able to start thinking about these details. To those who said they see why my SO wants to leave me or that our relationship is doomed, thanks for your opinion, but I don’t think he agrees. I will be apologizing to my SO and letting him know that I was in the wrong and was naive to even suggest that in the first place.",Asshole
AITA for offering my parents’ money to cover my bf’s vet bills?,"My boyfriend (28) and I (27) have been dating for a little over a year. He is a sweet, smart, funny, hardworking person who treats me well, and I adore him.

One of the things we originally bonded over was our mutual love of dogs. We both owned a dog when we met, but sadly mine was a rescued senior and fell sick a few months after we started dating. She went from perfectly healthy to needing to be put to sleep within a month due to a very aggressive cancer. I tried everything, but unfortunately it was unsuccessful. I was traumatized and devastated (he was my first ever pet and it happened so suddenly!) but BF was super supportive.

Now HIS dog got sick, and needs an expensive surgery. BF is understandably distressed, both about the dog and the cost. BF comes from a solidly middle-class family and does okay for himself, but not so well that this wouldn’t be a SIGNIFICANT financial stressor for him. He’s not quite paycheck to paycheck, but this surgery is several months’ rent in one of the most expensive cities in the US (see: rent fatigue). I love his dog too and it hurts to see both of them in pain.

My parents are very wealthy. My dad basically Won At Capitalism and retired in his mid-30s after starting a successful company. My dad was a fantastic provider, but when I was a child, distant at best and emotionally abusive at worst. He is on the autistic spectrum, and providing financially/acts of service has always been the easiest/preferred love language for him. He is very generous with me.

When my parents heard about it, they immediately offered (to me) to foot the bill. BF refused. However it’s causing him so much stress that he’s angsty and frustrated and upset basically all the time now and has started overworking himself (he works freelance in a demanding field and he’s not sleeping, eating poorly) and it’s tanking his mental health and, by extension, aspects of our relationship. This money would not be significant at all to my parents.

I tried to be supportive but I hate the idea that he’s doing this to himself when it could be entirely avoidable, and one day after he was venting again I got frustrated and asked “is your pride really more important than your dog or your mental health?” and he responded that ""you can't understand, not everyone is as spoiled as you are"" (I don’t necessarily disagree with either of these…)

I know I’m spoiled… I know I’m lucky… I know I will never truly understand what it’s like to not have a hefty safety net. I do my best not to flash this around. One of my friends said that it was offensive/emasculating that I offered. I think this is stupid… am I wrong? I acknowledge I have a skewed understanding of financial burdens because of my upbringing, but was this really a dick move??

TLDR AITA for being ignorant/offensive in offering my parents’ money to cover my bf’s vet bills?

EDIT: For clarification the dog is not suffering!! She is getting the surgery. BF is just putting himself in a bad place financially and mentally to do so. ",Not the A-hole
AITA for not quitting my job to help look after my son?,"Me (m33) and my wife (f25) became parents earlier this year to a beautiful baby boy. However this was not without difficulty. Our boy was a few weeks premature and was born with a heart problem that will require surgery. So due to this he has additional needs which are a lot to cope with. 
Over the last few months we've been trying to help him gain weight to be able to have his open heart surgery as the surgeons feel the risks are too great to do it when he's still quite small. The demands are quite a lot and our little boy needs constant monitoring to ensure his oxygen levels are sufficient. 
Unfortunately life doesn't wait around for this type of thing so I've still been going to work so that we can afford to keep up with bills and house payments. 
My wife however feels as if this is me trying to escape from responsibilities as a father, making out like I am not doing enough to look after our son. Yet when I'm at home I will change nappies, make bottles, play with him. I always make sure his medications are ready for when they are needed and I go downstairs at all hours of the night to make bottles fresh for him. She gives him his feeds as he prefers to take them from her. However he has started teething which has made bottlefeeding a little bit trickier. He's not taking as many feeds right now because of this which is disheartening as we are still trying to get his weight up. She wants me to quit my job to help out and do more, yet I feel like I do what I can with the time available while still bringing home an income that allows us to keep a roof over our head. Apparently this makes me a piece of shit. I've told her I won't quit my job. Am I the asshole?

TLDR: I'm refusing to quit my job to give my wife extra help with our baby boy

Update: it seems some people are thinking I'm leaving out info purposefully which I don't understand why anybody would think that but some people just love to think the worst of others for whatever reason I guess.
So here's a bit more info for you.

My wife is on maternity pay right now which runs out in a few months My job pays around £19500 a year so i get about 1400 a month after tax.

AITA for making jokes about my friend (f)?,"Kind of a short one.

So, in my friend zone we naturally have girls and boys. Some of the girls often like to make jokes about the boys penis size, saying how small it is.

Once when we were grilling together I took the biggest sausage we had and made that normal guy joke: ""this is almost as big as my wiener""
One of the girls then said to me, my big penis would only exist in my dreams.
I responded back saying the same, only about her breasts. Damn she got pissed.

AITA for telling my electrician to shut the door,"A little back story because I may well be out of line here because I don’t like this man. A few months ago I had an electrical fault in my house and it meant that none of the electrics in my kitchen and home office area would work. I was powering my fridge with extension cables plugged into other extension cables and it was unsafe. I told my landlady and she landlady booked an electrician. I got a family friend who is an electrician to have a look and he told me this will be a big job take tomorrow off work it’ll take a long time to fix. I booked the day off work and explained to his company that it’s a big job and it’s affecting my work and making my kitchen unable to be used so I would appreciate him coming sooner rather than later hoping it could be fixed that day. He turned up at 3pm and then realised it was a huge piece of work and he would come down the next week. This meant I was without electrics for 8 days in half of my house. His attitude stunk and he left a mess. He managed to fix the issue, albeit leaving a cantaloupe melon sized hole in the wall. I forgot all about him 

A month later my landlady contacts me to say that significant remedial works are required on the electrics in my house. I was annoyed. I had just taken 2 days off work for electrics, why had he not told me about it then? Why now? So I had to book a further 2 days off and he’s here now doing this work.

He’s currently in my porch. There’s a front door and then a door behind that leads into the living room. I asked him to shut the porch door because he’s got both the doors open. By shutting the porch door he can keep the front one open for light and air and space. He doesn’t need them both open. He asked why and I said “I’m really arachnophobic and I try to keep windows and doors shut” and explained that last time he came there were spiders in the house. I live alone. He became defensive about it and was like “I’ll stop this job right now if you want”. I said “I don’t want you to stop the job I just want you to try to keep the doors shut”. He said he can’t because he’s going in and out. When I’m in and out for example doing the recycling I shut the door behind me. 

Am I the asshole for asking him to keep the doors shut?

Edited to add: ok I don’t think I’m the asshole now. I fell asleep upstairs and woke up hours later. They have found the fault in the kitchen and yet he was stood outside with both doors open texting whilst his colleague is working in the kitchen. There’s no work left in the porch and they’ve got all the equipment in the kitchen. He’s just being a dick now.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA If I Asked For A Raise?,"I work at a doctors office and we recently had a nurse go on maternity leave. It's a relatively small office so this made us short staffed and required us to take on all of her work for what we thought was about 3 months of leave. We just found out, that for undisclosed reasons that she wont be coming back to work here once her leave is done, leaving us indefinitely short staffed and without a nurse.

Now I was perfectly fine stepping in to help out just while she was on leave because it was temporary and had a set end date. But now everything is up in the air in when we might get a nurse hired here as there is also a shortage apparently. So instead of 3 months, it's now however many months with no known end date. 

I personally feel like that I should get a raise or at least some form of compensation for doing the work of 2 people as well as work that isnt even supposed to be mine due to me not even being a nurse. Because instead of rooming patients and ordering new meds and bloodwork, I now room patients, order bloodwork, do all authorizations, medication fills, phone calls with pharmacies, insurance companies, and the nurse calls that come in to be triaged to the physicians, help set up serums to be made, aND train a new nurse for one of our other offices at the same time on everything I've been doing.

WIBTA if I kick my mom off of my credit card?,"Recently, I was approved for a credit card. It was on my mind for a while, since I was wanting to build up my credit to be able to move out and find my own place. With this credit card, I was able to add someone to my account, which would give them a credit card, but it would charge me if they used it, like a joint account. I thought I could do that with my mom, that way if she needs gas or to pay a bill that she doesn’t have enough money for, she could use my card, and I could pay it off, instead of me giving her a portion of my paycheck, like I had been. I told her this, and she was ok with it. I also made it very clear that this card would only be for bills, and NOTHING ELSE. I thought I would be able to trust her, but it turns out I was gonna regret it. 

Not even a week goes by, and I see a charge for $50 from the card she has. She spent it at a secondhand store, one of the types of stores I hate her going to because she tends to spend lots of money at those places. I confronted her about it, but she wasn’t even taking me seriously, saying “Oh come on. It’s only $50!” I knew I wasn’t going to get through to her, so I just warned her not to do it again. It became clear to me that she didn’t take me seriously or even listen to me, because the next thing I saw after that was a $220 charge from DD’s, another secondhand store. I was angry and asked her why, but she was being dismissive and dodged my question. Today, I keep seeing charges from Goodwill, Salvation Army, and more places where the charges were in between $80-$200. It’s becoming so often, that my spending limit went from being a couple thousand dollars to $300. My credit is suffering because of it, and all she can tell me is “Give me cash, like you did before.” I can’t even confront her about it without her telling me “What about you and your spending? You’re spending the same amount as me.” Which isn’t true. I only use my card for either Uber/Lyft or when I absolutely have to. 

I’m honestly thinking about shutting off her card, but I’d feeling guilty, since she is using it for bills, too.

AITA for letting my cat sleep out of my room for one night?,"I recently moved in with 2 male and female friends, they are a couple, initially we were neighbors but we decided to look for an apartment together, the contract has her name for endorsement reasons, since the move there have been small problems between the 3 of us, which I consider something expected in the end we are learning to live together only for 1 month. For a couple of days my cat has been angry with me because I scold him and scared him with a towel when he attacked one of the dogs that lives with us. Because of his anger and cat personality he decided to sleep outside last night and although I tried to put him in my room, he hid so I went to sleep, in the morning I found him behind the refrigerator and took him out. Everyrhing was normal until the afternoon when I received a message from her asking who moved the refrigerator and adding a photo that showed a small separation of the refrigerator with the wall, without seeing any major problem I admitted that it was me and gave my reasons without Knowing the storm that would fall on me, She began to stain that I should not leave it outside unattended (my cat has thrown things from high places) and that it was wrong, to which I said that it was not a constant theme since it was only one night and it was The cat's decision not my irresponsibility to leave it out, adding that I did not understand her annoyance or reason to mention it and make a problem, she began to accuse me of always seeking to justify myself and get defensive, she was increasingly angry, apparently for her when I admitted the fact that I moved the refrigerator i was making fun of her... and asking what was the problem with the cat sleeping one night outside the room was the maximum sign of irresponsibility (although she did not know that the cat slept out of the room  until I said so). While I was trying to tell her that I was speaking (writing by WA) calmly and that I was not arguing, she went on and on, I sent her a voice note so that through my voice she would realize that I was only responding, not fighting or annoying. When he finally bothered me, I told her that his attitude was beginning to annoy me, to which she replied ""Move out"" thus denying my emotions. When I got home and we spoke in person she insisted that I need to leave since the contract have her Name on it. I know I am Human and I can becwrong and I probably do not write the whole context here, but everything was triggered because my cat  slept outside and I can not find a reason why she acted and got angry that way for a thing of nothing.

AITA for talking about my tubal infront of my aunt,"So I (21f) had a bisalp (my Fallopian tubes removed) back in November completely by choice as I don’t want children. 

Because of covid my extended family hasn’t all gotten together in over a year until last week we had a backyard BBQ. We of course we’re all catching up on everything that happened and my one uncle mentioned how he’d recently had a vasectomy (he has 2 kids) and talked about his recovery time and how easy it was for him. 

So I brought up my surgery and we started comparing how differently our experiences were and this lead to the family asking me questions about why I had it, why I didn’t wait, what if I regret it, etc. And I was honest with them saying I never want children, pregnancy freaks me out and how I’d be a terrible parent anyways. 

Well unknown to anyone else but my mom, my aunt and her husband had been trying to get pregnant for nearly 3 years and were struggling. 

After we all left I went back to my parents to hangout and my mom said that it was really rude of me to talk about it infront of them and that I was “rubbing it in that I could have had kids but threw that away” and “why did I have to make a spectacle about my choices” and “I should think about what others are going through before running my mouth” in the end I was advised that from now on I should just keep my lifestyle to myself. 

So AITA for talking about my choice to get sterilized infront of my aunt and anyone’s else?

Edit: to clarify a few things, 

1. I haven’t had the chance to talk to my aunt and uncle about it yet. 

2. I have 3 other siblings, one of which has already had a kid. 

3. Part of my guilty feeling comes from the fact my mom was the one to help me the most after my surgery and for the most part seemed okay with my choice tho worried I’d regret it one day. Do for her to tell me I shouldn’t talk about it was complicated unexpected. 

4. I’m from Ontario Canada! I got really lucky with my gyn. He was the first dr I talked to about the possibility of getting the surgery when I tried having an IUD. When that had to be removed 3 months later due to side effects he signed me up for it with no hesitation. He is a younger dr so I think that helped.",Not the A-hole
AITA for demanding my mother stops photographing/recording/etc me?,"okay this is my first AITA and i wasn’t sure if this is worthy enough to post here, but im gonna do it anyways because what the hell?

so, i (17f) am a very insecure person for the most part. i’d get into it but for the sake of time, let’s just say i’m very insecure (especially over minute things other people wouldn’t notice). my mother loves to take photos of me and post them without my permission, which doesn’t coincide well with my insecurity issues. 

my mom knows she usually gets backlash when trying to take a picture, so she does it anyway. she also says “teeth” meaning i should smile widely. my regular close-mouthed smiles won’t do.

she also would take photos of me and edit makeup onto them, and then post it. i was NEVER a girly girl, so seeing her post this made me feel like she didn’t think i looked good enough. we argued and she stopped doing it. 

usually whenever she posts something of me and it turns into an argument between us, my dad takes my side, as he doesn’t like her posting photos of him either and gets annoyed with it too. 

tonight my dad called me and told me that dinner was ready. i went upstairs and my mother was talking to her aunt (who’s only 10 years older so they’re basically pals), and  her aunt told her to show me on camera. 

i’ve gained a little weight since the pandemic and for whatever reason my elders love to comment on it. so, i assumed that’s where i assumed this was going, and i said “no, please, i was just up here to get my dinner”.  

my mom completely ignored me and flipped the camera on me, and i verbally expressed that i didn’t like it. 

after the call was over, i said angrily to my mom, “why would you do that? stop showing me on camera, i mean it.”

she got offended and my dad hopped in to defend her, which was kind of a shock but whatever they’re married. they both said i was being way too overdramatic and that it “wasn’t worth all that”.

what do you guys think?

EDIT:: since i’m getting a few comments abt it, let me just clarify: my mother started editing the photos of me when i was 14/15 and it stopped after a heavy confrontation when i was 16 or so. it never happened again since, just the photo taking.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting my mother at my wedding?,"
AITA for not wanting my mother at my wedding. My mom lives in Florida and came to Texas for my bridal shower. I had not seen her for two years due to covid and financial issues. I made sure to take off a long weekend to spend with her, and Sunday was my bridal shower. Over 20 people came and I was busy making sure I interacted with all my guests. I got about two pictures with my mom (this will be important later) everyone had an amazing time and I felt the party went really well. 

Fast forward to after the shower my mom left immediately after even though her flight wasn’t until the following day and we were suppose to have dinner together. She was upset she did not feel prioritized and started talking about how she got no pictures at my shower. She told me I was inconsiderate for not taking pictures with her. I sent her the two pictures I had, and apologized stating that she was actually the ONLY person I took pictures with. 

She has not reached out to me since the shower which was about 2 weeks ago. I called her today and tried to talk to her about the situation. She told me I was a selfish jerk who didn’t consider her feelings. I explained how I felt she ruined my shower by leaving without saying goodbye after I had not seen her for two years and I thought we had such a good weekend. I explained how I got wrapped up in hosting. I told her she was behaving like her mother who she cut out of her life due to her being a narcissist.  I told her fuck this and at this point she was being abusive and prioritizing a picture over my happiness and our relationship. She said she was not coming to my wedding. 

I honestly have worried my mother would ruin my wedding day. Not the actual day but she would complain years to come about SOMETHING. Seeing how much shower played out confirmed some of my fears. I want her at my wedding, but I also really don’t does that make me an asshole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for thinking my wife (or anyone) shouldn't drive at all,"My wife was saying how her cousin refuses to drive anywhere without her husband in the car.  I asked why so, and she stated its because she doesn't feel comfortable driving with the kids in the car alone. I then stated that if she wasn't comfortable in her driving skills to drive with the kids in the car alone, then she shouldn't be driving at all.  My wife, got upset at this statement, and said she too feels this way, and hates driving any distance farther than out of town with the kids in the car without me. I do most the driving anyways and always chalked it up to that she just didn't want to have to stay awake the whole drive (We live almost an hour away from any major city/ chain stores).  She then stated that I don't need to attack someone for not feeling comfortable driving.  I then stated, if you cant feel comfortable driving with ""precious cargo"" arguably the time you need to be at your best, then you shouldn't be driving at all.  Am I the Asshole here, for thinking this way?",Asshole
AITA for bringing up the past and making my mom feel bad?,"So I (21) am a lesbian and am dating my girlfriend of over 5 years (24). 

Backstory: I knew I was into girls since I was in middle school and at first thought I was bi. When I came out to my mom for the first ever time, she told me it was just a phase and to NEVER tell anyone because I will get bullied. 

So, I basically shoved that down in the back of my mind and tried to act like she was right and I became ashamed. 

In high school, I came back out as bi and even dated my best friend (a whole other story that leads to a NIGHTMARE) and my mom once again, said it was a phase and 'how do you know you're bisexual if you've never had sex with a girl?' which is the most hypocritical and weirdest question I ever heard but anyways. The rest of my family were also homophobic in their own ways. 

Because of that, I kept my personal life with my sexuality to myself. By my sophomore year, I full accepted who I was and realized I am a lesbian. I met my girlfriend (calling her M) at that time in school and we were talking and I once again kept it from my mom until we became official. 

Mom was fine with it and acted as if she was always okay with it and now began to question why I'm lesbian because I dated guys in my past when I only did that because I felt like I HAD to. The rest of my family took it like I thought they would, which is acting as if I'm suddenly this horny 24/7 alien. 

Anyways, to the actual problem at hand:

This happened about a month ago but for some reason I was thinking of it. 

My mom and I were watching a movie and I honestly wish I could remember the name (edit: it's called Uncle Frank!) but it was about this gay man who kept his sexuality from his family for basically his entire life and when the secret finally came out we saw his family's reaction. His mother was 100% accepting and loving and that reaction made me suddenly break down. I was sobbing. 

My mom began looking at me weird and asking why I was crying and I said I wish I had that kind of experience with my family when I came out. She then began to say how she was always accepting of me. 

I guess I made a weird face and she began pushing me to speak so I came clean. I said she may be accepting now, but she wasn't before. So I didn't feel how the character on the movie felt. I had to keep it a secret and feel ashamed for most of my life. I went off on how she thought it was just a phase and how at one point she didn't agree with gay marriage and she begins screaming how she's not like that anymore. I explained how that isn't the same to how I felt then and she went off even more on how dare I bring up the shitty past to make her look bad. 

I said I was done and left. 

I can't help but feel I should've once again kept my mouth shut when it comes to my feelings and my sexuality because it caused a fight. AITA?

Edit: Not sure if this makes a difference but my mom 40. I think some people got the idea she was a bit older.

Edit 2: I met my girlfriend in our high school class when I was 15 and she was 17, turning 18. She is 2-3 years ahead of me. Our ages is not the topic at hand and I'd appreciate if people left my relationship alone.",Not the A-hole
"WIBTA if I ban a man from the children’s library, effectively banning the boy he takes care of?","Bit of a pickle here. I am a children’s librarian and things in my area are now opened up to the point the kids can come in and browse/do homework/ use the computers, all the library stuff essentially. The problem here is with an older guy, J. J watches a child of family friends, C. They come in the afternoons. C is a really nice kid. J is the issue. He asks a lot of personal questions and generally stands in front of my desk chatting until I have to divert the conversation so I can get work done. He also chats with some of the other kids, and recently asked a young girl to let him use her card (he had checked out the limit on his). 

After that particular incident, I really don’t want J in the children’s room. However; C’s parents are unreachable to let them know of the situation and J will not let C out of his sight. So if I ban J I will effectively be banning C as well. My managers have said this is up to me.

AITA for walking out on a patient and refusing to return,"Hello, I have had conflicting feedback about my situation. I do traveling healthcare as a nurse aide. I was given one patient that I would visit to give their main caretaker a break through the week. Feed, bathe, and just to generally make sure they were safe. Well, I figured out the caregiver was testing me. When I was prepping my patient's meals or getting supplies from my vehicle they were putting fake urine in my patient's brief and bed pad to make sure I was changing them timely. They would also wet the bed sheet to make sure I was changing the bed and things like that. I know this because I walked in on them pouring the urine one day because I was suspicious something was up because oftentimes my patient would actually urinate closely to these incidents and I thought that was odd so I walked away to ""get something"" and quickly circled back in. They fessed up about the testing to make sure I was doing my job correctly. Well, when I found this out I was furious because they were creating extra work for me because changing a bedridden person, especially doing a full bed change is not easy to do by yourself. I promptly reported this to my job and left because I do not appreciate people wasting my time and making me work twice as hard because of a test. Well, I got a phone call from my work because apparently, the caretaker wanted me to return because I was the only aide they had that had been attentive to the patient. I told my work I will not go back because they could have installed a nanny cam or done something more practical than making me do multiple bed changes and brief changes that were unnecessary, note this patient is larger so it is not an easy job to do alone. I have had some friends tell me it was an ah move to leave them like that since abuse and neglect are so prevalent in healthcare and the caretaker just wanted to make sure the patient was being properly cared for.",Not the A-hole
AITA for literally ignoring my mother when she popped by unannounced?,"My wife (30f) and I (32f, we're both women) are new parents to a baby girl. This is pretty big since just a few months ago we had our hearts broken (if anyone remembers my last post before it was taken down, we didn't pursue it further because it was just too much)

Saying as we never thought that we'd have a baby so quickly (though we are 150% over the moon!) we've also had a lot to learn as new parents. My wife's parents are perfect and amazing, they always help out even if they only pop by for an hour.

My mom, on the other hand, has a lot to say and butts in constantly. Pouts when we ask for the baby back, talks like the baby (""Mommy wants to take you away from Gramma, but I won't let her!"" ""Princess demands that Gramma changes her into a pretty outfit, Mommy put me in a BORING ONE."")

I have no more patience for my mom's steamrolling, especially since she's barely acknowledged my nephews since the baby came home. She even objects to her name and insists that we change it or call her by a nickname she deems acceptable. My mom's behavior is nothing new to me, so I told her several times not to drop in without calling, if she's 5 minutes away or 30 it doesn't matter. I don't want guests dropping in to sit in my messy living room to play with the baby while ignoring my wife and I, that doesn't fly with me.

On Sunday we were going to my IL's house for brunch and time to relax. I told my mom 3 times when we spoke on the phone during the week that we weren't taking visitors this weekend and had plans.

Wife and I were getting ready to leave. She was with the baby when I brought the diaper bag and stuff to the car. Who pulled up when my wife came out? My mom. I was already frustrated so I went right up to my wife, told her to pretend that she's not here and don't even look at her.

Mom starts talking at me (where are we going and why, how long we'll be) and I walk past her. Wife put the baby in the carseat, my mom said she was doing it wrong, as soon as my wife is in the car I look at my mom and ask why she didn't call. Mom insists she doesn't have to call when she was already down the street, I told her that's not how this works. My daughter is not a show pony and I am sick of her acting like she knows best while disrespecting my wife and I. Until she actually calls before she visits, we will not entertain her anymore.

When we returned home, my mom was waiting in her car for us. I had a feeling that she'd do something like that. Wifey and I had agreed to just ignore her and walk right past her when she tried to follow us. It was a little rude of me but I shut the door in her face. She called my cell over and over again waiting to be let inside but I just let it ring.

Needless to say I have been flooded with messages from relatives saying that I acted childish and cruel, how dare I keep my daughter away from her grandmother. The only people on our side are my sister and in-laws.

So tell me: am I an asshole for ignoring my mom the way I did?


Edit: Thanks for all the feedback so far. Post has only been up for an hour and I feel vindicated. Wifey and I already decided to put my mom and several other relatives on timeout. Especially since a lot of them showed no interest in our lives till we had a baby. Tells us all we need to know about their priorities.

AITA for wanting to name my son for a video game character?,"My wife (26F) and I (27M) are both big gamers.  We actually met through playing a game together online and it's important to us.  We're expecting a baby boy in October and we couldn't be happier! This will be the first child for all of us, and the first grandchild/nibling on both sides of our families. So they're pretty excited to meet him too.

Here's where the problem comes in.  My wife and I were both greatly moved by the story of Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption 2.  We consider him one of the best fictional characters of all time. I've been playing video games for a long time and his story is the only one to ever make me cry.  It was my wife who suggested that we use Arthur Morgan as the first and middle names for our son.  Not only would we be paying tribute to our favorite character, but there's nothing wrong or 'weird' about the names, other than Arthur is a little old-fashioned now.  But it isn't as if we're naming him Sonic the Hedgehog or Donkey Kong. 

My mother had a brother that died when I was about a year old, so I don't have any memories of him.  She has been pressuring us to name our son after him.  There's nothing wrong with his name, either.  It's pretty common, think something like ""Robert John"".  It's just not what we wish to name our sprout. 

My older brother left slip to my mother that the name we chose was from a video game character and she completely flipped out.  She actually drove 30 minutes to our house so she could bang on our door and berate us in person for honoring someone who doesn't actually exist over her flesh-and-blood sibling. I understand that she still misses my uncle, but while this is may be her grandchild, he is still first and foremost *our* son and we already think of him as Arthur.  That's going to be his name no matter how she feels about it.  When we tried gently (and then firmly) to advise her that we respected her position but that we weren't going to budge on ours, she walked out and told us that she would have nothing to do with our son and would never acknowledge him as family. 

AITA for not making my mother happy and just giving her a freebie on this? I've actually always had a really good relationship with her and it would hurt badly not to have her in my life or my son's life.  My wife says that as parents we are going to have to learn to advocate for ourselves because people are always going to be telling us that we've done something wrong and and disagreeing with our parenting decisions.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for buying a toy that I only want my nephew to use at my house, and not letting my sister in-law take home?","Yesterday morning, I (25F) found a power wheels john deere tractor at a yard sale that didn't work, but was only $15 and I thought it was worth getting for my nephew (3M) to see if my bf (27M) could fix it.  I moved in with my bf last weekend and he has a big field that I thought my nephew would love to ride it in.  I bought it yesterday morning, and then yesterday evening after my bf got off of work we took his truck to the house and picked it up, they also had a little trailer that went with it that they threw in for free!  My bf and his friend worked on it for like an hour once we got home and ended up getting it working by taking apart the gear shifter and cleaning the electrical connections inside it.  I was pretty excited to show my nephew.

Every month I spend a day watching my nephew so that my brother (28M) and sister in-law (28F) can relax and get stuff done.  I also really enjoy spending time with him.  Normally, I'll take him to the zoo or the beach or someplace like that but he is potty training right now and I didn't feel comfortable going anywhere so I decided to just hang out with him at my house with my bf and give him the tractor to drive around.

He had a blast with the tractor, he would drive around the field, pick up sticks and rocks and put them in the trailer and then move them somewhere else.  He had a huge grin the entire time, and by the time the battery went dead he was getting pretty good at driving it.

When my sister in-law came to pick him up he showed her his new tractor and she wanted to put it in their suv to take home.  I said that I preferred the tractor to stay at my house so that he would be excited to come over and play with it, and they don't have a very big yard to drive it in.  She then proceeded to say I was being an asshole (in nicer words) for getting him a really cool present that he is only allowed to use at my house.",Not the A-hole
