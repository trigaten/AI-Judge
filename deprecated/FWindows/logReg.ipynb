My wedding dress was a dress my mom made for me when I was 11. She knew she was sick and she was a dressmaker and so I asked her to make me a dress for prom and my wedding for the future. They were basically the same dress just one was pink and the other was white lol, but they mean the world to me. Both needed to be altered when I reached the point of wearing them but luckily my grandma is also a dressmaker and she did it for me.\n",

She didn't know my mom though and they were nothing to each other. So for the sentimental part, and the part where she didn't even know my mom and couldn't share in that side of the sentimentality, I said no. I didn't want to give away my dress. Maybe if I have a daughter, or a daughter in law I'm close to someday, I might offer it there or give it to them if they want it. But for now I want to keep both and not share.\n",

My dad is pissed because this is the second time she wanted one of them. She wanted my prom dress as well and he said I should have been willing to share one since my stepsister has always looked up to me. Liz is pissed because I wouldn't let her fix my prom dress at the time (she offered with very little experience fitting dresses) and went to my grandma instead and now I won't let her daughter wear the dress. They all say it's been 5 years now and the wedding dress won't be worn again by me (which might not be true, my husband and I have talked about renewing our vows far in the future and wearing the same clothes).\n",
