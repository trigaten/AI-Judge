## Data Source

https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/ Remember AITA started in 2013, so we only need data from there on.

### AUX
Contains files from some simple classification experiments I was doing previously with post-only data. It contains some useful functionality like loading csv into 
pandas, cleaning, stemming, and tokenizing (mostly in processing.py).
